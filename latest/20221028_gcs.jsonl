But the 15-month-old, normally energetic and adventurous, wasn’t herself on Saturday.\n\n“She hated it, and she normally loves water,” Sizemore said.\n\nBy Sunday, when the family was heading back to Ohio, the little girl was “coughing like crazy.”\n\n“She coughed so hard, she threw up,” Sizemore said. Raegan also stopped eating and developed a fever.\n\nWhen Tylenol didn’t help, Sizemore took her to urgent care and told them that RSV or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cold-like virus, was going around at Raegan’s day care, where Sizemore also works.\n\nThe test came back positive, and Raegan’s vital signs prompted the staffers at the urgent care to tell Sizemore to take her daughter to the hospital.\n\nAs soon as they saw her vitals, the staff at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland knew they had to admit Raegan, her mom said. She needed oxygen.\n\n“They’ve been great here and taken good care of her, but the scariest part is, had I not already known she was exposed to RSV, I may have just let her cough it out,” Sizemore said. “I’m glad I didn’t wait.”\n\nMost kids catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, and it’s usually mild. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. They typically last a week or two, and clear up with rest and fluids.\n\nBut in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\nNow, there’s an “unprecedented” rise in RSV cases among children in the US, some doctors tell CNN.\n\nThe CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV like it does for flu, but it said Thursday there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with patients at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nOverall, pediatric hospital beds are more full now than they’ve been in the past two years, according to federal data.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services does not specify the reason for hospitalization, but about three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds available nationwide are being used now. By comparison, pediatric hospital beds were about two-thirds full on an average day over the past two years.\n\n‘Never seen this level of surge’\n\nWith the RSV surge, UH Rainbow Babies has had so many patients, it went on diversion for a couple of days in early October, meaning it couldn’t take external emergency admissions. It’s taking patients again now, but it’s still slammed with RSV cases.\n\nThere has been such such a dramatic increase in cases in Connecticut that Connecticut Children’s Hospital has been coordinating with the governor and public health commissioner to determine whether it should bring the National Guard in to expand its capacity to care for these young patients.\n\n“I’ve been doing this a long time. I’ve been at Connecticut Children’s for 25 years, and I’ve never seen this level of surge specifically for RSV coming into our hospital,” Dr. Juan Salazar, the hospital’s executive vice president and physician in chief, told CNN.\n\nIn Texas, where RSV cases usually spike in December or January, the emergency department at Cook Children’s in Fort Worth and its urgent cares are seeing a significant number of RSV cases. Nearly half the ICU is filled with RSV cases, hospital spokesperson Kim Brown said; between October 2 and 8, there were 210 RSV cases at Cook Children’s; a week later, there were 288.\n\nJeff and Zoey Green’s 4-month-old, Lindy, was admitted to Cook on Sunday.\n\nAt the hospital, Lindy’s fever was so high at one point they said they used ice packs to cool her down.\n\n“I don’t know how but she slept with those ice packs on top of her,” Zoey Green said, holding an exhausted Lindy at the hospital. She said they’re trying to keep her hydrated so she doesn’t have to go back on an IV.\n\n“We want her to be better, for sure.”\n\nDr. Mallory Davis, an infection preventionist at Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is also seeing an early surge.\n\n“We are very full, and our census numbers are pretty high as we work through kind of figuring out how to accommodate all of the sick kiddos in the community,” she said.\n\nChildren’s Hospital Colorado has seen an early uptick in RSV hospitalizations and is starting to see the first few flu cases of the season, said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n“We have been seeing increased patient volumes since the late summer, which started with rhinoviruses and enteroviruses as children returned to school, and now is being driven by RSV and parainfluenza,” he said. “With influenza season rapidly approaching with what appears to be an early start, we are concerned about the persistently increased volumes of sick children requiring hospitalization.”\n\nAt UH Rainbow Babies, staff are hoping things don’t get much worse. “I mean, I hope we’re peaking right now, because if we’re not, then holy hell,” said Dr. Amy Edwards, associate medical director for pediatric infection control.\n\nRSV cases can often fill hospitals, even in regular seasons, since there aren’t many treatments and it can require several days of supportive care in severe cases, Edwards said.\n\nIll children “need that oxygen support, so they can’t be at home,” she said.\n\nExperts think US cases may be spiking now because of the phase of the Covid-19 pandemic that we’re in.\n\nWhen everyone stayed home in 2020 and 2021 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it seemed to change the typical RSV season. Case counts were low, and that created an “immunity gap.”\n\nKids who normally would have caught the virus in those years are instead catching it now.\n\nWho’s vulnerable to RSV\n\nThe CDC says most kids will catch RSV at some point before they turn 2. It’s a highly contagious virus that often doesn’t cause serious illness, except in adults who are elderly or have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, and in some infants and children.\n\nThere’s no specific treatment for RSV and no vaccine. The symptoms usually last a week or two and clear up with plenty of fluids and rest.\n\nFor some kids, though, it can be a much more serious disease. RSV can be especially dangerous for preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\nRSV can turn into bronchiolitis, in which the small airways can become inflamed and congested, or pneumonia. A child may need to stay in the hospital so they can get extra oxygen or even mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.\n\nHow RSV spreads\n\nAn infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.\n\nRSV symptoms RSV is a common virus, but it can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants and older adults. Symptoms may appear in stages and not all at once, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing and sneezing Fever Wheezing “In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties,” according to the CDC.\n\nIt’s generally such a mild illness that adults often don’t realize they have it, or they think it’s nothing more than a cold or allergies and go on to interact with others.\n\n“It’s not a fatiguing virus the way influenza or Covid is, so you really do feel fine,” Edwards said. “And then what happens is, your neighbor has that beautiful baby, and you bring over a casserole, and you kiss that little baby because you feel fine. You don’t feel sick. And unfortunately, you pass it on to them, and sometimes they end up at the hospital.”\n\nOlder siblings can also pass the virus along to younger ones.\n\n“Babies slobber on toys and on each other and everything else, so day cares pass it along, too,” Edwards said.\n\nIf your child is coughing or lethargic, or if they just don’t seem like themselves, it’s a good idea to take them to their pediatrician. The doctor’s office will have the tests to figure out if it’s RSV, the flu, Covid-19 or strep.\n\nPediatricians say a trip to the ER may be necessary if a baby is dehydrated; if they have difficult, labored, shallow or rapid breathing; if they have a high fever or bluish skin; or if they become unresponsive. The CDC says most improve with supportive care and can often go home after a few days.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\n“Hand hygiene is the single most important thing that we can do to keep ourselves and others safe,” said Davis, of the children’s hospital in Grand Rapids. She tells people to never touch their faces unless they recently washed their hands.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen kids or grownups are sick, they need to do one thing and one thing only, she said: “Stay home when you are sick so you won’t spread whatever respiratory illness you have.”\n\nSizemore, whose daughter is still in the hospital with RSV but seems to be getting better, also advises people to take the virus seriously.\n\n“I would like other parents to know they shouldn’t watch their child’s cough lightly and take symptoms seriously,” she said. “This could have been a much worse situation if we didn’t get Raegan help.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Raenu Charles", "Jen Christensen", "Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/health/childrens-hospital-beds-delayed-care-long-waits/index.html", "title": "While respiratory viruses surge, shortage of pediatric hospital beds ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nParents who need to take a child to the emergency room are facing agonizing waits in many parts of the United States because of a shortage of hospital beds.\n\nHospitals across the country say they are being overwhelmed by an early surge in respiratory infections including RSV, influenza and enterovirus. As a result, pediatric hospital beds are more full now than they have been in the past two years, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThis crush of young patients filling hospitals now means those with less urgent illnesses may face long waits and sometimes days-long stays in the ER while they wait to be admitted. It also means kids who need cancer treatment or surgery may be sent home to wait until hospitals have beds.\n\nPediatric beds are so full in San Antonio that Elena Mikalsen drove her 17-year-old daughter to an emergency room 45 minutes away in the hopes that she could be seen more quickly there. She knew hospitals closer to home were already full.\n\nHer daughter hasn’t been able to eat or drink since Thursday because of a sharp pain in her abdomen that gets worse after she eats. Last week, she began vomiting and having chills.\n\nAfter blood tests and an ultrasound in the ER, doctors determined that she needed to have her gallbladder removed. It was full of gallstones.\n\n“What’s happened with my daughter is, she should have been admitted last night, as someone who can’t eat or drink and is in pain and is a child,” Mikalsen said Monday.\n\nNormally in a case like this, the hospital would put the person on the surgery schedule and keep her hydrated and comfortable until the procedure. But there aren’t any available beds, so her daughter is waiting at home.\n\nMikalsen knows this process intimately because in addition to being a worried mom, she works in health care.\n\nShe asked CNN not to name her employer because she wasn’t authorized to speak on their behalf. She also asked not to use her daughter’s name to protect her privacy.\n\n“We don’t want to take a bed away from a baby, because that’s what’s really happening right now,” Mikalsen said. “Very little ones coming in who are suffocating, so they need all the beds.”\n\nFor now, her daughter is resting at home and taking medication to relieve the pain.\n\nThere are risks involved with delaying the surgery. Gallstones can block the the tiny tubes that carry the digestive juices that are made by the gallbladder to the small intestine. That may lead to an swelling, intense pain and an infection, which can trigger sepsis.\n\n“It is nerve-wracking,” Mikalsen said. “We had the surgeon on the phone last night and the doctor. They ran all kinds of tests on her in the ER and they were like, ‘well, she’s not dying. We’re not going to prioritize a bed for her.’ “\n\nMikalsen even tried to get her daughter an adult bed at local hospitals, but they were told she still needs pediatric care. She has a list of symptoms to keep an eye on – signs that her daughter’s condition could be worsening. And they have an upcoming appointment to see a doctor for a consultation, but no promise of upcoming surgery.\n\n“My instructions are strict bed rest, no food, just fluids and pain medication, so that’s what we have to do. She misses school and I miss work until we get this figured out,” Mikalsen said.\n\nUnprecedented numbers of cases\n\nTexas isn’t the only state being impacted. A spokesperson for Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Rhode Island told CNN the hospital is at 125% capacity and has been having issues with bed space for about a month.\n\nSeattle Children’s Hospital says it is seeing double the number patients they would normally see in October. On any given day, for most of the day, it’s at about 200% of its physical capacity in the emergency department.\n\n“RSV is on the rise, and last week 30% of respiratory viral tests in Seattle Children’s Emergency Department were positive for RSV. In the past, when we’ve reached 30-40% positivity, we are at peak, which typically lasts for 2 months,” said Emergency Services Dr. Russell Migita, in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Health alerted hospital systems in the state that they are running out of pediatric intensive care beds. As of Friday, just 6% of the 289 PICU beds remained open statewide.\n\n“That’s actually an optimistic number,” says Dr. Deanna Behrens, a pediatric critical care specialist at a children’s hospital in Chicago. She asked that CNN not identify the hospital because she didn’t have permission from her employer to talk about the shortage.\n\nBehrens says that 289 refers to the number of licensed intensive care beds available, but because of staff shortages, hospitals may not have enough nurses to keep that many beds open for patients.\n\n“It’s like nothing that I’ve ever seen before in the decade that I’ve been doing this in terms of the amount of kids that we have with all these respiratory illnesses,” she said. “The number of kids we are seeing is very unusual.”\n\nBehrens says her hospital has sent children as far as St. Louis for intensive care when it didn’t have available beds.\n\nIt’s the same story in Minneapolis.\n\n“Our total ER volumes are the highest they’ve ever been in our emergency department right now. So our overall number of patients per day,” said Dr. Marissa Hendrickson, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at M Health Fairview Masonic Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis.\n\nNearly all the kids seen there are sick with respiratory viruses, especially RSV.\n\n“We still do our best to get people who are more ill and need more immediate attention back to rooms as quickly as possible,” Hendrickson said. “But sometimes, when things are busy enough, we aren’t even able to do that.\n\n“And then we ended up caring for people in non-traditional spaces like hallways or trying to start their care actually physically in the waiting room. So we’re squeezing people in as best we can,” she said.\n\n‘These hospitals are overwhelmed’\n\nIn Atlanta, Katie McKoy says she recently waited nearly three weeks to get cancer scans for her 14-year-old son, Matthew, who goes by Mattie.\n\nMattie has a rare genetic condition called spinal variant neurofibromatosis type one, which causes tumors to grow on his spinal cord and compress his nerves. Because of where they’re growing, the tumors have paralyzed his diaphragm, the muscle that sits underneath the rib cage and controls breathing. He breathes with the help of a tube in his windpipe and machines.\n\nWith hospital beds in short supply, Mattie McKoy waited weeks for scans he needed. Katie McKoy\n\nMattie’s condition will shorten his life, but McKoy says he could live five or 10 more years with good care. He takes an oral chemotherapy drug to slow the growth of his tumors and to space out his surgeries.\n\nWhen he recently got weaker, his doctors decided it was time for another round of scans.\n\n“We’re using these scans to decide, when is it time for hospice? When is it time for surgery? And to make those really gut-wrenching decisions,” McKoy said.\n\nMattie has to be admitted to the hospital when he goes for imaging. He has autism and can’t stay in the machines without sedation. Because his medical needs are so complex, he needs intensive care during each trip.\n\nMcKoy said Mattie’s most recent set of scans was originally scheduled for September 26, but that appointment was canceled for lack of space.\n\nChildren’s Healthcare of Atlanta has been using surge tents for emergency room overflow since August, when respiratory illnesses began an out-of-season climb. Children’s says the tents are for mild injury and illness, not only RSV patients. Wait times in the emergency department vary through the day but average around three hours or more.\n\nThe doctors started making calls and eventually secured a spot in a hospital bed that would normally have been reserved for someone who needed rehabilitation. The McKoys took it because nursing coverage was better for those beds, but it wasn’t the same level of attention he would have gotten in the intensive care unit.\n\nMattie finally got his scans on October 18.\n\nAlhough his family says they are grateful for the incredible medical team at Children’s, the level of care he needs is very difficult to get right now.\n\n“Other pediatric hospitals are in just as bad of a situation. It’s a nationwide crisis,” McKoy said. “These hospitals are overwhelmed.”\n\nAllyson Wright, a spokesperson for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said that because of patient privacy laws, the hospital can’t comment on the specifics of this case, and “decisions about transferring patients are reassessed daily both within Children’s and with our partner hospitals as needed to ensure that care is provided expeditiously and safely.\n\nIf Mattie’s health suddenly declines, his mom says, she’ll have no choice but to take him to the emergency room for care. His immunity is low because of his underlying health conditions and his cancer treatment, so if he catches an infection while waiting in the ER, it could kill him.\n\n“Honestly, I’m terrified,” McKoy said. “I’m afraid of him dying this flu season because he gets sick and the infrastructure of the hospital system in general isn’t able to care for him because there are so many other sick kids and there’s no bed available for him. That’s my deepest fear.”\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nTo make the most of hospital capacity for kids, public health officials are urging parents to protect their children from respiratory infections by making sure children have recently been vaccinated against Covid-19 and influenza and being cautious to prevent sharing germs.\n\nDoctors who care for kids in the hospital ask parents to seek out their pediatrician, when possible, before heading to a packed ER.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSome children shouldn’t wait. Respiratory symptoms that require urgent medical attention include fast or labored breathing. In a baby, that might mean that their nostrils flare with every breath, or their head may bob as they try to breathe.\n\n“When children are having trouble breathing, they pull in the muscles so that you can see their ribs outline with every breath or you can see their stomach sucking in and out in a way that it doesn’t normally do. Or the muscles in the neck and that go up by their shoulders over the collarbone can pull in with their breath,” said Hendrickson, the pediatric emergency medicine physician in Minneapolis.\n\n“The other thing would be to watch for dehydration. So sometimes, little kids – even a baby with a stuffy nose – can sometimes have trouble drinking. It’s hard to drink a bottle if your nose is stuffy. And so sometimes, they just sort of give up, and they don’t drink enough,” she said.\n\nIt’s OK if they’re not eating, she said, as long as they’re still getting enough fluids. Keep an eye on the number of wet diapers a baby has every day.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/rsv-immunity-gap/index.html", "title": "RSV: Pandemic 'immunity gap' is probably behind surge in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe measures that helped keep us safe from Covid-19 over the past 2½ years – lockdowns, physical distancing, wearing masks, washing hands – also helped limit the spread of other viruses. As people return to school and work and take off their masks, those viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and flu, are back in full force.\n\nThat “immunity gap” from the last few years is probably behind the “unprecedented” early surge in RSV infections this year, scientists say – and it has thrown other seasonal respiratory viruses out of whack around the world.\n\n“As long as we’ve had a record of RSV and other respiratory diseases in the United States, there have been these very regular patterns of outbreaks,” said Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Brown University.\n\n“RSV pops up every year in the late autumn/wintertime and has these outbreaks mostly in young kids. Then it disappears again for the spring/summer months and pops up again the following winter,” Baker said. “It’s very regular and predictable.”\n\nUntil it isn’t.\n\nCases of RSV in the United States started showing up in the spring and are now 60% higher than 2021’s peak week, a CNN analysis shows, and that’s probably an undercount.\n\nAcross the US, the number of flu cases has also been increasing a little earlier than usual. A handful of schools have seen large absences, and medical offices say they are seeing more people sick with other respiratory viruses at times that don’t fit the usual patterns.\n\nThere have been similar unusual patterns in respiratory infections such as adenovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus in other countries, too.\n\nScientists think unparalleled actions of the pandemic had unparalleled effects.\n\nCovid interventions stopped other viruses, too\n\n“The degree of societal changes that occurred with the Covid pandemic really is unprecedented in modern day,” said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Colorado.\n\nLike Covid-19, RSV and the flu spread through droplets released into the air when people cough or sneeze. The droplets also linger for hours on frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs and light switches.\n\nSo the people who washed hands and disinfected surfaces, who wore masks and kept their distance from others, did more than stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n“Those interventions, while they were great at limiting the spread of Covid-19, they also did a really good job of limiting the spread of other respiratory diseases such as RSV and influenza,” Baker said.\n\nThere was a sudden dropoff in RSV cases and hospitalizations in the seasons of 2020 and 2021, studies have showed, as well as unusually tame flu seasons.\n\n“It was really striking,” Baker said.\n\nBut as Covid-19 vaccines and treatments became available, more people started going back to school and work and interacting without masks. They also started sharing germs. The pandemic behaviors created an “immunity gap” or “immunity debt” that makes more people in the US vulnerable to diseases like RSV.\n\nUnderstanding the immunity gap\n\nChildren build natural immunity to viruses when they’re exposed to them. Most kids catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Newborns get some passive protection from their mothers, who pass along antibodies through breast milk.\n\nBut for a couple of years, there was little opportunity for children born during the pandemic or the people around them to catch RSV – or other viruses, for that matter. Their immunity waned or never formed at all. So when those little ones and their parents started to interact with others, they were more likely to get sick.\n\n“Decreased exposure to endemic viruses created an immunity gap – a group of susceptible individuals who avoided infection and therefore lack pathogen-specific immunity to protect against future infection,” Messacar and Baker wrote this summer in a commentary published in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nThey warned hospitals that they needed to remain flexible and prepared for unpredictable seasons of respiratory illnesses because of this gap.\n\n“We knew it was inevitable that these diseases would come back,” Messacar told CNN.\n\nThe commentary warned about an influx of infections that would include older children who hadn’t been exposed to viruses as well as newborns whose moms weren’t able to pass along antibodies because they hadn’t been in contact with these germs.\n\n“Now we’re seeing it’s spreading really well,” Baker said. “And it’s not just striking the kids that it would typically strike with that first birth cohort. It’s also creating infections in older kids.\n\n“That’s how infectious diseases work,” she added. “Once you have more cases, they create more cases, and you get this spike.”\n\nBaker and Messacar don’t think this early-season pattern with RSV is permanent, but it could take a while to return to its more predictable cycle.\n\n“Now we’re in a little bit of a strange period, but I think in the next few years, we’ll start to see those regular outbreaks – well, depending on what happens with Covid,” Baker said. If the coronavirus gets bad enough that more lockdowns are necessary, it could once again throw off the seasonality of other viruses.\n\nWith viruses like the flu, there are more variables involved, Messacar said.\n\nThere’s no vaccine to prevent RSV, but there is for flu, so if the flu shot is a good match for the strain in circulation and enough people get it, the country could avoid a spike in cases like it’s seeing now with RSV.\n\nScientists are working on an RSV vaccine, but it won’t come in time to help this season.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things to do to limit the spread of RSV, and they’ll sound very familiar.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWash your hands. Keep frequently used surfaces clean. Sneeze or cough into a tissue or into your elbow rather than your hands. Boost your immunity by getting plenty of sleep and eating a healthy diet. Wear a mask, especially when you’re sick. And most important, if you’re sick, stay home.\n\n“These non-pharmaceutical interventions all work, clearly, and the more we can do to keep cases of any of these viruses down, the better,” Baker said.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/us/rsv-father-parents-texas-childrens-hospital/index.html", "title": "Father of infant hospitalized with RSV warns parents to be alert as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLast week, Stephen Balka found himself living a parent’s nightmare. His 2-month-old son Adrian was struggling to breathe, sometimes going as long as seven seconds between gasping breaths, the father said.\n\n“It’s a very terrifying situation,” Balka said. “It’s one of my biggest fears.”\n\nAfter rushing Adrian to the ER, Balka and his wife were told their son had RSV, a common respiratory virus that some doctors say is spreading at unusually high levels and can cause severe illness in some infants, according to the CDC.\n\nThe Balkas took Adrian back home after initially getting cleared by doctors. But the infant’s labored breathing quickly returned. Once again, they hurried to the ER, where they waited for hours before being transferred to Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, the father said.\n\nAdrian has been hospitalized for a week in the hospital’s intensive care unit, where Balka said he is making significant progress.\n\n“If we would have waited any longer, or we would have just taken him home, you know, and kind of just gave him a little medicine, he probably would not have made it on his own,” Balka said.\n\nMore than 40 children are hospitalized at Texas Children’s Hospital with RSV, including at least 10 in the ICU, according to Dr. Melanie Kitagawa, director of the hospital’s pediatric ICU.\n\nStephen Balka stands over his son Adrian, who is hospitalized at Texas Children's Hospital with RSV. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nKitagawa said the hospital is seeing an unusually early surge in patients with RSV, which typically spikes around December or January in Texas.\n\n“It’s terrible to, to have any family or any child have to go through this,” she said.\n\nThe Houston hospital is one of several children’s hospitals that are seeing abnormally high numbers of RSV cases this season. Some doctors have told CNN they are overwhelmed with the unexpected flood of hospitalizations, some of which require several days of supportive care for more severe cases.\n\nMost children will catch RSV before they turn 2, according to the CDC, and the cases are typically mild. But in young infants and other children with weakened immune or respiratory systems, the illness can be dangerous, causing dehydration, trouble breathing, and potentially more serious illnesses like bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\nStanding in the doorway of his child’s ICU room, Balka urged other parents not to hesitate to seek care for their child.\n\n“Don’t wait,” he said. “If you feel as if something is wrong with your child, you know your child better than anyone does.

Young infants may seem only irritable or lethargic and have trouble breathing.\n\nNot every child will have every potential RSV symptom.\n\n“Fevers are really hit or miss with RSV infections, especially in young infants,” said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n\nParents should watch for any changes in behavior, she said, including taking longer to eat or not being interested in food at all. The child can also develop a severe cough and some wheezing.\n\nIt’s also important to watch for signs that your child is struggling to breathe or breathing with their ribs or belly – “symptoms which may kind of overlap with many of the other viruses that we’re seeing a resurgence of,” Soni added.\n\nSince it’s not easy for parents to tell the difference between respiratory illnesses like, say, RSV and flu, it’s good to take a sick child to a pediatrician, who can run tests to pinpoint the cause.\n\n“You may need to take your baby to be evaluated sooner rather than later,” Soni said.\n\nWhen it comes to RSV, parents should be especially cautious if their children are preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\n“Parents should be really astute to any changes, like in their activity and their appetite, and then pay particular attention to any signs of respiratory distress,” Soni said.\n\nRSV treatment\n\nTesting is important because treatment for things like flu and Covid-19 may differ.\n\nThere’s no antiviral or specific treatment for RSV like there is for the flu, nor is there a vaccine. But if your child is sick, there are things you can do to help.\n\nFever and pain can be managed with non-aspirin pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Also make sure your child drinks enough fluids.\n\n“RSV can make kids very dehydrated, especially when they’re not eating or drinking, especially when we’re talking infants,” Mora said. “Once they stop eating or their urine output has decreased, they’re not having as many wet diapers, this is a sign they may have to go to the pediatrician or emergency department.”\n\nTalk to your pediatrician before giving your child any over-the-counter cold medicines, which can sometimes contain ingredients that aren’t good for kids.\n\nWhen to go to the hospital\n\nYour pediatrician will check the child’s respiratory rate – how fast they’re breathing – and their oxygen levels. If your child is very sick or at high risk of severe illness, the doctor may want them to go to a hospital.\n\n“RSV can be super dangerous for some young infants and younger kids, particularly those that are less than 2 years of age,” Soni said.\n\nMora said labored breathing is a sign that a child is having trouble with this virus. RSV can turn into more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and that can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nIf you see that a child’s chest is moving up and down when they breathe, if their cough won’t let them sleep or if it’s getting worse, “that might be a sign that they need to seek help from their pediatrician or take them to the emergency department, because then they might need a supplemental oxygen, or they may need a nebulization treatment.”\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen says this respiratory difficulty – including a bobbing head, a flaring nose or grunting – is one of two major trouble signs with any respiratory infection. The other is dehydration. “That particularly applies to babies with stuffy noses. They may not be feeding.”\n\nMuch of the care provided by hospital staff will be to help with breathing.\n\n“We provide supportive measures for RSV and these kids with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory therapies, including suctioning,” Soni said.\n\nA thin tube may need to be inserted into their lungs to remove mucus. A child can get extra oxygen through a mask or through a tube that attaches to their nose. Some children may need to use an oxygen tent. Those who are struggling a lot may need a ventilator.\n\nSome babies might also need to be fed by tube.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf a caregiver or older sibling is sick, Mora says, they should wear a mask around other people and wash their hands frequently.\n\nAnd most of all, if anyone is sick – child or adult – they should stay home so they don’t spread the illness.\n\nThere is a monoclonal antibody treatment for children who are at highest risk for severe disease.

But even as babies struggling to breathe fill hospital beds across the United States, there may be a light ahead: After decades of disappointment, four new RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the US Food and Drug Administration, and more than a dozen others are in testing.\n\nThere’s also hope around a promising long-acting injection designed to be given right after birth to protect infants from the virus for as long as six months. In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he’s “hopeful” there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n“As soon as he qualified, we were like ‘absolutely, we are in,’ ” Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health – the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand. A recent patient was in the back of her mind when she was signing up James for the study.\n\n“I took care of a baby who was only a few months older than him and had had nine days of fever and was just absolutely pitiful and puny,” she said. Brown said his family felt helpless. “And I was like, ‘this is why we’re doing it. This single patient is why we’re doing this.’ “\n\nEven before this year’s surge, RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the US. The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven’t had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n“Unfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,” said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n“The original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn’t understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‘oh no, this ain’t gonna work.’ And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n“It is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,” Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn’t communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins – essentially flattening them.\n\n“Now you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,” said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“Everything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,” said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that’s being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn’t work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn’t spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren’t later challenged with the live virus.\n\n“So of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they’re ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren’t early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,” Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH – some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines – reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus’s F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it’s in when it first enters the body – and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n“The companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,” said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. “And now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.”\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns – a group particularly vulnerable to the virus – via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen – the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson – relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that’s used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was “delighted” with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective – 94% – for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n“We are very pleased with these results,” Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving “with all due haste” to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n“We’re confident enough that we’ve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,” he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK’s trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen’s vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer’s vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a “game-changer.”\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they’ve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines – a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n“We’ve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,” Chu said. “So I think this is imminent.”\n\nWatching this year’s RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can’t come fast enough.\n\n“The hospital is surging. We’re not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they’re really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,” she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn’t have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it’s far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles. The hardest part for squirmy James, she said, was being held still.\n\n“If we can do anything to move science forward and help another child, like, sorry, James.

Former finance minister Rishi Sunak has emerged as the front-runner after Boris Johnson dramatically dropped out of the race. A fast-tracked process could see Sunak announced as prime minister at 9 a.m. ET today – if he is able to secure the support of 100 MPs in the Conservative Party, leaving him unopposed in the contest. Sunak’s only competition is Cabinet member Penny Mourdant, who came in third during the summer. The contest is being staged after Liz Truss quit the top job last week, becoming Britain’s shortest-serving leader ever. Sunak came in second to Truss during the previous contest, but his repeated warnings about her economic plan were proven accurate in record time, resulting in a healthy number of backers within the party.\n\n2. RSV\n\nA common respiratory virus known as RSV is spreading at unusually high levels in the US and is overwhelming children’s hospitals. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include a runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing, according to the CDC. But in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and serious illnesses. The CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV as it does for the flu, but it said last week there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with these cases at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Doctor explains what RSV symptoms to look for 01:45 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

With the jury selection beginning today, it’s a symbolic moment following years of investigations against Trump’s real estate business. Two of Trump Organization entities are charged with nine counts of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees. A possible plea deal was discussed, but Trump and his team rebuffed it, partly due to the potential political impact it could have of admitting any guilt.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Top reporters reveal what's happening inside Trump's orbit now 05:03 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

But it’s much worse in certain areas: In Rhode Island, for example, beds are 99% full.\n\nSeasonal respiratory viruses fill children’s hospitals every year, but the number of beds that are full now is well above the average.\n\nOver the past couple years, only about two-thirds of pediatric beds have typically been in use – and that includes the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDriving much of the current need for beds at children’s hospitals is a spike in cases of RSV, which are 60% higher than at 2021’s peak. The early start to the flu season and an increase in other respiratory viruses are compounding the need for care, on top of all the usual demands like kids with broken bones or asthma attacks.\n\nChildren’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, warned last week that “this surge in illness is exacerbated by the national healthcare workforce shortages.” A child with a life-threatening emergency will not wait, the statement said, but “families who come to us with non-urgent issues will experience long waits to be seen.”\n\n“The wait times in county emergency departments and children’s hospitals are stretching to longer they’ve ever been,” said Dr. Meghan Bernier, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nComplicating the issue is that the staff shortage problem isn’t new and won’t be solved quickly. US hospitals have been dealing with it for years.\n\nMissing nurses the most\n\nThe country needs more doctors and technicians, as shortages are growing in both areas, experts say – but the lack of nurses may be the biggest gap that needs to be filled.\n\nA 2022 analysis found that the total count of nurses in the US decreased by more than 100,000 from 2020 to 2021, the largest drop observed over the past four decades. Many who left were under the age of 35, and most worked at hospitals.\n\nIt’s a particular problem for children’s hospitals.\n\n“The pediatric ICU specialty … is highly specialized and a difficult to recruit role in hospitals today,” Katie Boston-Leary, director of nursing programs at the American Nurses Association, told CNN in an email.\n\nWhen new staffers come in, it costs more to train them. Everyone who works with children needs an additional layer of training beyond what they would get in standard nursing school. That narrows the pool of people eligible to work in these hospitals, too.\n\nThere’s also a serious problem with turnover. Nurse turnover is up 50% across the country since 2019, according to Mark Wietecha, CEO of the Children’s Hospital Association.\n\n“Some of our nurses became (traveling nurses); some retired early; some were poached by our adult hospital colleagues,” he said. “We lost people, and costs are way up.”\n\nThis high demand means hospitals have to pay more to retain and hire nurses. And working with children is labor intensive, taking up more of staffers’ time.\n\nTemporary tents to create additional capacity can help in the short term, but the country will probably see some of the same surge capacity problems with RSV next year and the year after that, Wietecha says. He thinks it will take a government effort to fix the problem.\n\n“We know that there’s a train coming down the tracks. The government has been responsive at a level, but why don’t we have a road map for pediatric surge?”\n\nFull children’s hospitals are just one example of a larger problem, Boston-Leary said.\n\n“We have a nurse staffing crisis, and we need a whole-of-government response to address this public health crisis,” she said.\n\nLulla said his hospital in Rhode Island is “aggressively recruiting” to increase staff where it can, but it is competing with other hospitals, home health organizations, nursing homes and doctor’s offices that are also short-staffed.\n\n“We’re doing the best that we can to try to use the resources that we have,” he said.\n\nLonger waits and more mistakes\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated staff shortages across the health care industry, with people forced out by burnout, trauma and exhaustion, according to research from HHS. But even before 2020, stress and burnout were “already significant problems.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, many staffers who weren’t dealing directly with Covid-19 were furloughed or saw their hours cut because so many people weren’t going to medical appointments or having elective surgeries, particularly during lockdowns. Some of that staff never returned.\n\nA lack of staff doesn’t just mean long wait times to get a hospital bed. It can threaten patient safety, said Dr. Marcus Schabacker, president and CEO of ECRI, an independent nonprofit focused on health-care safety and technology.\n\nStaffing shortages top the institute’s list of patient safety concerns for 2022.\n\n“The higher the work volume, the higher the stress level, the more likely we’re going to make a mistake,” Schabacker said.\n\nHospitals have tried to put systems in place to catch potential mistakes, “but these redundant systems are stretched too,” he said.\n\nWith pediatric patients, a small mistake could quickly become catastrophic.\n\n“The margin of error in peds is just smaller, right? So their systems are much more fragile,” Schabacker said. “When we talk about medication, their systems, their body system, organ system, just has much less margin for error.”\n\n‘A self-perpetuating shortage’\n\nMany of the experienced nurses working now probably won’t be in the near future. Nearly 20% of RNs are 65 or older, the largest age group in the profession, according to the National Nursing Workforce Study.\n\nA 2019 survey from the US Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast projected that a shortage of registered nurses would spread across the country through 2030.\n\nNursing colleges are not expanding capacity to meet the increased demand as the US population ages and are unlikely to grow enough to replace retiring nurses. In 2019, more than 80,000 qualified applicants were turned away, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n\nOne reason is a lack of instructors. Faculty members are aging out, studies show, and although it requires an advanced degree, teaching often pays less than working as a nurse.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“It’s a self-perpetuating shortage in some ways where, if you don’t have enough nurses to be working the wards, you don’t have capacity for them to be training the next round of nurses,” said Katherine Baicker, an expert on the economic analysis of health policy and dean of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. “And in a world where you’re not actually expanding the supply, you end up with a sort of beggar-thy-neighbor competition for these scarce professionals.”\n\nBaicker thinks technological advances could help. The rise of telemedicine has answered some demand issues, but “it doesn’t solve the problem: that we fundamentally need more supply of nurses and physicians and the whole health-care work force.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/health/children-respiratory-infection-rsv-wellness/index.html", "title": "What to do if your child has a respiratory infection? Our medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA common respiratory virus, respiratory syncytial virus, is surging in the United States, leading to some children’s hospitals being overwhelmed. The influenza virus is also on the rise, along with other viruses — such as adenovirus and rhinovirus — that cause the common cold.\n\nAt the same time, children are back at school and families are returning to many in-person activities, often without the mitigation measures applied during Covid-19, heightening the possibility for viral spread.\n\nThere are two major symptoms that should prompt concern in respiratory infections — difficulty breathing and dehydration, says Dr. Leana Wen. kornnphoto/Adobe Stock\n\nWhat kinds of respiratory infections can be treated at home — and with what treatments? Which symptoms should prompt a call to the doctor, or for parents and caregivers to bring their children to the hospital? When should children stay out of school? And what are the precautions families can take to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nTo help us with these questions and more, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health” and the mother of two young children.\n\nCNN: Why are respiratory infections on the rise?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: They have always been common among children. Before Covid-19, it was the norm, especially during the fall and winter, for schoolkids to have runny noses and coughs.\n\nNow, they may be increasing in part because mitigation measures taken during the pandemic — like social distancing, masking and avoiding large gatherings — resulted in fewer respiratory viruses being spread over the past two winters. As a result, a lot of kids don’t have the immunity they normally would.\n\nMy own kids have already had at least three bouts of respiratory illness each since they started back at kindergarten and preschool less than two months ago. Thankfully, they recovered well and did not get severely ill, but I certainly understand the worry and distress that parents and caregivers feel when our children are sick.\n\nCNN: Which respiratory infections can be dealt with at home?\n\nWen: The vast majority of respiratory infections in children can be managed at home with fluids, fever-reducing medicines and rest. What’s causing the infection is generally not the key determining factor in whether a child needs hospital care — it’s how the child is doing.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, is concerning on a public health level because some hospitals are getting full with children who have it. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that virtually all children will get RSV before their second birthday — and that some 58,000 kids will end up being hospitalized for it every year. Clearly, RSV is a very serious infection among some children, and parents should know what to watch for to spot severe illness. But also keep in mind that the vast majority will have mild, cold-like symptoms and will not need to be hospitalized.\n\nThe same goes for other viruses. Influenza can cause very severe illness, as can Covid-19. However, most cases in children do not result in hospitalization, and symptoms can be managed at home. On the other hand, there are viruses that one typically associates with a mild cold, like adenovirus, that can cause some children to become very sick.\n\nIf you end up going to the emergency department, your child will probably get tested for Covid-19, influenza and RSV. Some pediatricians would do this too. If your child were hospitalized, they might get additional virus testing. But a lot of doctor’s offices wouldn’t provide such care because, again, the actual virus leading to the illness is less important in determining whether your child needs to be hospitalized than how your child is doing.\n\nThe exception is very young infants — generally those under 2 months of age — who are typically tested and monitored more.\n\nCNN: What other risk factors should lead to parents watching for severe illness?\n\nWen: Newborns are very vulnerable. They have little immunity and not much physiological reserve, meaning that once they get sick they could become very ill very quickly. Premature babies are also at risk. Many of them have underdeveloped lungs. A baby born two months premature has a physiological age two months younger than a baby born at term on the same day.\n\nParents and caregivers should have a health plan in place in case their children contract a respiratory virus. Rostislav Sedlacek/Adobe Stock\n\nThere are other factors to consider, too, including for young kids who have significant heart and lung disease, or are severely immunocompromised. In all these situations, families should have a low threshold for calling their physician.\n\nCNN: If a child is generally healthy and develops a fever, cough or runny nose, should parents and caregivers call the doctor? When should they rush to the hospital?\n\nWen: There are two major symptoms that should prompt concern in respiratory infections. The first is breathing difficulties. Look for struggled and fast breathing. For example, if your children are wheezing or grunting; if their nostrils are flaring; if they are belly breathing, meaning that the chest caves in during breathing and the belly goes out; or if their breathing rate is higher than normal.\n\nThe second is difficulty keeping hydrated. This is particularly a problem in babies. If they get stuffed noses, it can be hard for them to drink breastmilk and formula, and they could get dehydrated very quickly. If your child looks sleepy and isn’t drinking, or if your baby is having a decrease in the number of wet diapers, call your doctor sooner rather than later.\n\nOngoing issues — for example, a mild fever that’s been going for a few days — could probably wait for your pediatrician’s office hours.\n\nI’d advise that you have a plan before your child gets sick. A lot of pediatricians have an on-call service where you can reach your doctor or another health care provider within an hour, even at night and on weekends. Know if this possibility exists and have that number easily available to call. If your pediatrician is not reachable after hours, you should know which hospital you’d bring your child to if they were to become seriously ill. Ideally, it’s a hospital close to you and that’s staffed with pediatric emergency medicine specialists.\n\nIf you can’t easily reach your doctor by phone in emergencies, have a low threshold to bring your child to the hospital, especially if you have a newborn or young baby. Breathing difficulties and inability to keep hydrated are good reasons to immediately go to the hospital.\n\nCNN: When should kids stay out of school?\n\nWen: That depends on the policies at your child’s school. Many schools ask that kids stay at home while they have fevers. They also shouldn’t be in attendance if they are throwing up. Some schools may also require Covid-19 testing to make sure that what’s causing the symptoms is not the coronavirus.\n\nThat said, it’s probably not reasonable to ask that kids stay home if they have any hint of the sniffles. That could mean kids miss many weeks of school during winter months. Parents and caregivers should assume there are kids who are infected with some respiratory pathogens in their child’s class at all times and take precautions accordingly. Some families may choose to mask. Others may go back to what they did pre-Covid, which is to stick with good hand hygiene and not being around vulnerable people when sick.\n\nCNN: What types of precautions should parents and caregivers take?\n\nWen: Handwashing is a big one. Many of these respiratory pathogens travel through droplets: When someone sneezes or coughs, those droplets land on surfaces that someone else touches and then touch their nose or mouth. Encourage your kids to wash their hands frequently, and if they need to cough or sneeze, they should do so into their elbow or a tissue to reduce the spread of the droplets.\n\nIf a person in your household has a respiratory infection, it can be easily spread to other household members. You can reduce that risk by not sharing utensils or drinks with the person who is ill, and keeping the person who is sick away from vulnerable household members like newborns and the elderly. In general, families should also limit exposure for newborns and premature babies as much as possible.\n\nThere is no approved vaccine for RSV, but there is for the flu. Parents should get their kids the flu shot. They should get their kids vaccinated against Covid-19 if they haven’t already, and assess their own family circumstances to determine whether they should get their children aged 5 or older the new bivalent booster.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/14/covid-omicron-south-africa-study/6502201001/", "title": "'Spreading at a rate we have not seen' - Omicron more resistant to ...", "text": "The new study from South Africa's largest private health insurer shows that two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is just 33% protective against omicron.\n\nFull vaccination against COVID-19 continues to provide 70% protection against severe disease, according to the Discovery Health study.\n\nOmicron also appears to be able to reinfect people who had an earlier disease variant, with those infected longer ago at higher risk of reinfection.\n\nThe new omicron variant of the coronavirus is substantially more contagious and reduces the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, a study from South Africa released Tuesday found.\n\nEven though the variant so far seems to produce mostly mild disease, world health leaders warned it could bring a wave of illness that crushes health systems\n\n\"Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,\" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We underestimate this virus at our peril,\" he said in a news conference Tuesday from Geneva. \"Even if omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.\"\n\nEarly data from South Africa appears to show that people who are fully vaccinated are still largely protected against severe disease, according to early data released Tuesday by Discovery Health, South Africa's largest private health insurer.\n\nThe omicron variant, which was first identified in southern Africa, appears poised to take over the world, as delta did before it. Omicron accounts for 90% of COVID-19 cases in South Africa and is a growing problem in Europe.\n\nIt has now been found in 77 countries, Ghebreyesus said. It has been seen in at least 30 U.S. states, though the delta variant still dominates the American outbreak.\n\nFormally identified the day before Thanksgiving, information on omicron's characteristics – including how contagious and dangerous it may be – are just emerging.\n\nThe new study from Discovery Health shows that two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which provided more than 90% protection against the original virus, is only 33% protective against omicron infection.\n\nFull vaccination continues to provide 70% protection against severe disease, which seemed to hold up across high-risk groups, though it declined somewhat in people over 60 and even more in those over 70.\n\n\"This is the first time we've had any data on that,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, vice president for research at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, and a national expert on the use of data in medical research.\n\n\"Seventy percent is definitely a dropdown. It isn't great,\" he said. \"It was 95% effective severe disease when it was delta variant and then about 85% after six months of waning,\" he said.\n\nWhether those numbers will continue to hold as more patients with omicron are studied isn't yet clear, he said. \"This is all still so new.\"\n\nOther research from Pfizer-BioNTech suggests that a third, booster dose can restore the original levels of protection at least for some period of time.\n\n“The Omicron-driven fourth (wave) has a significantly steeper trajectory of new infections relative to prior waves,\" Dr, Ryan Noach, CEO of Discovery Health, said in a statement. \"National data show an exponential increase in both new infections and test positivity rates during the first three weeks of this wave, indicating a highly transmissible variant with rapid community spread of infection.”\n\nMild but dangerous\n\nWHO officials chided nations that are focusing on offering boosters to their citizens while ignoring the lack of vaccines globally.\n\n\"The priority in every country and globally must be to protect the least protected, not the most protected,\" Tedros said.\n\nVaccine for poor countries has dealt with many setbacks over the past year, brought on by export restrictions, vaccine hoarding and regulatory delays, COVAX, the global vaccine alliance, said in a statement Tuesday. However, supply has increased since September.\n\nEven if mild, omicron could easily overwhelm health systems even in highly developed nations said Dr. Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.\n\n\"If you have a huge wave of cases, you will see a lot of severity and you will see hospital systems coming under pressure,\" he said.\n\nHe warned already stressed heath systems may fail, and urged they prepare now.\n\n\"Make sure you have the health workers in place, make sure you have the clinical trials in place. Make sure you've got oxygen supplies in place. Make sure that you're vaccinating the unvaccinated,\" Ryan said. \"Make sure you're taking every opportunity individually and at the community level to stop transmission where you can.\"\n\nThe omicron variant is fueling misinformation about COVID: Experts explain why and how to spot false claims.\n\nOmicron appears able to reinfect people who caught an earlier variant of the virus, and those infected longer ago are at higher risk of reinfection.\n\nPeople infected in South Africa's first wave early last year, have a 73% chance of reinfection, while those infected with the beta variant have a 60% chance of reinfection and those infected in its most recent delta wave face a 40% risk of reinfection with omicron, the new study showed.\n\nThat fits with findings from a preliminary briefing released by the United Kingdom on Friday showing an approximately three- to eight-fold increased risk of reinfection with the omicron variant, Topol said.\n\nThere has been some hope that omicron would cause fewer cases of severe disease than its predecessors, but that remains unclear.\n\nThe rate of hospital and intensive care unit admissions is lower than with other variants – 29% lower than with the first wave of infections early last year, according to the study. But that may be because so many South Africans recently recovered from infections with delta, Noach said.\n\nChildren continue to show a relatively low rate of infection with omicron, as they have with earlier variants, the study showed.\n\nChildren infected with omicron have so far had a 20% higher risk of hospital admission for complications than they did with earlier variants, according to Shirley Collie, chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health.\n\n“This is early data and requires careful follow up,\" Collie said in a company press release. But the finding lines up with an earlier warning from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases of an increase in hospital admissions for children under 5.\n\nOmicron is here:How to manage your anxiety about the new variant\n\nAnecdotal reports from South African hospitals suggest that most young children hospitalized with COVID-19 tested positive on routine screening, after going to the hospital for an unrelated reason.\n\n\"It's a peculiarity that hasn't been explained,\" Topol said of the high rate of hospital admissions for children. \"It hasn't yet been seen in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and other places hard hit by omicron.\"\n\nCollie said, “Children were 51% less likely to test positive for COVID19 relative to adults in the Omicron period, and overall, the risk of children being admitted to hospital for COVID19 complications remains low.”\n\nThe world shouldn’t focus only on the early data coming out of South Africa and the United Kingdom showing omicron might be milder, because when omicron gets to different populations it might behave differently, said Dr. Abdirahman Mahamud, WHO COVID-19 incident commander.\n\nEven if omicron does prove to be milder, delta remains a threat.\n\n“We are caught between two elephants, the delta and the omicron,” he said. “These are massive, angry elephants.”\n\nContact Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

RSV\n\nA common respiratory virus known as RSV is spreading at unusually high levels in the US and is overwhelming children’s hospitals. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include a runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing, according to the CDC. But in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and serious illnesses. The CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV as it does for the flu, but it said last week there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with these cases at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Doctor explains what RSV symptoms to look for 01:45 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

The storm also brought the first significant snow of the season to the Rockies over the weekend, a region in need of precipitation to help with ongoing fires and drought conditions.\n\nThis week it will bring rain to much of the country east of the Rockies, reaching the expansive network of rivers that feed into the mighty Mississippi River, which has reached some of its lowest water levels on record.\n\nSoaking rain will be a welcome sight across much of the Plains and Mississippi River Valley. While this one event won’t completely fix the problems along the river, it does signal a possible shift in the weather pattern, which could bring additional rounds of rain in future weeks.\n\nShowers will fire up along a cold front, drawing additional moisture north from the Gulf of Mexico and the remnants of Hurricane Roslyn, which made landfall in Mexico over the weekend.\n\n“Guidance continues to indicate potentially historic early-season snowfall across the eastern UP, which when combined with northerly winds to 50 mph and lingering fall foliage could result in widespread power outages,” the weather service in Marquette warned.\n\n“The forecast shows some potential for training, or repeating rounds of thunderstorms, particularly across eastern Oklahoma, far southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri, and western Arkansas,” explained CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett. “While this rainfall will be welcome due to drought, some locally high amounts of up to six inches could lead to scattered flash flooding.”\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center has issued a slight (Level 2 of 4) risk for excessive rainfall over the region through Tuesday morning.\n\nWidespread rainfall amounts of two to four inches will be likely, and some isolated areas could see up to six.\n\nRain could bring relief to dry riverbeds\n\nThe rain will be beneficial for all the rivers in the country’s midsection, including the Mississippi River, now at record-low levels.\n\nCNN Weather\n\n“We may get some minor temporary rises out of this that may help alleviate a little bit of the conditions that we’re having now, but certainly is not going to be something that will break the low water event that we’re having currently,” said Jeff Graschel, service coordination hydrologist at the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center.\n\nGraschel added the rain could raise the Mississippi River six inches to a foot, but it would only be temporary.\n\nThe Mississippi River near Memphis is five feet below where it needs to be to get out of low water conditions. So, while the rain will only be a drop in the bucket, each soaking rain moving forward will be beneficial.\n\n“Typically, this is the low time and time of year that we have low water on the lower part of the Mississippi River,” Graschel pointed out. “As we get into November, we start getting these frontal boundaries moving across and we start to get more rainfall, especially in the Ohio Valley and typically on the lower part of the Mississippi River.”\n\nWhile conditions on the Mississippi River are unprecedented, Graschel hopes conditions will improve as we enter the wetter months for the Mississippi River Valley.\n\nSevere storms possible this week\n\nStorms will fire up today in Texas, including the cities of Dallas, San Antonio and Austin.\n\n“Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with these storms, although a couple of tornadoes are also possible, mainly tonight,” the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nAs the cold front continues to push eastward Tuesday, the possibility of severe storms will affect parts of the Southeast. Places like Baton Rouge, Memphis, Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery could all see the effects of the storm system. The Storm Prediction Center has placed a Level 2 of 5 risk for severe weather for the area Tuesday.\n\n“If all the moving parts come together tomorrow and allow this severe weather potential to come to fruition, we’ll be looking at a well-organized line of storms with embedded circulations possible,” the weather service in Memphis wrote.\n\nWhile damaging winds will be the primary threat, hail and isolated tornadoes are a possibility.\n\n“The highest tornado potential currently appears to exist from south-central Mississippi northeastward into west-central Alabama,” the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nThe weather service office in Birmingham urged people to be ready.\n\n“Since it’s been a while since we’ve had a tornado threat, now is the time to dust off/test your weather radios and severe weather plans.”\n\nWhile much of the country has been handed a bag of treats from Mother Nature this Halloween, a few semi-spooky spots will still loom as the witches, ghosts and ghouls come out under the Halloween moon.", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/20/death-and-destruction-these-worst-central-pa-weather-related-disasters/423430002/", "title": "Worst weather disasters ever in Pa. have come mostly from flooding", "text": "The 1889 Johnstown Flood killed more people in Pennsylvania than any other weather-related phenomenon, though man was really more responsible than Mother Nature for the deaths there.\n\nBut, over the years, the commonwealth has seen its share of extreme snow, rain and flooding.\n\nHere are some of the worst natural weather disasters to hit Pennsylvania.\n\nHurricane Agnes, June 1972\n\nThere will never be another Hurricane Agnes.\n\nThe destruction of that June 1972 Category 1 hurricane was of such magnitude that the name was retired.\n\nBetween 10 to 14 inches of rain fell over a broad area that included Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nFlooding caused $2 billion in damage in Pennsylvania alone.\n\nIn Elmira, N.Y., 20,000 people were forced out of their homes by rising waters. Those waters flowed south through Pennsylvania, swelling waterways all the way to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nFlooding caused a dike to be breached in Wilkes-Barre resulting in the near destruction of the entire town.\n\nThe Susquehanna River crested at 16 feet above flood stage.\n\nThe storm claimed 128 lives including 50 in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Great Blizzard of 1888, March 1888\n\nMarch 10, 1888, ended an unusual balmy week on the East Coast with temperatures ranging from the 50s to the 70s.\n\nThe next day, snow began to fall. And fall. And fall. And fall.\n\nBy the time the three-day blizzard finished, it had claimed 400 deaths and caused $25 million damage, equivalent to $623 million in today's dollars.\n\nIn what today would be called a bomb cyclone, the blizzard dumped up to 50 inches in Pennsylvania and paralyzed the entire northeast coast.\n\nHurricane Sandy, October 2012\n\nAnother Category 1 hurricane, Sandy moved north out of the tropics and made landfall in New Jersey, northeast of Atlantic City, on Oct. 29, 2012.\n\nThe next day, the storm forced the closure of much of the federal government in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the state emergency management agency attributed 14 deaths to the storm.\n\nAll mass transit and major roadways in and around Philadelphia were forced to close.\n\nMore than 1.3 million commonwealth residents were left without electrical power, necessitating crews and equipment from as far away as Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico to assist in restoring power.\n\nThe storm resulted in 159 deaths, including 87 from hypothermia.\n\nTotal damages topped $71.5 billion.\n\nHurricane Irene, August 2011\n\nHurricane Irene killed five people in Pennsylvania. Three were killed by falling trees, one in a storm-related traffic accident and one was swept away in the Wissahickon Creek, a tributary of the Schuylkill River.\n\nA tropical cyclone, Irene first hit the Caribbean before moving up the east coast all the way to Canada, causing $14.2 billion in damages.\n\nIt made landfall in the U.S. twice, first on Aug. 27, 2011 near Cape Lookout, N.C., and the next day at Little Egg Inlet, N.J.\n\nTropical Storm Lee, September 2011\n\nTwo weeks after Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee wreaked havoc along the eastern seaboard states and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFlooding in September 2011 resulted in 18 deaths, seven in Pennsylvania, and $1.6 to $2 billion in damages.\n\nThe storm forced authorities to call for a mandatory evacuation of Wilkes-Barre and the evacuation of 10,000 Harrisburg residents.\n\nDamages in York County reached $2.9 million.\n\nTropical Storm Allison, June 2001\n\nAlthough never reaching hurricane strength, in June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison caused the worst flooding of Houston, Texas, in history before moving back out over the Gulf, making landfall again in Louisiana and then meandered north through coastal states.\n\nPennsylvania received 10 inches of rain. Hatboro, about 20 miles north of Philadelphia, was the hardest hit state municipality where flood waters rose up to 20 feet, causing a fire in an apartment complex that killed four people.\n\nDamages topped $215 million in Pennsylvania.\n\nBlizzard of 1996, January 1996\n\nOn Jan. 8, 1996, a sudden blizzard swept through the northeast United States, dropping 30 to 36 inches of snow, forcing businesses to close for a week.\n\nYork County was among the hardest hit Pennsylvania area during the January blizzard of 1996.\n\nParts of the county saw up to 40 inches. In Philadelphia, where more than 30 inches of snow fell, authorities resorted to dumping truckloads of snow into the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, which added to the later snowmelt flooding of the city.\n\nGov. Tom Ridge declared a state of emergency and banned all non-emergency vehicles from all roads across the state.\n\nWhile the snow was bad enough, historic flooding on the Susquehanna River followed a couple of weeks later when temperatures warmed into the 50s and heavy rains fell, melting the snow pack.\n\nJohnstown Flood, May 1889\n\nThe Johnstown Flood was a man-made disaster resulting when a heavy rainfall caused the failure of the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River 14 miles upstream from Johnstown.\n\nAs many as 2,209 Johnstown residents, of the total population of 30,000, were killed when the dam broke and released 14.55 million cubic meters -- 3.84 billion gallons of water.\n\nThe dam had held back the man-made reservoir Lake Conemaugh, the centerpiece of the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which included 61 members of the Pittsburgh elite.\n\nA previous owner had removed and scrapped three iron overflow discharge pipes and club members had installed a fish trap that broke and clogged the spillway with debris.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/20"}]}

It is different from Eid al-Fitr, another major Muslim holiday celebrated each year to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan, which ended in early May this year.\n\nEid is a three-day celebration in Muslim-majority countries. But in the United States, it's generally observed on one day.\n\nIn the United States, most Muslims will celebrate Eid al-Adha starting July 9 by visiting mosques and hosting large community gatherings. In other countries, celebrations take place at different times.\n\nWeather:Heat dome to expand, bring hottest temps of the summer to some cities\n\nHere is what to know about the holiday:\n\nWhat is Eid al-Adha?\n\nMohammad Hassan Khalil, a professor of religious studies and director of the Muslim studies program at Michigan State University, said Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic Lunar Calendar.\n\nIt is also celebrated during the annual Holy Pilgrimage of Hajj, in which thousands of Muslims travel to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to worship in the Ka'bah, the most sacred site in Islam.\n\nKhalil says that the day of celebration is determined by the sighting of a new crescent moon at night. If people spot it, this indicates a new month.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nWhat is al-Adha?\n\n“Al-Adha” refers to sacrifice, specifically the “one in which Abraham was asked – as a test – by God to sacrifice his son, only to have God intervene and substitute a ram (or lamb) instead,” said Omid Safi, professor of Islamic studies at Duke University.\n\nThe sacrifice as depicted in the Quran, the Islamic holy text, has similarities to what’s in the Bible, though according to most Muslims, Abraham is asked by God to sacrifice his son Ishmael, not Isaac.\n\nToday, goats, lambs and cows, are sacrificed to mark the occasion. While there are Muslims who engage in this practice in the U.S., Khalil said, some Muslims will work with a company to pay for meat to be distributed in other countries where there is a great need.\n\nThe meat from the animals sacrificed is shared with the community and food banks in areas where there are impoverished or food-insecure Muslims, said Anna Bigelow, associate professor of religious studies at Stanford University.\n\nHow is the holiday celebrated?\n\nCelebrations often include spending time with friends and family, wearing new attire and giving gifts. Khalil says there is usually a big communal religious ceremony or service, which includes a prayer and a sermon.\n\nIn commemorating the story of Abraham, Muslims practice the act of Udhiya (or Qurbani), which involves a sacrifice and distributing meat to the needy and family members.\n\nIn certain countries or regions, there are dishes and special desserts made to celebrate.\n\nA \"Super Eid\" celebration is planned for July 9 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, which will mark the first time the event has been hosted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttendance is expected to eclipse the more than 30,000 people who attended in 2018, which could make it the largest Eid al-Adha celebration in the western hemisphere, Imam Asad Zaman, Executive Director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, told MPR News.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

How will Jewish communities come together this week? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Purim?\n\nPurim is a holiday centered around the biblical Book of Esther, in which Queen Esther stops a plot devised by Haman, the king's counselor, to massacre Jews.\n\n“Jews have celebrated the holiday of Purim as a day when they triumphed over one of their most fearsome enemies named Haman,” Pamela Nadell, a professor of history at American University, told USA TODAY.\n\nBerger said Jewish people continue to “celebrate this day where the tables were turned, where what we thought was going to be the destruction ended up being the salvation of the Jewish people.”\n\nWhat is Tu BiShvat? Everything to know about the Jewish holiday that celebrates nature\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah? Here's what you need to know about the Jewish New Year\n\nHow is Purim celebrated?\n\nThere are four main acts that Jewish people do on the day of Purim, Berger said. The first is to read the story of Esther, called the Megillah.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud, together as a community.\n\n“During the reading, every time the wicked Haman’s name is mentioned, they make a lot of noise,” Nadell said, explaining that people will stomp their feet, shout and use a grogger, a kind of noisemaker.\n\nOther traditions include having festive meals, bringing food to loved ones and giving charitable gifts.\n\n“It's also very important on the holiday to also make donations, to give charity,” Nadell said. “You have this wonderful, raucous celebration, and then you also have remembering those who are less fortunate.”\n\nBerger added that the tradition of giving charitable gifts “is a recognition that we can't sit here in joy and in the levity of the moment if we're not also taking care of those who are in need.”\n\nHe also pointed to commemorations that individual groups organize for Purim. For example, this year, \"Hillel International is urging Jewish students and the global Jewish community to abstain from food and donate what they would have spent on meals” to relief efforts in Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, according to a news release from the organization. The show of support comes from an ancient tradition to fast ahead of Purim.\n\nSome groups of Jewish people will also bake and eat hamantaschen, a cookie named after the villain Haman, among other Purim celebrations.\n\nIs Purim like Halloween?\n\nThough experts told USA TODAY some Jews don’t embrace comparing the holiday to Halloween, Purim is often likened to modern Halloween celebrations because both involve dressing up in costumes and going to carnivals and other festivities.\n\n“You can think of Purim as the Jewish Halloween,” Nadell said. “Jews wear all sorts of fanciful costumes, and they dress up. Little girls will dress up as Queen Esther, and boys will dress up as one of the male heroes of the story, he was Esther's uncle, his name was Mordechai.”\n\nBut she added that children – and some adults – will “dress up in all sorts of things.”\n\n“Honestly, I've even seen people dress their pets up in costumes, just like they do on Halloween,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/18/rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur-jewish-holidays/5643430002/", "title": "Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur: What to know about these Jewish ...", "text": "Rosh Hashanah. Yom Kippur.\n\nThey’re two of the most familiar – and important – days on the Jewish religious calendar, but did you know that the two events are strongly connected? And what these special days actually represent?\n\nFor some, Rosh Hashanah is called the “birthday of the world.\" It marks the start of the Jewish New Year, and is filled with shared meals and prayer among loved ones. The celebration also begins the Jewish High Holy Days leading up to Yom Kippur – and a time when Jews focus their attention on repentance and reflection of action.\n\nHere’s what to know about these holy days:\n\nWhen are Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in 2020?\n\nThis year, Rosh Hashanah begins at sunset on Friday, Sept. 18, and ends two days later at sunset on Sunday, Sept. 20. It’s the start of the Jewish month of Tishrei, or Tishri, which falls in September or October, according to the Gregorian calendar. It’s the first month of the civil year for Jews or the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. Some years, Rosh Hashanah can start in early September or as late as early October.\n\nYom Kippur will begin in the following week – on the evening of Sunday, Sept. 27, and end the evening of Monday, Sept. 28.\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah?\n\nIt marks the start of the Jewish New Year, as stated in the Bible (Leviticus 23:23-31).\n\nWhile some ancient cultures, such as the Celts, celebrated the start of a new year during the spring equinox because it was the time of planting, Semitic cultures in the Near East celebrated the new year in the fall, after the harvest was gathered. The name of Rosh Hashanah can be translated as “first” or “head of the year.” It is also sometimes called “The Feast of Trumpets.”\n\nAlso, Rosh Hashanah marks the start of the Jewish High Holy Days leading up to Yom Kippur. It marks the beginning of the 10 “Days of Awe,” in which Jews focus their attentions on repentance and reflection leading up to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, considered to be holiest day of the Jewish year. Traditionally, the blood of an animal was sacrificed as a way to remove sin or defilement.\n\nAccording to tradition, the names of the righteous are written in the Book of Life and names of the wicked are written in the Book of Death. For everyone else – most people – you have 10 days to repent before your fate is sealed in one of the two books.\n\nWhy does it last for two days?\n\nReligious holidays normally last for one day. But not Rosh Hashanah.\n\nIt’s actually called yoma arichta – translated as “a long day” – because the 48-hour period when Rosh Hashanah is observed is actually considered to be one extended day. It’s the only Jewish holiday that is two days long both outside and inside Israel.\n\nAncient Jews relied on a calendar based on actual cycles of the moon, not one arbitrarily set. Thus, the key to determining the first day of each month was the sighting of the new moon. It was so important that it required confirmation by two or more witnesses.\n\nBecause of difficulties in determining the new moon (it could be obscured by clouds, etc.) and the slowness with which news once traveled Jewish leaders living outside Israel decided Rosh Hashanah would be celebrated over two days to ensure it was celebrated on the appropriate day. Jewish leaders inside Israel had less difficulty determining the start of the holiday – but still celebrate it over two days for consistency.\n\nHow is Rosh Hashanah celebrated?\n\nUnlike the festive celebrations of New Year in other faiths, the Jewish New Year is a time of reflection on one’s actions of the past year and sincere repentance for those sins.\n\nHowever, it also is a time to share meals and prayer with family and friends. That includes special treats such as apples or challah bread dipped in honey (to symbolize one’s wish for a sweet new year to come); prayer services and Torah readings on both mornings of Rosh Hashanah that include repeated blasts from a ram’s horn, called a shofar; and the lighting of candles in the evenings with appropriate blessings.\n\nThe shofar signifies the presence of God and is a powerful symbol of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son, Isaac, to show obedience to God by reminding us of the ram that was provided in Isaac’s place.\n\nSpecial food also is eaten during Rosh Hashanah.\n\nThat may include pomegranate fruit, as people wish for blessings in the new year as plentiful as the seeds of a pomegranate. The pomegranate’s 613 seeds also symbolize the 613 “mitzvot,”or commandments, in the Torah.\n\nRound challah bread baked with raisins inside is also popular during the holiday.\n\nSome people also will traditionally eat the head of a fish or a ram to symbolize the “head of the year.” Fish is also eaten because it is a symbol of fertility and abundance.\n\nWhy are prayers said next to a body of water during Rosh Hashanah?\n\nOn the first day of Rosh Hashanah, Jews may be seen praying near a body of water, such as a lake, river or sea while performing the Tashlich ceremony.\n\nTraditionally, pieces of break or other food are tossed into the water to symbolize the “casting off” of sins. Just as the food is carried away, so are one’s sins.\n\nThe practice, which began in the Middle Ages, was inspired by a verse from the prophet Micah (Micah: 7:19):\n\nGod will take us back in love God will cover up our iniquities You (God) will hurl all our sins Into the depths of the sea.\n\nCan you work on Rosh Hashanah?\n\nRosh Hashanah is meant to be a day of rest, not labor. The Torah expressly forbids one to do any work on Rosh Hashanah, as well as other major Jewish holy days.\n\nThe religious laws governing behavior on Rosh Hashanah can be complex.\n\nIt is permissible to cook on Rosh Hashanah, although there are certain important restrictions. Carrying items is also permitted – if the items are required for the holiday.\n\nOrthodox Jews prohibit driving on the holiday. Reform and more liberal-minded Jews do not object to driving on the holiday. Orthodox Jews also forbid the lighting of a stove from scratch, although adjusting an existing flame on a stove is OK. That's why Orthodox Jews will keep a candle burning for 24 hours a day during Rosh Hashanah.\n\nWhat are Rosh Hashanah greetings?\n\nIf you’re not sure how to greet someone on Rosh Hashanah, you could just say “Shanah Tovah,” which means “good year” in Hebrew. The word “u’metuka” – meaning “and sweet” – is sometimes added to the end of that phrase as in “good and sweet year.”\n\nA version of this story was originally published in 2019.\n\nFollow Dwight Adams on Twitter: @hdwightadams.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/30/eid-al-fitr-2022-muslim-holiday-ramadan/7440332001/", "title": "Eid al-Fitr 2022: What to know about the Muslim holiday after ...", "text": "This year Eid al-Fitr starts on May 1 or May 2, depending on the lunar calendar.\n\nThe start of the holiday is timed to the first sighting of the crescent moon marking the beginning of the Islamic month of Shawwal.\n\nSome countries, such as Turkey, rely on technology to see the crescent moon. Others, still follow the tradition of sticking to bare eyes to see the moon's shape.\n\nEid al-Fitr is celebrated to commemorate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and takes place over three days. Eid al-Fitr means “the celebration of breaking the fast.”\n\nRamadan marks the time when the Quran, the Muslim holy book, was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Devout Muslims fast during daylight hours and spend time in self-reflection, prayer and giving charity.\n\nThere are two Eids celebrated in the year: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.\n\nEid al-Adha, or \"feast of the sacrifice,\" celebrated this year from July 9-10, marks the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son to Allah. In Christianity and Judaism, this is told as the story of Abraham and his son Isaac.\n\nFor Eid, the end of Ramadan all LGBTQ Muslims want is acceptance, acknowledgment\n\nThis is America:Ramadan brings blessings of loved ones, community togetherness\n\nWhat is Eid al-Fitr?\n\nEid al-Fitr marks the first day on which Muslims return to their regular lifestyles and stop the daytime fasting required during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\"God has given us that one special day for us to celebrate our ability to get through that one month,\" Khalid Mozaffar, director of communications and outreach at the American Islamic Association in Frankfort, Illinois, told USA TODAY.\n\nOne of the traditions of Eid includes donating charity, called zakat, one of the pillars of Islam. Muslims are obligated to pay zakat yearly toward feeding and helping those in need.\n\nAhead of the day of Eid, before the morning prayer at the latest, there's a special charity required called zakat al-Fitr. The exact amount differs according to the state of the economy. The donations help people celebrate Eid no matter their financial situation, Tareq Alkhudari, a Kuwaiti human rights activist, told USA TODAY.\n\nHow is Eid celebrated?\n\nOn Eid, Muslims traditionally have a light breakfast and then head to the mosque for a special prayer and a sermon, according to Mozaffar.\n\nAfter praying, Muslim families gather and exchange gifts. Traditional dishes and sweets are also made and exchanged.\n\n\"If you visit different families, you're gonna get fed a lot,\" said Mozaffar.\n\nDuring this celebration, some Muslims volunteer at soup kitchens or food pantries, according to Mozaffar, to help those less fortunate.\n\nLooking for Ramadan recipe inspiration?These dishes use dates to sweet-savory effect\n\nCelebrating in the US\n\nAlkhudari and Mozaffar expressed their frustration that Eid al-Fitr doesn't get more attention in the U.S., even though Muslims make up more than 1% of the population.\n\nIn Islamic countries, people usually get all three days of the celebration off from work.

However, there is one Jewish holiday that can be observed during a pandemic with surprisingly little adjustment.\n\nSukkot, the week-long fall harvest festival which started Friday evening, has been honored outside for thousands of years. The primary way to celebrate: To build and dwell in a man-made hut called a “sukkah.”\n\nAlthough the holiday has long been overshadowed by the Jewish high holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the “symbolism of the sukkah this year feels particularly rife,” says Rabbi Andrea London of Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSo what is Sukkot and what makes it special this year? Let’s take a look:\n\nWhat is Sukkot all about?\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Israelites' nomadic life in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt.\n\n“We were wandering for 40 years, we were in temporary shelters and we built temporary huts,” says Becky Sobelman-Stern, the chief program officer at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\n\nIt is also an agricultural holiday connected to the fall harvest.\n\n“This is really the Jewish Thanksgiving,” adds London. She says it's a time to be thankful for our food and and pray for rain to bring a good harvest next year.\n\nAlready dining outdoors? On Sukkot, you're supposed to eat in a sukkah (hut)\n\nObservant Jews make sukkot (that's the plural of sukkah and also the holiday name) out of materials found in nature — Sobelman-Stern uses palms found in her yard — and sometimes with the help of sukkah kits that can have steel tubing and wooden panels. The sukkah is supposed to have three walls and a roof that provides shade but also allows guests to see through it to the stars.\n\nThe sukkah is meant to be a place for outdoor dining. It is also customary to sleep in the sukkah all week, though “not everyone does the sleeping part, especially here in Chicago,” London says.\n\nPeople who don’t have the space or ability to erect a temporary hut outside can use porticos and overhangs to get into the spirit of the holiday. The holiday “is outside. It’s about decorating. It’s about being creative,” Sobelman-Stern says.\n\nWhy Sukkot feels more meaningful this year\n\nWith the holiday encouraging Jewish people to eat and socialize in open outdoor structures, “in some ways, Sukkot seems made for COVID world,” says Rabbi Sarah Krinsky of Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C.\n\n“It does go deeper than that, too, though: Sukkot is about recognizing the places of fragility in our lives. It reminds us of what is temporary,\" she says.\n\nThe holiday also serves as a reminder of what’s important in life, London adds. “And how do we pursue those things? How do we be people who live with compassion and justice? How can our faith in God support us in times of trials and tribulations in crisis?”\n\nSukkot is meant to inspire thought and discussion around those questions, and also this one: “Who else, deceased or alive, would you like to have in the sukkah this year?”\n\nOn Sobelman-Stern’s list is the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at the start of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nIt's a Jewish holiday that requires joy\n\nSukkot is the only Jewish holiday in which there is a commanded emotion, Krinsky explains. “In this case, profound joy,” she says.\n\nStepping outside, enjoying nature, decorating a sukkah and sharing food with friends (though likely fewer this year than on any other year, because of the threat of COVID-19) is meant to \"lead us to a deeper sense of presence, gratitude and even joy,\" says Krinsky. Finding joy on the holiday feels particularly important this year, she says, when doing so can be feel like a \"profound challenge and opportunity.\"\n\nAnd if the aforementioned activities don’t put a smile on your face, one specific tradition should: The shaking of the lulav and etrog.\n\nThe lulav, which is meant to symbolize the body, is made from binding the frond of a palm tree to myrtle and willow branches. The etrog, which is meant to symbolize the heart, is a citron fruit that looks like a large lemon. Both are shaken in all directions as a way to recognize God’s presence.

UK residents aged 8 and over will be invited to create a recipe and the finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, Monica Galetti and the Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan.\n\nThe winning recipe will then be made available to the public ahead of the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOther events planned to mark the occasion include the “BBC Platinum Party at the Palace” – a live concert which promises to bring together some of the world’s biggest entertainment stars to celebrate significant moments from the Queen’s reign.\n\nOn Thursday June 2, more than 1,500 towns, villages and cities throughout the UK and its overseas territories will light a beacon to mark the Jubilee. The capitals of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons – even as sentiment towards the British monarch in the Commonwealth now differs throughout different nations.\n\nThe Jubilee Weekend celebrations will also see “Big Jubilee Lunches” take place across Britain, including flagship events in London and at Cornwall’s Eden Project – where the idea for the lunches originated.\n\nA Platinum Jubilee Pageant will also be held, in which artistic performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers will unite to tell the story of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in a festival of creativity. It will take place in London and will include street arts, theater, music, circus, costumes, and visual technology.\n\nThis pageant will involve a “River of Hope” section that will comprise 200 silk flags that will process down The Mall – the road in London that leads to Buckingham Palace – like a river. School children are invited to create a picture of their hopes and aspirations for the planet over the next 70 years.\n\nThe artwork for the flags will be focused on climate change and incorporate the children’s messages for the future.\n\nThe pageant will take place on June 5, the last day of the Platinum Jubilee Weekend celebrations, as the events marking the monarch’s historic 70-year reign draw to a close.\n\nCNN has launched Royal News, a new weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.

How is the Muslim festival celebrated?", "text": "This week, millions of Muslims worldwide will celebrate Eid al-Adha, an Islamic religious festival commemorating Prophet Abraham's faithfulness to God after being tested with the unfulfilled command to sacrifice his son.\n\nThe holiday also marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage. It is different from another major Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr, which was recently celebrated in May to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nDepending on the country, celebrations will take place at different times. In the United States, most Muslims will be celebrating Eid al-Adha on the evening of July 19.\n\nEid is a three-day celebration in Muslim-majority countries. In the United States, most people observe just one day.\n\nUnder usual circumstances, Muslims would visit mosques and have large community gatherings. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, celebrations are looking a bit different this year.\n\nHere is what to know about the holiday:\n\nWhat is Eid al-Adha?\n\nAccording to Mohammad Hassan Khalil, a professor of religious studies and director of the Muslim studies program at Michigan State University, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic Lunar Calendar.\n\nIt is also celebrated during the annual Holy Pilgrimage of Hajj, in which thousands of Muslims travel to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to worship in the Ka'bah, the most sacred site in Islam.\n\nKhalil says that the day of celebration is determined by the sighting of a new crescent moon at night. If people spot it, this indicates a new month.\n\n\"Since this holiday overlaps with the pilgrimage or the Hajj to Mecca, which takes place in Saudi Arabia, many people will look to Saudi Arabia to determine the timing of this holiday,\" Khalil told USA TODAY. \"In Saudi Arabia, there will usually be a select group of people looking for the new moon.\"\n\nThe day of celebration varies for different countries and even communities. In the United States, most celebrations will begin the evening of July 19.\n\nThe meaning of 'al-Adha'\n\n“Al-Adha” refers to sacrifice, specifically the “one in which Abraham was asked – as a test – by God to sacrifice his son, only to have God intervene and substitute a ram (or lamb) instead,” Omid Safi, professor of Islamic studies at Duke University, said.\n\nThe sacrifice as depicted in the Quran (the Islamic holy text) has similarities to what’s in the Bible, though according to most Muslims, Abraham is asked by God to sacrifice his son Ishmael, not Isaac.\n\nMuslims to Biden: Fighting Islamophobia requires more than lifting Trump's travel ban\n\nMore: Muslims around the world celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan\n\nIn present-day, animals, typically goats, lambs or cows, are still sacrificed to mark the occasion. Khalil says that while there are Muslims who engage in this practice in the U.S., some Muslims will work with a company to pay for meat to be distributed in other countries where there is a great need.\n\nThe meat from the animals sacrificed is shared with the community and food banks in areas where there are impoverished or food-insecure Muslims, said Anna Bigelow, associate professor of religious studies at Stanford University.\n\nSafi said for many poor Muslims, Eid al-Adha marks an occasion where they receive meat.\n\nHe added, “Since the notion of sacrifice initially referred to sacrificing that which is precious (thus the test of offering one’s child to God), there is a longstanding Muslim tradition of taking the sacrifice at the symbolic level, implying that the real sacrifice is not the killing of an animal, but rather sacrificing one’s own egoistical desires.”\n\nHow will Eid al-Adha be celebrated this year?\n\nCelebrations normally include spending time with friends and family, wearing new attire and giving gifts. Khalil says there is usually a big communal religious ceremony or service, which includes a prayer and a sermon. In the age of COVID-19, there are exceptions.\n\n\"Each community is different. Some communities may cancel the prayer, some may hold it outdoors with social distancing, while others may hold it indoors, and so on,\" Khalil said.\n\nIn commemorating the story of Abraham, Muslims will practice the act of Udhiya (or Qurbani), which involves a sacrifice and distributing the meat to the needy and to family members.\n\nIn certain countries or regions, there are dishes that are made to celebrate the holiday.\n\n\"During this time, there are special desserts that are made in Egypt, which is where my family is from.

During the two-day celebration, your Jewish friends or coworkers might take time away from work to attend synagogue, eat foods such as apples and honey or say prayers near a body of water.\n\nBut why is Rosh Hashanah important? And what do traditions like eating a round challah mean for Jewish communities? Here’s what you need to know about Rosh Hashanah celebrations:\n\nWhy is Rosh Hashanah important?\n\nRosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days that lead up to Yom Kippur, the most sacred day for Jewish people.\n\nThe celebration of the new year marks the beginning of the 10 “Days of Awe,” a time when Jews reflect and repent ahead of Yom Kippur.\n\nSamira Mehta, the director of undergraduate studies in the program for Jewish studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, explained to USA TODAY that the “Book of Life,” which symbolizes how Jewish people will be judged for the coming year, \"opens\" on Rosh Hashanah and is “sealed” on Yom Kippur.\n\n“Rosh Hashanah sort of opens the period of intense retrospection that leads up to that moment of atonement,” Mehta said. “But it's also a joyous holiday in which people celebrate and hope for a sweet new year, a happier, an enriching New Year.”\n\nRabbi Charlie Schwartz, senior director of Jewish education at Hillel International, called Rosh Hashanah “a time of reflection and reset and reevaluation.”\n\n“It's a time to reflect and evaluate, and to think about what you want to do differently and what you want to achieve in the upcoming year,” Schwartz said.\n\nWhen is Rosh Hashanah?\n\nRosh Hashanah starts at sunset on Monday, and it continues through sunset on Wednesday.\n\nRosh Hashanah is the only Jewish holiday that is two days long both outside and inside of Israel. The celebration is called yoma arichta, translated as “a long day,” because the 48-hour holiday is considered to be one extended day.\n\nTip: If you want to greet a Jewish friend or family member on Rosh Hashanah, you could say “Shanah Tovah,” which means “good year” in Hebrew.\n\nReviewed:Everything you need to celebrate Rosh Hashanah in style\n\nWhat is Shavuot?:Everything to know about the Jewish holiday\n\nHow do Jews celebrate Rosh Hashanah?\n\nJewish communities around the world have embraced different celebrations for Rosh Hashanah.\n\nSome of the most common celebrations for Jews in the United States include eating apples and honey, which is meant to usher in a sweet new year.\n\nOthers eat challah, a braided bread, in a round loaf to represent the cycle of the year. Pomegranate seeds are also eaten to represent the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, in the Torah, the Jewish holy book.\n\n“There’s a great custom of having symbolic foods that are symbolic of what we’re hoping for in the coming year,” Schwartz said.\n\nSome Jews may also recite prayers near a body of water during a Tashlich ceremony, in addition to tossing pieces of bread or other food into the water to symbolize “casting off” sins.\n\nSynagogues will also blow a shofar, a curved ram's horn, during Rosh Hashanah.\n\nThere are many interpretations of the shofar’s meaning. One is that it represents the biblical story told in Genesis, in which Abraham sacrifices a ram instead of his son, Isaac.\n\nRabbis have also interpreted the loud blast of the shofar as a wake-up call for the new year. Schwartz called the sounding of the shofar “the pinnacle of the Rosh Hashanah service in synagogues.”\n\n“It's an ancient sound that kind of transports you back to the whole expanse of Jewish history. It’s supposed to awaken us to the possibility of transformation,” he said.\n\nHow will the pandemic change Rosh Hashanah celebrations this year?\n\nSynagogues across the country are taking different approaches to holding services for Rosh Hashanah during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome synagogues will hold services in person with no vaccine mandate, while others might ask members to be vaccinated or test negative for COVID-19. Other temples will hold services virtually or outside and socially distanced.\n\nMehta noted that some communities are struggling with how to include children under the age of 12 who cannot be vaccinated, citing the Jewish concept of “l’dor v’dor,” which means passing traditions from generation to generation.\n\n“The idea of putting unvaccinated children at risk is very troubling to these communities, but also the idea of excluding them,” Mehta said. “How do you make a service meaningful for children? Can it be done over Zoom? Can it be done outside?\"\n\nSchwartz said that some synagogues, Jewish communities on college and university campuses and other groups are “trying to be as flexible as possible” with implementing safety precautions for services.\n\n“The High Holidays are an opportunity to think hard about who we want to be and how we want to be in the world,” he said. “And I think at this moment in the pandemic, as we're starting to reemerge, starting to think about like what the world might look like in the future, it's a perfect time to think ‘OK, so here are the things that we've learned. Here’s how we want to change.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/05/13/shavuot-what-jewish-holiday-when-it-why-all-dairy/5061642001/", "title": "Shavuot: What is the Jewish holiday? When is it? Why all the dairy?", "text": "When you think of Jewish holidays, a few may come to mind. Hanukkah, Passover, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, maybe. But what about Shavuot?\n\nThe holiday – which means \"weeks\" in Hebrew, and is referred to as the \"Feast of Weeks\" – celebrates the Jews receiving the Torah (the Jewish bible) from God on Mount Sinai; it is the end of a seven-week (49-day) count called the Omer that starts during Passover, the holiday where Jews partake in seders and remember how they were freed from Egyptian slavery.\n\nWhat is Shavuot?\n\nWhile some people may not be familiar with the holiday, it's a significant one for Jews, explains Rabbi Motti Seligson, the director of media relations at Chabad.org.\n\nShavuot coincides with the grain harvest of early summer and is one of three pilgrimage festivals mentioned in the Torah. The other two are Passover and Sukkot. The grain harvest \"was one of the three pilgrimage festivals of ancient Israel, when Israelite males were commanded to appear before God in Jerusalem, bringing offerings of the first fruits of their harvest,\" according to MyJewishLearning.com.\n\nJews who observe the holiday of Shavuot typically self-reflect during the 49-day \"Omer count\" period and work on their spiritual growth.\n\nIn case you missed:Conversational chaos, prayers and hope: My Passover seder on Zoom in the time of coronavirus\n\nWhen is Shavuot?\n\nThis year, it begins the evening of Saturday, June 4 and lasts until the evening of Monday, June 6. It always falls on the Hebrew calendar 6 Sivan through 7 Sivan.\n\nThe Hebrew and Gregorian calendars do not match up, so dates will vary each year in the U.S.\n\nHow is Shavuot celebrated? And why is it traditional to eat dairy on Shavuot?\n\nNot all Jews observe each holiday the same way. \"People have different levels of observance,\" Seligson says. \"The most observed Jewish holiday in United States is Passover.\"\n\nStill, Shavuot is a special holiday, Seligson says, and the main way of marking it is hearing the reading of the Ten Commandments from a Torah scroll.\n\nTraditions also include staying up all night studying Torah and eating dairy.\n\n\"The morning of receiving the Torah, (the Jews) slept in, and in making up for that, we stay up all night, studying the Torah the first night of Shavuot, and really proving our worthiness and excitement and enthusiasm towards the Torah,\" Seligson says.\n\nThe dairy component sets Shavuot apart from other Jewish holidays where meat traditionally takes center stage.\n\nOn Shavout, typical dishes include stuffed blintzes and cheesecake. There's a debate on the origins of why this food group is associated with the holiday. Some say the tradition is derived from directions in scripture and others say it came about because dairy was plentiful during spring harvests, according to MyJewishLearning.com.\n\nOther customs include reading from the book of Ruth and adorning synagogues with fresh flowers, \"in the spirit of how Mount Sinai miraculously bloomed just before the giving of the Torah,\" Seligson says.\n\nSeligson's favorite part of the holiday is its emphasis on togetherness. \"For me, it's really gathering with community to hear the 10 commandments, because the holiday really is about unity,\" he says. \"When the Jews were gathered at Mount Sinai there was a very strong sense of unity.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}]}

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/world/gallery/photos-this-week-october-20-october-27/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: October 20-27, 2022 | CNN", "text": "Britain's King Charles III welcomes Rishi Sunak to Buckingham Palace in London on Tuesday, October 25.

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/uk-new-prime-minister-political-crisis-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Rishi Sunak front-runner to be Britain's new prime minister after ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain’s former finance minister Rishi Sunak has emerged as the front-runner to be the country’s next prime minister, after Boris Johnson dramatically dropped out of the race to be Conservative Party leader.\n\nThe current prime minister, Liz Truss, resigned last week after just six disastrous weeks in office. Graham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the leadership contest, said a new prime minister would be in place by Friday.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss have until 2 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) on Monday to secure the support of 100 Conservative Party lawmakers to enter the race to become the party – and the country’s – new leader.\n\nJohnson’s decision to withdraw from the contest leaves Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, competing against Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt.\n\nIf both candidates secure the backing of 100 MPs, it will then be up to the roughly 172,000 members of the Conservative Party to pick the new leader in online voting.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Sunak was the only one of the pair to have met the necessary threshold of 100 nominations.\n\nIf Sunak remains the only one to have reached this number of backers, he will automatically become the Conservative Party’s new leader. The party’s parliamentary majority ensures he will also become the country’s next prime minister.\n\nBoris Johnson's withdrawal from the race leaves Rishi Sunak (L) and Penny Mordaunt (R) as the remaining contenders. Getty Images/AP\n\nAfter days of speculation, Sunak officially declared he’d be standing in the contest on Sunday, writing on Twitter: “The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis. That’s why I am standing to be Leader of the Conservative Party and your next Prime Minister. I want to fix our economy, unite our Party and deliver for our country.\n\n“There will be integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level of the government I lead and I will work day in and day out to get the job done.”\n\nMany of Johnson’s supporters have blamed Sunak for helping to oust Johnson from power in July in the wake of a series of scandals, but on Sunday evening he paid tribute to the former PM after he pulled out of the race.\n\n“Boris Johnson delivered Brexit and the great vaccine roll-out. He led our country through some of the toughest challenges we have ever faced, and then took on Putin and his barbaric war in Ukraine. We will always be grateful to him for that,” Sunak tweeted. “Although he has decided not to run for PM again, I truly hope he continues to contribute to public life at home and abroad.”\n\nIn his statement announcing his withdrawal from the race, Johnson claimed to have secured the nominations of 102 MPs, even though the number of lawmakers who had publicly announced their support for him was much lower. And he took a swipe at Sunak and Truss after failing to convince them to support his comeback.\n\n“There is a very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative Party members - and that I could indeed be back in Downing Street on Friday,” Johnson said. “But in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do. You can’t govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.”\n\n“And though I have reached out to both Rishi (Sunak) and Penny (Mordaunt) – because I hoped that we could come together in the national interest – we have sadly not been able to work out a way of doing this,” he added. “Therefore I am afraid the best thing is that I do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds. I believe I have much to offer but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time.”\n\nMordaunt was the first to declare her candidacy on Friday. She promised a “fresh start” for the UK, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.” She is also running under a catchy hashtag: “PM4PM.”\n\nShe too praised Johnson for his decision to withdraw from the contest, saying the former PM “put country before party, and party before self.”\n\n“He worked to secure the mandate and the majority we now enjoy. We should put it to good use, and I know he will work with us to do so,” she said on Twitter.\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the new threshold, and to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nThe last time the Conservatives held a leadership race – following the demise of Johnson’s government – Truss came first, Sunak second and Mordaunt third. Johnson did not run.\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, renewed his calls for a general election on Sunday, after claiming people were “fed up to the back teeth” with the Conservative leadership and the consequences of their government’s decisions.\n\n“There is a choice to be made. We need a general election! Let the public decide … Do they want to continue with this utter chaos, or do they want stability under a Labour government?” Starmer asked during a BBC interview.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/rishi-sunak-uk-prime-minister-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Rishi Sunak will be Britain's next prime minister after seeing off rivals ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFormer finance minister Rishi Sunak will be the United Kingdom’s next prime minister after seeing off his lone remaining rival in the fast-tracked race to become Conservative party leader on Monday.\n\nThe other potential candidate, Penny Mordaunt, conceded after failing to meet the threshold of nominations from lawmakers required to progress to the next stage of the race. Moments before the number of nominations were due to be announced, Mordaunt pledged her full support to Sunak.\n\nSunak will become the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead the UK. At 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement, Sunak said he was “humbled and honored” to have been elected leader. “It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love and give back to the country I owe so much to,” he said in a brief televised statement.\n\nSunak is set to replace Liz Truss, who will become the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history. Sunak will become prime minister on Tuesday once he is officially appointed by King Charles III and will be the first prime minister appointed by the new King following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September.\n\nCNN understood that the King was traveling to London from the private royal estate of Sandringham on Monday afternoon, as had always been his plan. He will have an audience with Truss on Tuesday morning before meeting with Sunak.\n\nSunak’s rise is a historic moment for Britain’s South Asian community, said Sanjay Chandarana, who heads a Hindu temple co-founded by Sunak’s grandparents in 1971.\n\n“It’s a Barack Obama moment for us. A South Asian, Indian origin prime minister in the UK. Everyone here is so thrilled to hear that news,” Chandarana, the president of the Vedic Society Hindu Temple in Southampton, told CNN.\n\nSunak’s grandparents were born in India and his parents emigrated to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s. Sunak has spoken publicly about his British Indian heritage, telling the Business Standard in a 2015 interview that he ticks British Indian on the census.\n\n“I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak told Business Standard.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday offered his “warmest congratulations” to Sunak, calling the incoming Prime Minister a bridge between both countries.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” Modi said on Twitter.\n\nTruss also congratulated Sunak following the announcement, saying on Twitter that he has her “full support.”\n\nSunak officially declared he’d be standing on Sunday after securing the support of 100 Conservative lawmakers, the necessary threshold set by party officials. By Monday he had secured the support of more than half of the party’s 357 MPs.\n\nHis campaign got a big boost when his former boss and rival, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, withdrew from the race on Sunday night.\n\nMonday marks the pinnacle of what has been an astonishingly quick rise to power for Sunak. He was first elected into Parliament in 2015 and became a junior minister in 2017. It was Johnson who gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nBut as Britain’s third prime minister in seven weeks, Sunak is facing an enormous task.\n\nHis own party is divided and increasingly unpopular following four months of political turmoil and financial market chaos. At the same time, Britain is facing major economic crisis, with many economists believing it is already in recession.\n\nHe is also already under intense fire from opposition politicians.\n\nGeneral election calls\n\nSunak, like Truss, has not had to win a general election to become prime minister because the Conservatives are still the largest party in the House of Commons, therefore their leader automatically becomes prime minister.\n\nThe deputy leader of the opposition Labour party, Angela Rayner, said Sunak had “no mandate and no idea what working people need” and called for an early election.\n\n“We need a general election so the public get a say on the future of Britain – and the chance for a fresh start with Labour,” she said.\n\nIt’s not unusual for a prime minister to come into office without an election – four of the last five British prime ministers first entered the role without a general election. But the fact that Sunak is the UK’s third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote adds to the pressure.\n\nSunak is under no obligation to call a vote. According to the law, the next general election must happen no later than in January 2025. With Labour way ahead in opinion polls, it is very unlikely he will take that step.\n\nScottish leader Nicola Sturgeon also criticized the way Sunak came to power and renewed her call for Scottish independence.\n\n“For Scotland, of course, he becomes another PM we did not and, without doubt would not vote for even if given the chance. To escape the damage of Westminster governments with no mandate here, and take our future into our own hands, Scotland needs independence,” Sturgeon said.\n\n‘Profound economic challenge’\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak said during the statement on Monday afternoon.\n\n“We now need stability and unity and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together. Because that is the only way we will overcome the challenges we face and build a better, more prosperous future for our children and our grandchildren,” he added.\n\nAs a former chancellor, Sunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting. He guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, putting in place a giant financial stimulus package.\n\nWhile he has not given any details on his planned policies in the past few days, he positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate when he ran against Truss in the previous Conservative leadership contest over the summer.\n\nHe was seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. While he agreed with Truss that taxes should be lower, he said any cuts could only happen once inflation was brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHe criticized Truss’ economic plan which ultimately sparked panic in the financial markets and led to her demise. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nInvestors appeared to welcome Sunak’s ascent to power.

Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election – securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid. The former attorney-general has not run before – but with her hard-line stance on immigration, might look set to drag the party further to the right.\n\nTom Tugendhat emerged as a surprise favorite among Tory members and the wider public, despite only coming fifth in the last leadership election. Having not served as a cabinet member before that contest, Tugendhat distanced himself from the moral mess of Johnson’s government and promised a “clean start” for Britain. After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tugendhat was made security minister by Truss.\n\nBen Wallace, defense secretary and another ex-military man, was tipped to succeed Johnson in the last leadership contest – polling extremely well among Conservative members. However, he never ran in that election, and he has now ruled himself out of this race.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May has also been floated as a possible “unity” candidate to succeed Truss. May tried to bring together the warring wings of the Conservative party over Brexit, in move that ultimately saw her replaced by Boris Johnson. As the party has proven unable to resolve its disputes this time round, another attempt at compromise may soon be in order.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/uk-no-election-explained-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "UK election: Why crisis-wracked nation won't be voting soon | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe United Kingdom is – once again – in the market for a new leader following the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss only six weeks into her disastrous premiership.\n\nTruss’ successor will be the fifth PM to lead the country since it voted for Brexit in 2016 – a decision that set into motion the turmoil that ultimately led to the current political chaos.\n\nAnd while a general election might seem to be the obvious way forward, Brits (and their dogs) are unlikely to be lining up in front of the ballot box any time soon. Here’s why.\n\nWhy won’t there be a new election?\n\nIn the UK, general elections must be held at least every five years.\n\nLuckily for the Conservative Party, which is currently in power but trailing the opposition in opinion polls, the next vote doesn’t need to be held until January 2025.\n\nThat’s because in the UK, prime ministers are not elected directly by the people. In fact, four of the last five British prime ministers came into the role without a general election.\n\nTruss is in Downing Street because she is the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. She was picked by the roughly 172,000 members of the Conservative Party after the departure of Boris Johnson, who himself became prime minister without a general election after winning the party leadership contest in 2019 – although he did call a new vote in December that year and won.\n\nTheresa May, who served as prime minister before Johnson, also first became PM without an election, as did Labour’s Gordon Brown when he replaced Tony Blair in 2007.\n\nSo how will the new PM be picked?\n\nThe Conservative Party is still the largest one in Parliament, so its new leader will automatically become prime minister.\n\nWhile the last leadership election took almost two months – longer than Truss will spend as prime minister – the next one will be swift.\n\nGraham Brady, leader of the 1922 Committee, which represents rank-and-file Conservative members of parliament, said Thursday the new PM will be chosen by next Friday.\n\nTo narrow the field of those in the running, the candidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from Conservative MPs, which means there will be a maximum of three people in the running.\n\nMust the new prime minister call a general election?\n\nNo. The next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025.\n\nHowever, the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote will put pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe last time three successive prime ministers entered Downing Street without standing in a general election was before and during the World War II.\n\nThe opposition, sensing an opportunity, is pushing for a new vote. Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, repeated his calls on Thursday for an early general election. “After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” he said in a statement posted on Twitter. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote, saying a new “general election is now a democratic imperative.”\n\nWhat do British people think about all this?\n\nJudging by the numerous protests, jokes and memes, many are far from impressed. A public petition calling for a new election was launched in September. It gathered more than 715,000 signatures and was debated in parliament earlier this week.\n\nHowever, there is little the public can do if the Conservative Party, which is firmly in control of parliament, decides not to call an election now. For many Conservative lawmakers, voting for an early election would mean the end of their political careers.

At 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nAfter being invited to form a government by the King, Sunak returned to Downing Street where he made a speech aimed at alleviating some of the concerns of the public and laying out aspects of what his premiership will look like.\n\nIn his first speech as Britain’s new prime minister, Sunak said the nation was in “profound economic crisis,” before paying tribute to Truss.\n\n“I admired her restlessness to create change. But some mistakes were made. Not borne of ill will or bad intentions.

Aaron Chown/AP Prev Next\n\nTuesday afternoon saw Sunak begin to form his new cabinet, bringing back lawmaker Dominic Raab as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor, and keeping Jeremy Hunt in the role of UK finance minister.\n\nHunt was appointed as chancellor earlier this month after Truss sacked his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. Hunt subsequently reverted most of Kwarteng’s main policies proposed in September’s controversial “mini-budget.”\n\nSunak brought Suella Braverman back as Home Secretary, a role she resigned from last week under Truss’s government, hastening the end of the former Prime Minister’s term. James Cleverly and Ben Wallace will remain in their roles of Britain’s foreign secretary and defence secretary, respectively.\n\nChallenges ahead for new PM\n\nTuesday’s developments are a stunning turnaround for the man whose resignation as finance minister was instrumental in bringing down Boris Johnson’s government earlier this year, but then lost the summer leadership race. At that point, it appeared Sunak’s ambitions for the highest political role in the country were over.\n\nAnd yet, when Truss’ premiership imploded last week, Sunak quickly became a frontrunner to take over the party once more. Now in the top job, he faces an overflowing in-tray of challenges to steer the country out of crisis.\n\nHis own party is divided and has lost ground to the opposition Labour party in opinion polls following four months of political mayhem and financial market chaos. At the same time, Britain is facing major economic crisis, with many economists believing it is already in recession.\n\nHe is already under intense fire from opposition politicians, who are calling for a general election.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer congratulated Sunak on becoming the first British-Asian prime minister on Tuesday, but reiterated calls for a public vote.\n\n“The Tories have crashed the economy, with low wages, high prices and a cost of living crisis. The public needs a fresh start and a say on Britain’s future,” Starmer said.\n\nSunak, like Truss, has not had to win a general election to become prime minister because the Conservatives are still the largest party in the House of Commons, therefore their leader automatically becomes prime minister.\n\nIt’s not unusual for a prime minister to come into office without an election – four of the last five British prime ministers first entered the role without a general election. But the fact that Sunak is the UK’s third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote adds to the pressure.\n\nAccording to the law, the next general election must happen no later than in January 2025. With Labour way ahead in opinion polls, it is very unlikely he will take that step.\n\nSunak is under no obligation to call a vote and appeared to rule out the possibility in his Downing Street address when he said that he’d “always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements.”\n\nHe added: “I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual. It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us.”\n\nJohnson later offered his congratulations to the new prime minister in a post on Twitter, calling his appointment a “historic day.”\n\n“This is the moment for every Conservative to give our new PM their full and wholehearted support,” Johnson said.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Ivana Kottasová", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/gallery/liz-truss/index.html", "title": "Photos: Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss | CNN", "text": "British Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation in front of No. 10 Downing Street on October 20.\n\nLiz Truss resigned as the United Kingdom's prime minister six weeks after being elected leader of the Conservative Party.

Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}]}

Former finance minister Rishi Sunak has emerged as the front-runner after Boris Johnson dramatically dropped out of the race. A fast-tracked process could see Sunak announced as prime minister at 9 a.m. ET today – if he is able to secure the support of 100 MPs in the Conservative Party, leaving him unopposed in the contest. Sunak’s only competition is Cabinet member Penny Mourdant, who came in third during the summer. The contest is being staged after Liz Truss quit the top job last week, becoming Britain’s shortest-serving leader ever. Sunak came in second to Truss during the previous contest, but his repeated warnings about her economic plan were proven accurate in record time, resulting in a healthy number of backers within the party.\n\n2. RSV\n\nA common respiratory virus known as RSV is spreading at unusually high levels in the US and is overwhelming children’s hospitals. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include a runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing, according to the CDC. But in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and serious illnesses. The CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV as it does for the flu, but it said last week there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with these cases at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Doctor explains what RSV symptoms to look for 01:45 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

With the jury selection beginning today, it’s a symbolic moment following years of investigations against Trump’s real estate business. Two of Trump Organization entities are charged with nine counts of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees. A possible plea deal was discussed, but Trump and his team rebuffed it, partly due to the potential political impact it could have of admitting any guilt.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Top reporters reveal what's happening inside Trump's orbit now 05:03 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

Can Ukraine land another ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe relative calm in Ukrainian cities far from the country’s battlefields was shattered by two painfully familiar sounds this week: the ominous ring of the air raid sirens, and the eruptions of Russian attacks.\n\nA wave of missiles, rockets and drones has struck dozens of locations across Ukraine since Monday, according to officials, targeting civilian infrastructure in several major cities, including Kyiv, located hundreds of miles from the front lines in the east and south.\n\nThe wide bombardment echoed the early days of Russia’s scattershot initial invasion in February, but also underlined that the conflict in Ukraine, which for months appeared to be descending into a slow and painful grind in the Donbas, has erupted once again as winter nears.\n\nNot for the first time, the war is teetering towards an unpredictable new phase. “This is now the third, fourth, possibly fifth different war that we’ve been observing,” said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Programme.\n\nThe strikes followed weeks of Ukrainian ground gains and began two days after a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge, the only crossing between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. That blast, which was used by the Kremlin as a justification for Monday’s onslaught, bruised the Russian psyche and handed Ukraine a significant strategic boost.\n\nWith the cold months nearing and likely bringing a slowdown in ground combat, experts say the next weeks of the war are now expected to be vital, and another potential spike in intensity looms over Ukraine as each side seeks to strike another blow.\n\n“What seemed a distant prospect for anything that could be convincingly described as a Ukraine victory is now very much more plausible,” Giles said. “The response from Russia is likely to escalate further.”\n\n‘Playing for the whistle’\n\nMonday’s attacks, and further strikes throughout the week, were evidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin lashing out after a series of setbacks in the war that have put him under pressure domestically.\n\nAnd the airborne strikes distract from what has been a dismal stretch for Russia in the ground war.\n\nOleksii Hromov, a senior Ukrainian military official, said last week that Kyiv’s forces have recaptured some 120 settlements since late September as they advance in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions. On Wednesday, Ukraine said it had liberated more five settlements in its slow but steady push in Kherson.\n\nRussia said Thursday its forces would help evacuate residents of occupied Kherson to other areas, as Ukraine’s offensive continued to make gains in the region. The announcement came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harm’s way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances.\n\nThese counter-offensives have shifted the momentum of the war and disproved a suggestion, built up in the West and in Russia during the summer, that while Ukraine could stoutly defend territory, it lacked the ability to seize ground.\n\nUkrainian troops hoist the country's flag above a building in Vysokopillya, in the southern Kherson region, last month. Ukrainian officials say they have liberated hundreds of settlements since their counter-offensive began. @AndriyYermak/Twitter\n\n“The Russians are playing for the whistle – (hoping to) avoid a collapse in their frontline before the winter sets in,” Samir Puri, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of “Russia’s Road to War with Ukraine,” told CNN.\n\n“If they can get to Christmas with the frontline looking roughly as it is, that’s a huge success for the Russians given how botched this has been since February.”\n\nFaced with growing setbacks, the Kremlin appointed a new overall commander of Russia’s invasion. But there is little sign that Gen. Sergey Surovikin can lead his forces back onto the front foot before the end of the year, given the pace and cost of the Ukrainian counter-offensives.\n\nUkrainian troops are focused primarily on pushing Russian forces eastwards, having crossed the Oskil River in late September, with Moscow likely preparing to defend the cities of Starobilsk and Svatove in the Luhansk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nLanding a major blow in Donbas would send another powerful signal, and Ukraine will be eager to improve on its gains before temperatures plummet on the battlefield, and the full impact of rising energy prices is felt around Europe.\n\n“There are so many reasons why there is an incentive for Ukraine to get things done quickly,” Giles said. “The winter energy crisis in Europe, and energy infrastructure and power being destroyed in Ukraine itself, is always going to be a test of resilience for Ukraine and its Western backers.”\n\nNATO leaders have vowed to stand behind Ukraine regardless of how long the war takes, but several European countries – particularly those that relied heavily on Russian energy – are staring down a crippling cost-of-living crisis which, without signs of Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, could endanger public support.\n\nRecent days have meanwhile shown that sites beyond the current theater of ground fighting are far from immune to attacks. It remains unclear exactly how the Kerch bridge bombing was carried out – and Kyiv has not claimed responsibility – but the fact that a target so deep in Russian-held territory could be successfully hit hinted at a serious Ukrainian threat towards key Russian assets.\n\nRussia scrambles for manpower\n\nRussia is struggling on the ground and has failed to achieve supremacy in the air, but Monday’s attacks may have achieved one goal – sending a signal of strength towards the growing list of Putin’s internal critics.\n\nThe assault damaged civilian infrastructure in cities all across Ukraine, killing multiple people and knocking out power in pockets of the country. They were “an indication of the nature of the threat from Russia,” Giles said. “For many months now, the Russian objective has been to destroy Ukraine rather than possess it.”\n\nUkraine’s national electricity company, Ukrenergo, says it has stabilized the power supply to Kyiv and central regions of Ukraine after much of the country’s electricity supply was disrupted by Russian missile attacks on Monday and Tuesday. But Ukrainian Prime Minister has warned that “there is a lot of work to do” to fix damaged equipment, and asked Ukrainians to reduce their energy usage during peak hours.\n\nExperts believe it remains unlikely that Russia’s aerial bombardment will form a recurrent pattern; while estimating the military reserves of either army is a murky endeavor, Western assessments suggest Moscow may not have the capacity to keep it up.\n\n“We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” Jeremy Fleming, a UK’s spy chief, said in a rare speech on Tuesday.\n\nThat conclusion was also reached by the ISW, which said in its daily update on the conflict Monday that the strikes “wasted some of Russia’s dwindling precision weapons against civilian targets, as opposed to militarily significant targets.”\n\nA crater left by a missile strike next to a children's playground in Kyiv on Monday. Ed Ram/Getty Images\n\n“Russia’s use of its limited supply of precision weapons in this role may deprive Putin of options to disrupt ongoing Ukrainian counter-offensives,” the ISW assessed.\n\nExactly how much weaponry and manpower each side has left in reserve will be crucial to determining how the momentum will shift in the coming weeks. Ukraine said it intercepted 18 cruise missiles on Tuesday and dozens more on Monday, but it is urging its Western allies for more equipment to repel any future attacks.\n\n“The barrage of missile strikes is going to be an occasional feature reserved for shows of extreme outrage, because the Russians don’t have the stocks of precision munitions to maintain that kind of high-tempo missile assault into the future,” Puri said.\n\nSome help for Putin may be on the way, however. An announcement by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Belarus and Russia will “deploy a joint regional group of troops” raised fears of deepened military cooperation between the close allies and that Belarusian troops could formally join Russia in its invasion. Belarus has been complaining of alleged Ukrainian threats to its security in recent days, which observers say could be a prelude to some level of involvement.\n\nThe impact of such an intervention in terms of pure manpower would be limited; Belarus has around 45,000 active duty troops, which would not significantly bolster Russia’s reserves. But it would threaten another assault on Ukraine’s northern flank below the Belarusian border.\n\n“The reopening of a northern front would be another new challenge for Ukraine,” Giles said. It would provide Russia a new route into the Kharkiv oblast (region), which has been recaptured by Ukraine, should Putin prioritize an effort to reclaim that territory, he said.\n\nAny further Belarusian involvement in the war could also have a psychological impact, Puri suggested. “Everyone’s mind in Ukraine and in the West has been oriented towards fighting one army,” he said. Inside Russia, Belarus joining the invasion “would play into Putin’s narrative that this war is about reuniting the lands of ancient Rus states.”\n\nA plea to the West\n\nBy flipping the narrative of the conflict over the past two months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has achieved one of his own key objectives: showing Ukraine’s Western allies that their military aid can help Kyiv win the war.\n\nNow Zelensky will hope for more supplies in the short-term as he seeks to drive home those gains. The leader has sought to highlight Ukraine’s success in intercepting Russian missiles, saying more than half of the missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a second wave of strikes on Tuesday were brought down.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Ukraine needed “more” systems to better halt missile attacks, ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.\n\n“These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles [this week] were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,” he said.\n\n“But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more,” Stoltenberg added.\n\nJustin Bronk, a military expert with the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), agreed with that assessment, telling CNN that, “Ukrainian interception success rates against Russian cruise missiles have risen significantly since the start of the invasion in February.”\n\nUkraine “badly needed” modern systems such as the IRIS-T that arrived this week from Germany and the NASAMS expected from the United States, Bronk said.\n\nBeyond weapons supplies, Ukraine will be watching to ensure that Western resolve stays firm if Russia tightens energy supplies even further.\n\n“There are many things Russia can do to make the war personal, not just for people of Ukraine but around Europe, to try to force pressure on governments to remove their support for Ukraine,” Giles said.\n\nThis week’s air strikes may point towards that endeavor; Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told CNN that around 30% of energy infrastructure in Ukraine was hit by Russian missiles on Monday and Tuesday. The minister told CNN that this was the “first time from the beginning of the war” that Russia has “dramatically targeted” energy infrastructure.\n\nThe coming weeks are therefore crucial both on the battlefield, as well as in Europe and around the globe, experts suggest. “As ever, where Putin goes next depends on how the rest of the world is responding,” Giles said. “Russia’s attitude is shaped by the failure of Western countries to confront and deter it.”\n\nIt means that, as winter approaches, the stakes of the war have been raised once more. “There’s no doubt Russia would like to keep it up,” Giles said. But the Ukrainian successes of recent weeks have sent a direct message to the Kremlin, too. “They are able to do things that take us by surprise, so let’s get used to it,” Giles said.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/europe/ukraine-missile-defense-race-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia's hit-and-miss missile blitz forces a frantic race to shore up ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Russian military appears to have embarked on a new tactic in its efforts to turn the tide of its faltering war: trying to overwhelm Ukraine’s largely Soviet-era air defenses with dozens of missiles and drones from multiple directions.\n\nAs Ukraine races to shore up its missile defenses in the wake of the assault, the math for Moscow is simple: A percentage of projectiles are bound to get through.\n\nRussia’s aerial onslaught of the last few days has been largely directed at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, using a variety of missiles and newly acquired Iranian drones. But while the damage has been substantial, Ukraine claims that it has taken out around half of the missiles fired – and it expects that success rate to improve as new air defenses arrive from Germany, the US and elsewhere.\n\nOver the last three days, the Russians have been using a mix of their missile stocks. The majority were air-launched cruise missiles, some delivered by bombers based near the Caspian Sea. But they also deployed ship-launched Kalibrs from the Black Sea, ground-launched Iskander cruise missiles and dozens of attack drones.\n\nThe great unknown is just how far such a blitz is depleting Russian inventories – and whether increasingly they will resort to stocks of older, less accurate but equally powerful missiles.\n\nEstimating Russian missile inventories is guesswork. In May, President Volodymr Zelensky said Russia had launched 2,154 missiles and had probably used up 60% of its precision-missile arsenal. That now looks like wishful thinking.\n\nThe Pentagon’s view at the time was that of its weapons stocks, Russia was “running the lowest on cruise missiles, particularly air-launched cruise missiles,” but that Moscow still had more than 50% of its pre-war inventory.\n\nSome of that inventory was dispatched this week. But Russia has recently resorted to using much older and less precise KH-22 missiles (originally made as an anti-ship weapon), of which it still has large inventories, according to Western officials. Weighing 5.5 tons, they are designed to take out aircraft carriers. A KH-22 was responsible for the dozens of casualties at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in June.\n\nEven the more modern KH-101 missile has an accuracy of up to 50 meters, which hardly qualifies as a “precision weapon.”\n\nThe Russians have also been adapting the S-300 – normally an air defense missile – as an offensive weapon, with some effect. These have wrought devastation in Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv, among other places, and their speed makes them difficult to intercept. But they are hardly accurate.\n\nThere’s no doubt this week’s missile attacks, beyond causing dozens of casualties, have inflicted significant damage. Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told CNN on Tuesday that around 30% of the country’s energy infrastructure had been hit by Russian missiles since Monday.\n\nHe told CNN’s Richard Quest that this was the “first time from the beginning of the war” that Russia has “dramatically targeted” energy infrastructure.\n\nBut Ukraine’s energy operators are getting used to repairing electricity substations, pylons and thermal power plants. Zelensky said Tuesday: “Most of the towns and villages, which terrorists wanted to leave without electricity and communication, already have electricity and communication back.”\n\nOver the past nine months, the Ukrainians have also had plenty of practice in using their limited air defenses, mainly BUK and S-300 systems. But Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Air Force Command, said Tuesday said of these systems: “This equipment does not last forever, there may be losses in combat operations.”\n\nAnd he noted that “the manufacturer of this [equipment] is Russia, so we will have to say goodbye to them sooner or later.”\n\nUkrainian air defense battalions have become innovative: One video from Monday, referenced by Zelensky, showed a soldier using a shoulder-held missile to bring down a Russian projectile, purportedly a cruise missile.\n\nInvestigators examine a crater next to a damaged bus following a missile strike in Dnipro on Monday. DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nZelensky said in a video message Tuesday that 20 of 28 missiles fired at Ukraine that morning had been shot down. Ukrainian officials have told CNN that more than half the Russian cruise missiles fired on Monday and Tuesday were brought down: 65 out of 112.\n\nBut that still means about 50 hit their targets, enough to cause massive damage.\n\nEstimating the proportion of Iranian-made Shahed drones being eliminated is more difficult, because so many are being used. Zelensky said that “every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” But he also said the bulk of them were being shot down.\n\nLast month, the US deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, Sasha Baker, said the US had seen “some evidence already” that the Iranian drones “have already experienced numerous failures.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Soldier shoots down Russian missile, Ukraine says 01:44 - Source: CNN\n\nAn ‘air shield’\n\nSpeaking to the G7 meeting on Tuesday, Zelensky appealed for an air shield for Ukraine.\n\n“When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror – missile strikes – will cease to work.”\n\nUkraine’s allies understand this need. Ahead of a meeting in Brussels Wednesday of Ukraine’s supporters, General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that “after Russia attacked the Ukrainian civilian population, we will be looking for air defense options that will help the Ukrainians.”\n\nA senior Defense Department official added that work was continuing on improving Ukrainian air defenses, including “finding Soviet-era capabilities to make sure that countries were ready (and) could donate them and help move those capabilities.”\n\nUkraine’s wish-list – circulated at Wednesday’s meeting – included missiles for their existing systems and a “transition to Western-origin layered air defense system” as well as “early warning capabilities.”\n\nMilley said that “what we think can be provided is an integrated air missile defense system.”\n\nSpeaking after the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, he said such a system would not “control all the airspace over Ukraine, but they are designed to control priority targets that Ukraine needs to protect. What you’re looking at really is short-range low-altitude systems and then medium-range medium altitude and then long-range and high altitude systems, and it’s a mix of all of these.”\n\nWestern systems are beginning to trickle in. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Tuesday that a “new era of air defense has begun” with the arrival of the first IRIS-T from Germany, and two units of the US National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAM) expected soon.\n\n“This is only the beginning. And we need more,” Reznikov said Wednesday before tweeting as he met with Ukraine’s donors at the Brussels meeting:” Item #1 on today’s agenda is strengthening (Ukraine’s) air defense. Feeling optimistic.”\n\nBut these are hardly off-the-shelf-items. The IRIS-T had to be manufactured for Ukraine. Western governments have limited inventories of such systems. And Ukraine is a very large country under missile attack from three directions.\n\nIt’s also uneconomical to waste advanced systems on taking out cheap drones. But there may be other answers for the hundreds of attack drones Russia is now deploying. According to Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian officials say that air defense forces are already taking down the “bulk” of the Shahed drones.\n\nUkraine’s senior military commander, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as “brothers in arms” for training an air defense battalion that had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheeds.\n\nHe said Poland had given Ukraine “systems” to help destroy the drones. Last month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling “advanced defensive technology” to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine.\n\nThere’s now a race between the Ukrainians’ ability to acquire new air defense hardware, train on it and deploy it – and the Russians’ ability to inflict massive damage on Ukrainian infrastructure (civilian and military) with their deep stocks of missiles, not all of which are precision weapons.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Ukraine needed “more” systems to better halt missile attacks. “These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles (this week) were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,” he said. “But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more.”\n\nUntil more arrive, there is the risk – all too familiar to the government and people of Ukraine – that the Russian mix of missiles will wreak much greater havoc among the civilian population, especially if the Russians persist with the tactic of using swarms of missiles, inundating air defenses.", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/europe/crimea-bridge-explosion-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Massive blast cripples parts of Crimea-Russia bridge, in blow to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a major blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a huge explosion early Saturday severely damaged the only bridge connecting the annexed Crimean Peninsula with the Russian mainland, crimping a key supply route for Moscow’s faltering war in Ukraine.\n\nThe blast collapsed part of the roadway on the Kerch Strait road-and-rail bridge – opened by Putin himself in 2018 – images and video from the scene showed. At least three people were killed in the explosion, Russian officials said, citing preliminary information.\n\nThe exact cause of the blast at Europe’s longest bridge is yet to be confirmed. Russian officials said a truck exploded, causing Crimea-bound sections of the bridge’s roadway to fall. A subsequent fire engulfed a train of fuel tanks on a separate, adjacent rail portion of the bridge.\n\nPutin ordered a “government commission” to examine the Kerch bridge “emergency” in Crimea, Russian state media TASS reported.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced the appointment of a new commander for what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine, according to Russian state media.\n\nThe new commander, General Sergey Surovikin, first saw service in Afghanistan before commanding a unit in the second Chechen war. He has commanded several motorized rifle divisions and was instrumental in Russia’s operations in Syria, and while there, was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.\n\nHis appointment is the latest promotion in a military career that began in 1983 but has also led him to be sanctioned this year by the European Union.\n\nThe long-term effects on the use of the bridge weren’t immediately clear. Russian officials said a limited amount of car traffic had resumed on undamaged sections of the bridge’s roadways by Saturday evening and that train services were resuming on the bridge’s railways.\n\nThe first passenger train resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday evening, traveling from the Crimean peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement late Saturday.\n\n“Double-decker train No. 28 departing from Simferopol [en route] to Moscow passed through the Crimean bridge. It became the first train to pass through the bridge after the emergency. Train No. 28 left the capital of the Republic of Crimea on schedule at 17:10 and has already passed through the bridge,” the statement reads.\n\nBut trucks were being asked to take ferries across the strait, state media reported.\n\nThe damage to the roadway appeared to be severe, with westbound lanes crippled in at least two places. Video and images from the 19-kilometer (11-mile) bridge appeared to show a portion of the roadway had fallen into the water.\n\nCrimea raised its terror-threat level to yellow on Saturday across much of the peninsula after the explosion, according to the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksenov, in a statement on his Telegram channel.\n\nAksenov also said that the ferry service in Crimea will operate free of charge and will be subsidized from the state budget. He added that all local hotels have confirmed free accommodation for tourists who were unable to leave the peninsula on Saturday.\n\nThe first ferry with passengers left the port in Kerch for the coast of Kuban, a region in southern Russia separated from the Crimean Peninsula by the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe lights on the bridge are set to be restored over Saturday night so that repairs can be carried out around the clock, according to a statement published on the website of the Russian Cabinet of Ministers, citing Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin.\n\nAccording to the statement, divers will start their work on Sunday morning and check all the supports of the bridge. Once all results are received, a decision will be made to open traffic on the bridge for buses and heavy vehicles.\n\nFor now, supply trucks and buses cannot use the bridge to travel from Crimea to Russia. Supply trucks and buses will instead travel from Crimea to Russia via ferry service, and not the bridge, Askenov said.\n\nAn official in Crimea blamed “Ukrainian vandals” for the explosion. Some Ukrainian officials gloated over the incident without directly claiming responsibility – even announcing commemorative stamps will be made. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that “the reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure testifies to its terrorist nature.”\n\nSmoke billows from fire on the Kerch bridge at sunrise on Saturday. Stringer/Reuters\n\nThe bridge is strategically important because it links Russia’s Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by the international community.\n\nIt is a critical artery for supplying Crimea with both its daily needs and supplies for the military. Over the last few months, dozens of Russian military convoys have used the bridge, carrying vehicles, armor and fuel.\n\nIf the Russian military’s use of the bridge is hampered, its supply lines to forces in southern Ukraine would become more tenuous, especially when combined with Ukrainian advances southward into Kherson region, north of Crimea.\n\nRussia has used the Crimean railroads to ferry supplies to forces in Kherson, and several rail hubs in both Crimea and Kherson have been attacked by long-range Ukrainian rockets.\n\nSergey Aksenov, the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea, said “two spans of the roadbed of the part [of the bridge] from Krasnodar to Kerch, collapsed” after the explosion, and that a train’s fuel tanks caught fire.\n\nPreliminary information indicates three people were killed in the incident, “presumably the passengers of a car that was next to the blown-up truck,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Telegram.\n\nAt least two bodies, that of a man and a woman, were recovered from the water, and their identities were being established, the investigative panel said.\n\nRecords indicate the truck that exploded belonged to someone in Russia’s Krasnodar region; investigators are checking the owner’s home and trying to determine the truck’s route, the investigative committee said.\n\nThe bridge spans the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, on which sit key Ukrainian ports, including Mariupol. For Russia, the bridge symbolizes the physical “reunification” of Crimea with the Russian mainland.\n\nNo further details on the timing or scope of the commission have been announced.\n\nRIA Novosti said that there are “no projections for the timing of the restoration of the Crimean bridge yet,” citing Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov.\n\nA view shows fuel tanks ablaze and damaged sections of the Kerch bridge on October 8, 2022.

And now they have something to be proud of, in 23 years of their economic activity, they did not manage to build anything deserving of interest in Crimea. But they did succeed in damaging the roadbed of the Russian bridge,” Chairman of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov said.\n\n“Such is the whole essence of the Kiev regime and the Ukrainian state … Of course, the causes of the accident will be investigated, and the damage will be repaired swiftly,” he added.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify Konstantinov’s claim.\n\nUkraine reacts to explosion\n\nUkrainian officials taunted Russia over the explosion without directly acknowledging that Ukraine was responsible for the attack.\n\n“Air defense of the Russian Federation, are you sleeping?” the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Facebook, alongside a video showing a section of the bridge’s road that had been completely destroyed.\n\n“Russian illegal construction is starting to collapse and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, sooner or later, it will explode. And this is just the beginning,” David Arakhamia, the head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s party in parliament and a member of Kyiv’s negotiating team with Russia, said in a Telegram statement about the incident.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, Oleksiy Danilov, posted video of the damaged Kerch bridge alongside a clip of Marilyn Monroe singing “Happy Birthday, Mr President,” which Monroe performed for President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Putin turned 70 on Friday.\n\nThe Ukrainian Postal Service will issue stamps featuring the damaged bridge, its CEO said Saturday.\n\n“I will not wish you a good day, because it is already wonderful. The Kerch bridge is done,” the official, Igor Smelyansky, said.\n\nOn Thursday, Oleksii Hromov, a senior official with the General Staff, said that since September 21, Ukrainian troops had managed to advance 55 kilometers in the north-east, “establish control over 93 settlements, [and] take control over more than 2,400 square kilometers.”\n\nHromov appeared to be referencing gains in Kharkiv region that were made before September 21 but only confirmed later.\n\nIn an interview in August, a senior Ukrainian military commander said the Kerch bridge was a legitimate target.\n\n“This is a necessary measure in order to deprive them (Russia) of the opportunity to provide reserves and reinforce their troops from Russian territory,” Maj. Gen. Dmytro Marchenko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine.\n\nCars queue for the ferry in Kerch, Crimea on Saturday after an explosion halted traffic on the bridge linking the peninsula with Russia.

Initially, Russia denied that its troops had carried out the mission. Later, it acknowledged that the so-called “little green men” were indeed Russian units. The West responded swiftly with crippling economic sanctions.\n\nRussia constructed the bridge after the annexation, spending an estimated $3.7 billion.\n\nThe damage done Saturday will be a psychological blow to Moscow – the bridge was the physical expression of Putin’s objective to bind Ukraine to Russia. The day it opened in 2018, he led a triumphant convoy over the bridge, driving a truck festooned with flags.\n\nAnalysis: What the bridge explosion means for Putin and his war effort\n\nAfter the bridge opened, the United States condemned its construction as illegal.\n\n“Russia’s construction of the bridge serves as a reminder of Russia’s ongoing willingness to flout international law,” according to a US State Department statement at the time.\n\nPutin drives a Kamaz truck during a ceremony opening the bridge on May 15, 2018.

The share of green energy in Ukraine's energy system was about 10% before the invasion, the energy minister said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday.\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a \"special military operation\" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been \"stiffer than expected\" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a \"grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.\"\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a \"hostile act\" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015 , the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create \"a pretext for an invasion.\"\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as \"one people,\" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a \"forced change of identity.\"\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's \"puppet.\"\n\nIn fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. \"It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,\" he said at his annual news conference late last year. \"Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.\"\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a \"genocide\" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements \"no longer exist,\" adding: \"What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?\"\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords , which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. \"Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,\" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: \"We are not his.\"\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n\"Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,\" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists\n\nUkraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. \"Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted \"urgently\" to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin's invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. \"I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,\" he said Sunday,\n\nPhotos: The world rallies in support of Ukraine People in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Hide Caption 28 of 28\n\nTensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea -- in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin's decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/europe/ukraine-conflict-russia-losses-intl/index.html", "title": "Pro-Russia media slam war setbacks as Putin predicts annexed ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he expects the situation to stabilize in four war-torn regions of Ukraine after signing legislation to annex them on Wednesday, despite the fact that Russia’s military does not fully control those areas.\n\nWhile Russian state television hailed Putin’s inking of the annexation process, pro-Kremlin pundits delivered rare dispatches on the growing setbacks faced by Moscow’s troops on the ground.\n\nRussian forces appear to be buckling under growing pressure as Ukraine continues to regain territory in the south, where Russian soldiers have been forced to retreat from previously-held settlements as Kyiv progresses with its counteroffensive towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson.\n\nDespite losing territory in the south to Ukrainian military at rapid pace, Putin on Wednesday signed several laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nIn a bid to celebrate the news, Putin took the opportunity in a televised meeting for Teachers’ Day to congratulate educators from “all 89 regions of Russia,” a number that includes the newly annexed territories.\n\nPutin said he was “pleased” and “surprised” by the referendums’ results and claimed that the regions will now be stabilized and developed while “helping strengthen the country as a whole.”\n\nThe annexations are illegal under international law. World leaders have said they are the result of “sham” referendums that will never be recognized.\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk are both in eastern Ukraine, and fighting against Moscow-backed breakaway republics in each region has been raging since 2014. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February.\n\nRussia has vowed to take control of all of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but its goals in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are less clear, which has created confusion about the boundaries that Russia is claiming.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday also issued conflicting announcements over the management of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Putin signed a decree to claim the plant, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, as under Russian state control; meanwhile the head of Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, said that he was taking charge.\n\n“Undoubtedly, our work, our destiny, our homes and our future are with Ukraine, as always. We will continue to work in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, in the Ukrainian energy system, in Energoatom. Don’t doubt it!” Petro Kotin said in a video address to the plant’s employees.\n\nThat Russia does not have full control of the regions it claims to have seized was made clear by a map used by the Russian Defense Ministry in its daily briefing on Tuesday. The map confirmed significant Russian losses in Kherson compared to a map of the same area used in a ministry briefing a day before. It reinforces reports from Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials, as well as pro-Russian military analysts, of significant Ukrainian gains towards Kherson, down the western bank of the Dnieper River.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, who spoke while the map was shown full-screen, did not mention the losses. However, he said that Russian military destroyed Ukrainian armor and killed Ukrainian forces in the area of several towns that are now understood to be under Ukrainian control – a tacit acknowledgment of Kyiv’s push.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the military for their “fast and powerful advances” in his Tuesday evening address, before celebrating that “dozens of settlements have already been liberated” this week.\n\nIn Kherson region, he said that Liubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Biliaiivka, Ukraiinka, Velyka, Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid had all been reclaimed, “and this is not a complete list.”\n\n“Our warriors do not stop. And it is only a matter of time when we will expel the occupier from all our land,” the president added.\n\nZelensky on Wednesday assembled his top military and security staff to consider plans for “further liberation of Ukrainian territories,” according to the readout of the meeting from the President’s office.\n\nIn addition to Ukraine’s successes in the south, Kyiv’s forces made gains in Luhansk in the east with forces approaching the region from several directions, and over the weekend liberated the strategic city of Lyman, a key operational hub in Donetsk which the Russian army had used to funnel troops and supplies to the west and south.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was forced to cede Lyman or risk encirclement of its troops there, allowing Ukrainian forces to potentially use the city as a staging post to push troops further east.\n\nAsked by CNN how to interpret the language of the laws signed by Putin – which refers to the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as “the territory which existed on the day of its adoption in the Russian Federation” – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “I will leave this question unanswered.”\n\nWhen pressed to clarify by CNN, Peskov added: “You should read the decree; there is a legal wording there. On the whole, of course, we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of its adoption [as part of the Russian Federation].”\n\n‘Painful as getting thumped on your melon’\n\nThe Russian-appointed deputy leader in the occupied Kherson region explained Ukraine’s rapid advance in recent days by saying that the Russian military was “regrouping.”\n\n“The Russian army is conducting maneuvers,” Kirill Stremousov told Russian state news RIA Novosti. “The regrouping of the front in the current conditions allows us to gather strength and strike.”\n\nThe phrase “regrouping” was also used by the Russian Defense Ministry in September to describe the retreat of the Russian military in response to Ukraine’s offensive that recaptured the key city of Izium, in the Kharkiv region.\n\nStremousov on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine’s advance had been stopped, and that it was “impossible” for them to enter the occupied city of Kherson.\n\nUkrainian soldiers adjust a national flag on an armored personnel carrier on a road near Lyman, Donetsk region on October 4, 2022. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, pro-Russian media has been uncommonly critical of the war effort in recent days, delivering gloomy reports that Russia’s campaign is suffering an operational crisis while Ukraine takes advantage on the battlefield.\n\n“In the Kherson region, we have lost 17 settlements,” Alexander Sladkov, a leading Russian war correspondent, conceded on state TV Tuesday, before placing the blame on “fat” US weapons deliveries and “intelligence gathered via satellite reconnaissance.”\n\nSladkov is just one of several Russian correspondents to convey the losses Russia is suffering.\n\nAlexander Kots, a correspondent for pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, who is embedded with Russian forces in the occupied eastern city of Svatove, told his Telegram followers Wednesday that the military lacks the manpower necessary to hold off a further Ukrainian advance into the Luhansk region.\n\n“The Russian troops do not have enough manpower to stop the enemy attacks,” Kots said in a video. “The recent Russian losses are directly connected to that. It’s a very difficult period of time on the front line at the moment.”\n\nHe said that “we expect a serious fighting here very soon,” and that “it remains to be seen if it could stop the enemy advances.”\n\nKots confirmed that Russian forces were trying to fortify their defense at the line connecting the occupied cities of Kreminna and Svatova. Yuriy Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger said on Monday that Russian troops had withdrawn to the Zherebets River, which runs just west of Kreminna and Svatova.\n\nHe said that Ukrainian forces are “on the high and enjoying a numeric advantage.”\n\n“They don’t have problems with the intelligence data or high-precision weapons which they are constantly using. We are just waiting for our reserves to become fighting fit and join the battle.”\n\nMeanwhile, state media reporter Evgeniy Poddubnyy, a correspondent for Russia 24, said Tuesday that “we’re going through the hardest time on the frontline” and that “for the time being it will become even harder.”\n\nSladkov, for his part, tried to put a positive spin on things.\n\n“This doesn’t mean that we’ve collapsed like a house of cards. These mistakes aren’t gigantic strategic failures. We are still learning. I know this is hard to hear in our eighth month of the special operation. But we are reporters. We are waiting for reinforcements.\n\nHost Olga Skabeeva appeared visibly angry, before asking Sladkov if the entire Kherson region was in danger of being lost.\n\n“We don’t have enough troops at the moment to move on Kyiv or to quickly take Kharkiv, but they are sufficient to continue protecting the territories that we are already protecting,” he responded. “In straightening out our front line, we’ve had to retreat from these settlements.”\n\nHe added: “It’s as painful as getting thumped on your melon. We’ve suffered losses. But it’s war. And these kinds of things happen in war. [Reinforcements] are coming, along with their equipment. I don’t lie or engage in propaganda. I’m just a regular reporter who is describing what is happening.”\n\nSladkov’s admission on State TV was his second in less than a month, after he previously admitted that Russian forces had endured heavy losses on September 13, a Tuesday. At the beginning of this Tuesday’s interview, Sladkov quipped: “I only tell the truth on Tuesdays, and for other days I just make everything up.”", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Mick Krever Uliana Pavlova", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Mick Krever", "Uliana Pavlova"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/23/biden-g-7-economy-war-russia/7677777001/", "title": "Biden meeting with G-7 nations on economic crisis, conflict with ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Skyrocketing gas prices.

Demilitarization in action.”\n\nLast Tuesday, a series of explosions damaged at least eight aircraft and infrastructure at a Russian military air base in Novofedorivka, on Crimea’s west coast.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry statement did not clarify how much military equipment and ammunition may have been destroyed in the latest incident. Footage of the facility posted on social media last week showed large ammunition stacks and several military vehicles with “Z” markings, a Russian pro-war symbol.\n\nThe explosions at the depot were caused by a fire, the head of the Crimea administration Sergei Aksyonov said in his Telegram channel, citing the Russian ministry of defense, adding the detonations were still ongoing.\n\n“The evacuation of residents is underway, people are taken out of the five-kilometer zone from the incident to ensure safety,” Aksyonov said, adding that defense ministry officials, military service members and emergency services are involved.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Podolyak later said a nearby substation that was being used to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had also affected by explosions at the depot.\n\n“You must understand that they stole from the Zaporizhzhia NPP in order to send electricity to Crimea through Dzhankoi,” Podolyak said later in a televised interview. “I think and believe that this is karmic retribution. Everything that is stolen does not bring wealth.”\n\nCNN could not independently verify Podolyak’s claim that power from the Zaporizhzhia station was being diverted to Crimea via Dzhankoi. The plant, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, is located in southern Ukraine and was captured by Russian forces in the early days of the invasion. In recent days it has become the focal point of growing global concern over the potential for a nuclear disaster, after increased shelling triggered calls for international experts to visit the facility.\n\nThe explosion at Maiskoye is the second security incident at a military installation in Crimea in the past week.\n\nLast Tuesday, the blasts at the Novofedorivka Russian air base destroyed at least eight Russian military aircraft, satellite imagery reviewed by CNN showed. The explosions also killed one person and injured 14, according to the Crimean health ministry.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said that incident was caused by the accidental detonation of ammunition. Ukraine did not publicly claim responsibility for the incident.\n\nPodolyak said Moscow’s explanations for the Tuesday blasts, as well as of the explosions last week, suggested the Russian military was deploying “untrained” staff to some locations.\n\nIn his nightly video message on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukrainians living in occupied areas to stay clear of Russian forces’ military facilities.\n\n“I am asking now all our people in Crimea, in other areas, in the south of the country, in the occupied areas of Donbas and Kharkiv region to be very careful,” he said. “Please do not go near the military facilities of the Russian army and all those places where they store ammunition and equipment, where they keep their headquarters.”\n\nFollowing the explosion in Maiskoye, train services from Russia into Crimea were suspended across most of the occupied peninsula.\n\nAksyonov, the head of the Crimea administration, later said on Telegram that “damaged railroad tracks in the Dzhankoi area have been restored.”\n\n“Train traffic on this section will be resumed after the completion of all necessary safety measures,” he added.\n\nDzhankoi sits on a train line connecting Crimea to Melitopol. According to several Ukrainian officials, the line is regularly used to transport military equipment to the front lines.\n\nReferring to long queues of traffic seen leaving Crimea for Russia after last week’s attack, Zelesnky said on Tuesday: “The queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia via the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them. “", "authors": ["Uliana Pavlova Alex Stambaugh Fred Pleitgen Vasco Cotovio Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Uliana Pavlova", "Alex Stambaugh", "Fred Pleitgen", "Vasco Cotovio", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/ukraine-bucha-horrors/index.html", "title": "At a mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine, the horrors of Putin's invasion ...", "text": "Bucha, Ukraine (CNN) Vladimir stands on the edge of a mass grave in the Ukrainian town of Bucha , on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Now it wants to ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn recent months, bots have been top of mind for many who track the social media industry, thanks to Elon Musk’s attempt to use the prevalence of fake and spam accounts to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. But bots aren’t just a challenge for Twitter.\n\nLinkedIn, often thought of as a tamer social platform, is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated and adaptable bad actors. The professional networking site has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers or applying for high-profile job openings.\n\nNow, LinkedIn is rolling out new features to help users evaluate the authenticity of other accounts before engaging with them, the company told CNN Business, in an effort to promote trust on a platform that is often key to job searching and making professional connections.\n\n“While we continually invest in our defenses” against inauthentic behavior, LinkedIn product management vice president Oscar Rodriguez said in an interview, “from my perspective, the best defense is empowering our members on decisions about how they want to engage.”\n\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT), says it already removes 96% of fake accounts using automated defenses. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. (LinkedIn does not disclose an estimate for the total number of fake accounts on its platform.)\n\nStarting this week, however, LinkedIn is rolling out to some users the opportunity to verify their profile using a work email address or phone number. That verification will be incorporated into a new, “About this Profile” section that will also show when a profile was created and last updated, to give users additional context about an account they may be considering connecting with. If an account was created very recently and has other potential red flags, such as an unusual work history, it could be a sign that users should proceed with caution when interacting with it.\n\nThe verification option will be available to a limited number of companies at first, but will become more widely available over time, and the “About this Profile” section will roll out globally in the coming weeks, according to the company.\n\nLinkedin's new 'About this Profile' feature will show users when an account was created, when it was last updated and whether it has been verified using a work email or phone number. Courtesy Linkedin\n\nThe platform will also begin alerting users if a message they have received seems suspicious — such as those that invite the recipient to continue the conversation on another platform including WhatsApp (a common move in cryptocurrency-related scams) or those that ask for personal information.\n\n“No single one of these signals by itself constitutes suspicious activity … there are many perfectly good and well-intended accounts that have joined LinkedIn in the past week,” Rodriguez said. “The general idea here is that if a member sees one or two or three flags, I want them to enter into a mindset of, thinking for a moment, ‘Hey, am I seeing something suspicious here?’”\n\nThe approach is somewhat unique among social media platforms. Most, including LinkedIn, allow users to file a report when they suspect inauthentic behavior but don’t necessarily offer clues about how to detect it. Many services also only offer verification options for celebrities and other public figures.\n\nLinkedIn says it has also improved its technology to detect and remove accounts using AI-generated profile photos.\n\nThe technology used to create AI-generated images of fake people has advanced significantly in recent years, but there are still some telltale signs that an image of a person may have been created by a computer. For example, that person may be wearing only one earring, have their eyes centered perfectly on their face or have strangely coiffed hair. Rodriguez said the company’s machine learning model also looks at smaller, harder to perceive signals, sometimes on the pixel level, such as how light is dispersed throughout the image, to detect such images.\n\nEven third-party experts say detecting and removing bot and fake accounts can be a difficult and highly subjective exercise. Bad actors may use a mix of computers and human management to run an account, making it harder to tell if it’s automated; computer systems can rapidly and repeatedly create numerous fake accounts; a single human could simply be using an otherwise real account to perpetuate scams; and the AI used to detect inauthentic accounts is not always a perfect tool.\n\nWith that in mind, LinkedIn’s updates are designed to give users more information as they navigate the platform. Rodriguez said that while LinkedIn is starting with profile and message features, it plans to expand the same kind of contextual information to other key decision-making points for users.\n\n“This journey of authenticity is really significantly bigger than issues around fake accounts or bots,” Rodriguez said. “Fundamentally, we live in a world that is ambiguous and the notion of what is a fake account or real account, what is a good investment opportunity or job opportunity, are all ambiguous decisions.”\n\nThe job hunting process always involves some leaps of faith.

Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz are vying for votes in Pennsylvania in a race that is considered the Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat in the Senate, with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey retiring at the end of the term. During the debate, Fetterman’s delivery was at times halting and repetitive, dropping words during answers and occasionally losing his train of thought. He is currently recovering from a stroke he suffered in May. Much of the attention heading into the debate focused on how Fetterman’s struggle with auditory processing and speech could impact the conversation against Oz, a celebrity doctor who rose to fame by hosting a daily television show for years. But the debate ultimately emphasized the deep policy differences between the candidates, with the two sparring over energy policy, abortion and the economy.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe Justice Department is asking a federal judge to force two of former President Donald Trump’s White House lawyers to testify about their conversations with the former President, according to three people familiar with the investigation. The move to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin just last week is part of a set of secret court proceedings. Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations about the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators. Separately, Hope Hicks, who served as Trump’s communications director, is being called back for a formal interview with the House select committee investigating the insurrection, a source familiar with the details told CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Most aggressive subpoena I've ever seen': Honig on Jan 6 committee's latest move 04:23 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Iran\n\nAnti-government protests have gripped Iran since the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being taken by morality police to a “re-education center” for apparently not wearing her hijab properly. Today marks the 40th day since her death and in Iranian culture, the 40-day mark of a person’s passing is an important day of mourning. According to Iran’s state-run media IRNA, Amini’s family will not hold a gathering for her passing today in an effort to quell the violence. “Considering the circumstances and in order to avoid any unfortunate problem, we will not hold a ceremony marking the 40th day,” the family’s statement said, according to IRNA. On Sunday, President Biden threw his support behind the demonstrators in the country, saying the US stands with the “brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.” In response, Iran said it will sue the US, alleging “direct involvement” in the protests.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter explains why journalists are being arrested for covering protest 02:45 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Voting machines\n\nTwo counties in the Western battleground states of Arizona and Nevada are moving forward with plans to hand count ballots in this year’s consequential midterm elections – a sign of the deep distrust of electronic vote tallying machines in some pockets of the country. Officials in the two communities still plan to use machines for the tallies, but experts worry the additional hand counts could result in two different totals and could further undermine public trust in elections. Critics also say hand counting thousands of ballots is not likely to produce accurate results. Meanwhile, local election workers are leaving their posts in droves due to continued threats and harassment as the November midterms draw closer. In some places, the exodus has opened the door to election deniers seeking roles in county elections offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Woman confronts armed man near ballot drop box 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

The Twitter firehose is the real-time stream of the millions of public tweets posted on the platform daily and information on the accounts behind them, although it does not contain private information such as the IP address from which the tweet was posted.\n\nTwitter (TWTR) may have been backed into a corner after Musk’s lawyer argued he was being denied information to which he is entitled through the deal. But in handing over access to the data firehose, Twitter (TWTR) risks attempting to address one problem — Musk’s questionable threats to ditch the acquisition over bot activity, which some analysts believe is simply a pretext to abandon a deal he now feels is overpriced — while possibly creating new issues.\n\nThe seemingly unprecedented nature of sharing such data with Musk — an individual who doesn’t work for the company, isn’t a researcher and doesn’t belong to the handful of companies who pay to access the data — could create a number of unknowns, from competitive risks to privacy concerns, some industry watchers note. And that’s not to mention Musk’s history of inflammatory and sometimes erratic behavior online and offline.\n\n“Musk in the past, we’ve seen he’s an iconoclast, he loves to air grievances openly, on social media,” said Inga Trauthig, a senior research fellow at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin. Other companies have access to this data, she notes, but “surely they have extremely detailed NDA contracts. ‘Will Musk have the same?’ is the first part of the question, and the second will be, ‘will he stick to them?’”\n\nIn the letter requesting more data from Twitter, Musk’s lawyer said the billionaire would ensure that “anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement” and would not “retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.” However, Musk tweeted just last month that Twitter’s legal team had contacted him to “complain that I violated their NDA” with another comment he made about bots.\n\nMusk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the report that the company will share the firehose with Musk but pointed to a previous statement saying the company has and would continue to proactively share information with Musk in accordance with the acquisition agreement.\n\nBeyond the unknowns of how exactly Musk will use the data, there are questions about what, if anything, Musk will be able to deduce from the data that the company itself cannot. Twitter regularly releases its own estimates of the number of bots on the platform, and has said such accounts make up less than 5% of monetizable daily active users. Among its social media peers, Twitter has historically been the most transparent about bot activity on its platform by making public disclosures, among other steps, according to Trauthig.\n\nThat he is now suddenly fixated on bots as an issue “either means that Musk really was completely unaware of how social media works in general, and Twitter in particular, or this is some sort of political maneuvering,” she said.\n\nMusk said at a Miami tech conference last month that he believes bots and fake users make up at least 20% of Twitter’s user base, and perhaps as much as 90%. While some experts do think the presence of bots could be slightly higher than the company’s estimates, most believe the number isn’t as high as Musk has suggested.\n\nThe exact number of bots seems “largely beside the point” if Musk’s claim is that “due to his business acumen and technical knowledge … he can make this company profitable and more useful,” said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law and a founding co-director of the UW Tech Policy Lab.\n\nMoreover, there is no clear definition of what a bot or spam or fake account is, and they’re not all problematic — though Musk, who is known to have many spam accounts following him, has painted them broadly as a scourge. “I think that trust is extremely important and just for the usefulness of the system, getting rid of troll farms and bots and spammers is incredibly important,” he told Twitter employees at a company town hall event Thursday.\n\nTypically, bots are considered to be accounts that use automated computer systems, in whole or in part, to post and interact with other users, according to Kaicheng Yang, who researches inauthentic actors on social media with the Indiana University Observatory on Social Media. Some automated accounts are harmless, like news update accounts or a Big Ben account that tweets “BONG” on the hour, every hour. And some accounts are run by humans who appear to intentionally mimic computer behavior to throw off other users.\n\n“We don’t even have a clear definition of what we are talking about,” said Yang, who created a tool called Botometer that examines the bot-like activity of Twitter accounts. He added that automation itself is not bad, “it’s a feature that Twitter offers and does help in many cases, and sometimes it’s just for entertainment.”\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal referenced those inherent challenges in counting bots during a back-and-forth with Musk on Twitter last month. “Spam isn’t just ‘binary’ (human / not human),” Agrawal tweeted. “The most advanced spam campaigns use combinations of coordinated humans + automation … they are sophisticated and hard to catch.” (Musk responded to Agrawal’s tweet thread with a poop emoji.)\n\nSimply examining data on the tweets that are posted to Twitter may also leave out some bot or fake accounts that don’t actually post to the platform. “One of the main ways that inauthentic behavior is used in the political environment is to make someone look more popular than they are by generating a bunch of random accounts and following them … by getting access to the firehose, it doesn’t even give you an accurate picture of inauthentic behavior that could be problematic,” said Calo.\n\n“I think it defies imagination that Musk and his collaborators would be in a better position to give a good faith estimate of what the automated activity is,” Calo said. “So, this is kind of like sharing a lot of information for no good reason, and whenever you do that, it raises concerns.”\n\nEven if Musk comes up with a number of bots that makes him feel comfortable with completing the takeover deal for Twitter, it’s not clear exactly what he’ll do about the issue.\n\nDuring the town hall Thursday, Musk suggested that the company should authenticate users behind accounts in order to label accounts that are not automated — potentially by requiring them to sign up with Twitter’s subscription service, Twitter Blue — and to promote content from those verified accounts. However, some online safety experts and Twitter employees have raised concerns that such a system could do away with the anonymity that allows, for example, users in certain countries to speak freely.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Ex-Twitter exec blows the whistle, alleging reckless and negligent ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Cnn Business Video John General Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html", "title": "The dark side of Discord for teens | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen a mother in Washington state learned her teenage daughter was on Discord, a popular social media platform, she felt reasonably comfortable with the idea of her using it to communicate with members of her high school marching band.\n\nBut in September, the mother discovered the 16-year-old was also using the audio and chat service to message with someone who appeared from his profile picture to be an older man. The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like other parents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.) The mother received an automated email from its Trust and Security team.\n\n“We’re sorry to hear that you came across this type of content, and we understand that this can be extremely concerning,” said the Discord response, reviewed by CNN Business. “Unfortunately, we’re unable to locate the content with the information you’ve provided. We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board. But those guardrails won’t necessarily exist under Musk’s leadership.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/tech/twitter-free-speech-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Twitter has been focused on 'healthy conversations.' Elon Musk ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Four years ago, Twitter cofounder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey laid out four key focus areas that would propel the company's growth. Among them: promoting \"healthy conversation\" on the platform.\n\nAfter years of criticism for Twitter's apparent failures to prevent its platform from turning toxic, Dorsey acknowledged the scourge of \"abuse, harassment, troll armies,\" as well as bots, misinformation campaigns and \"increasingly divisive echo chambers\" on the social network , and he called on researchers to help improve the situation.\n\n\"We think it is a growth vector over the long term, and it's the right thing to do for the people on Twitter, and also for the world,\" Dorsey said on the company's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2018 of the focus on the \"health\" of the platform.\n\nIn the years since,has made significant progress toward that goal , including banning manyaccounts promoting abuse and spam, adding labels for false or misleading information, banning the misgendering of transgender people and launching a team dedicated to studying and increasing transparency around the technology that determines what content is promoted on the site. Just last week, Twitter said it would embrace third-party tools for users to help prevent harassment.\n\nBut some who've been following the work Twitter has done in recent years worry it could be unraveled now that billionaire Elon Musk has succeeded in his bid to acquire Twitter in a deal worth about $44 billion.\n\nMusk, a controversial Twitter user with a history of erratic behavior on and off the platform, has called for freer speech on the social network and policies that would favor leaving up most tweets and accounts.\n\n\"If in doubt, let the speech exist,\" Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference earlier this month. \"If it's a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there's perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.\"\n\nUnder his ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken in recent years to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nBeyond potentially alienating employees who have worked on or support efforts to improve content moderation on the platform, undoing Twitter's progress on \"healthy conversations\" also risks losing users at a time when the company has been fighting to reverse sluggish growth. It could also turn off advertisers wary of having their ads run next to harmful content. While Musk has said his bid for Twitter is \"not a way to make money,\" it is still a business and advertising remains its central revenue driver.\n\nThough smaller than some rival platforms, Twitter also has an outsized influence in the online (and offline) world because it is popular among influential figures in media, politics and entertainment, and because it has often acted as a model for other platforms on how to address thorny harmful content issues. Thus, changes to Twitter's policies could have broader ripple effects on politics and society.\n\nTwitter has certainly not been perfect on content moderation issues, but as Kirsten Martin, professor of technology ethics at Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, put it: \"Twitter has consistently strived to be a responsible social media company through not only their content moderation but also their hires in the area of machine learning ethics.\"\n\n\"I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter's values,\" Martin added.\n\nTwitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA billionaire with a history of trolling\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era, but he is also someone who has courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has 83 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand is a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and he has compared Twitter's new CEO Parag Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nElon Musk is one of the highest profile but most controversial users on Twitter, where he has more than 83 million followers.\n\nMusk and others have pointed out that most of Twitter's board has little experience actually using the platform. The same cannot be said of Musk, an avid Twitter user with a rabid following who well understands the dynamics of the platform. Still, Musk's experience of using Twitter as an ultra-rich, White man, is inherently different than that of most users, and especially those who are women or from other marginalized communities Twitter has tried to protect and who now may be at risk if its moderation policies are rolled back.\n\n\"Any time somebody says free speech, it always means free speech for the powerful. It does not mean free speech for the less powerful,\" said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter engineering manager who started its product safety and security team and left the company in 2015 . \"[Musk] says he wants to make it a free speech platform. What he wants is a platform to say what he wants — and wants other people like him to say what they want — without any accountability.\"\n\nFor his part, Musk said on Twitter Monday: \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\"\n\nProminent users like game developer Brianna Wu have for years spoken out about how online Twitter mobs can spiral from online hate speech to real-world harm. She now worries the progress she and other users have pushed for on Twitter will be reversed.\n\n\"There have been so many hard fought battles over these [safety] policies behind the scenes,\" Wu, who now serves as executive director of a PAC for progressives, told CNN Business. \"I am extremely concerned Musk is going to roll back all the hard work that's been done to combat hate speech on the platform.\"\n\nMusk's plan for Twitter\n\nAt the TED conference earlier this month, Musk presented his broad strokes vision for Twitter, including making its algorithm public to increase transparency around its decisions about content enforcement and promotion — a move that experts say it is far from a silver bullet . Moreover, Musk said Twitter would be more \"reluctant to delete things\" and \"very cautious with permanent bans.\"\n\n\"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,\" Musk said.\n\nMany followers of the company have speculated that if his takeover bid succeeds, Musk could restore the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned early last year following the insurrection at the US Capitol. Such a move could have huge implications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election as Twitter was a key tool for Trump to rally his base, promote political allies and deride critics and spread false and misleading claims.\n\n\"If Musk buys Twitter, then he will surely return Trump to the platform, opening the door for a viable 2024 run,\" Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said on Twitter Monday before the deal was announced.\n\nDonovan also noted that under Musk's leadership, Twitter could \"further become a terrain of culture wars. With a mandate for 'free speech,' the kind of harassment that content moderation tampers will go into overdrive targeting lgbtq groups, women, BIPOC, and anyone else fighting for civil rights.\"\n\nMusk said in a statement Monday that he also wants \"to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\"\n\nA platform with more work to do\n\nEach of the major social media platforms have faced pressure from lawmakers, researchers and the public to do more to crack down on abuse, harassment and misinformation, and have taken different approaches with varying degrees of success. Twitter has in many cases been seen as a leader in the industry in terms of how it handles problematic content, and in being transparent about its approach and the success of its efforts. Most notably, Twitter was the first of the major platforms to ban Trump for violating its policy on inciting violence, pushing other platforms to follow suit.\n\n\"It's not great today, but it's better,\" Wu said. \"I think people don't understand how much we have to lose.\"\n\nTwitter's board is said to be nearing an agreement to sell the social media company to Elon Musk.\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he's hopeful that Twitter remains a place where people can speak freely while also feeling safe. \"When I say safe and secure, I mean from bigotry, and the kind of terrible trolling that makes it too toxic for so many of us,\" he added.\n\nOthers, however, are less optimistic. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said that Musk has a \"fairly unsophisticated view\" of the factors a platform must consider when it \"provides access for bad actors to normal people.\"\n\nHarmful content can have real-world consequences — the Myanmar Genocide and the Capitol Riot are two of the most egregious examples, but a deluge of harassment and veiled threats of offline harm can severely impact users on an individual basis, as well — and social media platforms face a difficult balancing act in considering how to allow users to speak as freely as possible while also protecting them from such harms.\n\nWhile Musk has said he wants to allow \"all legal speech on Twitter,\" the lines for what is legal can be blurry and vary from country to country — and may also be soon to change, as regulators home in on the harms social media platforms can have on users, especially young people, and civic processes.\n\n\"[Twitter has] started to talk about the morality of what they do, in a way that implies that they get it,\" Ahmed said. But with Musk, \"it feels like ... we have to go and re-educate another kind of billionaire, libertarian, man-child that [Twitter] is the real world ... I would hope he can see the difference between you know, being a douche and being dangerous.\"\n\nSome experts also question whether a less-moderated platform would be a sustainable business. Several new platforms launched in recent years have promised to take a less restrictive approach to content moderation, often in hopes of attracting right-leaning users frustrated with the Big Tech giants, but have largely failed to gain significant adoption. The most recent example: Trump's Truth Social . Online advertisers are also hesitant to have their ads run alongside dangerous or controversial content.\n\n\"The general public doesn't want to see more conspiracy theories and more harassment and more hate speech,\" said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund. \"There's this [disconnect] between what he's saying he wants to do [to loosen content restrictions], which sounds like a culture war initiative, versus saying that he wants to increase their profits. It doesn't seem to add up.\"", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/tech/instagram-update-backlash-kardashians/index.html", "title": "Instagram has a Kardashian problem: Users revolt against app ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTati Bruening was once the textbook example of an Instagram user. Since the pandemic, she has been building her career as a photographer on the platform and attracted hundreds of thousands of followers in the process. But recently, her relationship with Instagram started to change.\n\nOn Monday, Bruening shared a post on the platform calling to “Make Instagram Instagram again.” She told CNN Business that she was scrolling the app and felt frustrated by the lack of content she was seeing from accounts she followed in the wake of recent updates prioritizing recommended posts and videos from its Reels product.\n\n“I was seeing a post from my friend underneath three Reels and a recommended post that was six days old,” she said. As she put it in her post: “Stop trying to be TikTok I just want to see cute photos of my friends.”\n\nHer post blew up. By Tuesday morning, it had more than 1.7 million likes, thanks in part to shares by two of the most influential figures on the platform: Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. The famous half-sisters are among the most-followed accounts on Instagr am, with 360 million and 326 million followers, respectively, and their opinions carry big weight in the world of social media. A February 2018 tweet from Jenner criticizing a Snapchat redesign was credited with wiping out $1.3 billion from the company’s value in a week.\n\nThe attention to Bruening’s post reflects the growing backlash against recent updates to the Instagram platform, which boast more than 1 billion users. To beat back the competitive threat of TikTok — whose discovery algorithm is viewed as its great competitive advantage — Instagram has started showing users a much greater proportion of recommended content from accounts that they don’t follow versus posts from their friends. It has also prioritized video content over the photos it is known for. The platform has been testing showing full-screen posts, much like TikTok, as well.\n\nThe issue has arguably been brewing for years. Since 2020, the company has been experimenting with showing users more “suggested posts” in their feeds. Recommended content and ads now make up a significant portion of the Instagram feed, which often pigeonholes users into certain content categories (such as recipes or relationship advice) in a way that sometimes seems to disregard whether they actually follow such accounts.\n\nThe latest dust-up around Instagram comes at a fragile time for parent company Meta. The company is grappling with an aging and stagnating user base on its flagship Facebook platform, and Instagram is largely seen as the best bet of its family of apps to maintain and grow the crucial younger audience. But Meta, like many older players in the social media world, is facing steep competition from TikTok and is fighting to gain traction in its attempts to copy it. While Instagram users are somewhat more likely to open the app daily, TikTok users spend an average of about 45 more minutes per day on the app than people do on Instagram, according to a report from research firm Sensor Tower for the second quarter of 2022. In a February call with Wall Street analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Instagram Reels “face a competitor in TikTok that is a lot bigger, so it will take a while to … catch up there.”\n\nAt the same time, Meta is relying on profits from Instagram and its other apps to help fund its investment in building a future version of the internet it calls the “metaverse.” And the company, which is set to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, may see a slowdown in spending on ads, its core business, amid rising inflation and recession fears.\n\nMeta’s stock fell nearly 3% Tuesday after the growing backlash from the Kardashians and others.\n\n“The problem for Meta is that nothing is good right now,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. “Instagram is meant to be the Meta asset to exploit, to address the younger market, so it’s natural to me that they’re using Instagram as the way to respond to the competitive threat of TikTok.”\n\nMeta has run this playbook before. In 2016, months before Snapchat’s parent company made its Wall Street debut, Instagram copied one of the messaging app’s signature features, Stories. Instagram, soon reached more users with its version of the feature than Snapchat did. But its efforts to copy TikTok with Reels have arguably proven to be more difficult.\n\nMany have pointed out that videos on Reels are often just old TikTok videos — sometimes shared weeks after they first went viral on TikTok, and occasionally with the TikTok logo still attached. In some cases, users will share a still photo set to music as a Reel in an effort to rank higher on the platform. Instagram, for its part, has been trying to incentivize users to make original Reels, with creator fund programs and by featuring them prominently in-feed. The company is now also testing sharing all videos shorter than 15 minutes as Reels.\n\nTo be sure, Instagram is not the only platform prioritizing video and recommended content as it seeks to keep up with TikTok, which last year surpassed 1 billion monthly active users. Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have all also taken steps in that direction.\n\n“The viewpoint is that this is like mobile, meaning it’s an evolutionary change in consumption on the internet,” Forte said. “What choice does Facebook have? It would be nearly impossible to buy TikTok, which was the old playbook, so now they have to try to innovate.”\n\nFor creators like Breuning who built their livelihoods on Instagram, the changes feel especially painful, given its origin as a photo app that catered to artists and photographers.\n\n“It feels wrong to switch the algorithm on creators that have made a living and contributed to the community, forcing them to change their entire content direction and lifestyle to serve a new algorithm,” Bruening wrote in a change.org petition calling on Instagram to “Stop trying to be TikTok!” It has garnered more than 150,000 signatures in four days.\n\nInstagram did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. However, Instagram head Adam Mosseri addressed the criticism in a video post on the platform Tuesday.\n\n“We’re experimenting with a number of different changes to the app and so we’re hearing a lot of concerns from all of you,” he said, acknowledging complaints about the shift to video and the increase in recommended content. “We’re going to continue to support photos, they’re part of our heritage. … That said, I need to be honest: I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.”\n\nMosseri continued: “If you look at what people share on Instagram, that’s shifting more and more to videos over time. If you look at what people like and consume and view on Instagram, that’s also shifting more and more to video over time, even if we’re not changing anything. So we’re going to have to lean into that shift while continuing to support photos.”\n\nMosseri also warned that the full screen video feature test is “not yet good” and has only rolled out to a small percentage of users. And he pointed to the option Instagram launched earlier this year for users to toggle the platform to a chronological feed of posts from only accounts they follow.\n\nBut that explanation wasn’t enough to silence the criticisms. Some users sounded off in the comments about feeling like they had no choice but to start making more videos if they wanted the platform’s algorithm to surface their content. Others suggested that if the platform became too much like TikTok, they’d be inclined to simply pick one of the apps to use rather than both.\n\n“People do VIDEOS because we have no reach on our photos!!” fashion creator Alina Tanasa (@fabmusealina) said in a comment on Mosseri’s video. “As a content creator I need and want each and with photos you cut all the reach and you promote only videos. So it’s not us, it’s you that are changing everything and are afraid of TikTok.”\n\nMakeup influencer James Charles, who has nearly 23 million Instagram followers, added in a comment: “I understand that every business has to evolve, compete, and please investors, but Instagram is losing the competition and has lost its identity along the way. … We’re upset because we CARE about this app and the communities we’ve been able to create/join on here, but I’m genuinely worried that if something doesn’t change, there will be no community left.”\n\nIf there’s a silver lining for Instagram, however, it’s that there are few other photo-first apps out there, making it easier to criticize Instagram than leave it, especially for those who have built a life and a livelihood on it.\n\n“Me personally,” Breuning said, “I love Instagram and I don’t plan on leaving Instagram anytime soon.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Jennifer Korn", "Clare Duffy", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/tech/stock-hunting/index.html", "title": "A new crop of shopping tools aims to help consumers beat the ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA few days after Christmas, Aaron Worley and his wife began feeling ill.\n\nFearing they may have contracted Covid-19 over the holidays, Worley, a 32-year-old quality assurance tester from Las Vegas, joined millions of other Americans in a desperate search — “rush mode,” he called it — for rapid test kits that were evaporating from store shelves. Every place he tried was sold out.\n\nThen Worley looked at his Twitter (TWTR) feed. An account he followed known as Wario64, which normally focuses on restocks and deals on video game consoles, had just blasted out a link to Walmart (WMT)’s website, where an undetermined number of Covid tests were now back in stock for around $20 apiece. Clicking the link, Worley rushed to place an order in hopes of beating out the masses — and was rewarded moments later by a Walmart (WMT) confirmation email. Winning the supply-chain lottery felt surreal, Worley said, even if Walmart (WMT) later had to cancel his shipment due to other inventory issues.\n\n“I’ve never been a gambler, but I can absolutely say there’s a thrill to getting something that you know seconds later will be gone,” he said. “It’s almost indescribable. It’s the opposite of FOMO [the fear of missing out]. There’s a huge dose of serotonin the second you get that ‘order completed’ screen.”\n\nWorley is one of a growing number of consumers who’ve turned to a mix of social media sleuths and dedicated product-tracking services for an edge in the exhausting, demoralizing experience that is shopping for almost anything during the pandemic. Manufacturing delays, labor shortages and shipping disruptions have contributed to difficulties finding many in-demand products. And for some of the hottest items, the problem has been exacerbated by profit-seeking scalpers and bots that snap up scarce supplies before ordinary people can get their chance.\n\nWhere people once fought over luxuries like concert tickets and Supreme drops, now they’re fighting for household essentials and medical supplies. The grayed-out “purchase” button on websites everywhere is emblematic of a consumer era when virtually everything is at our fingertips, but also perpetually just out of reach.\n\nIn response, a small but dedicated community of programmers, journalists and social media content creators has sprung up to announce whenever a retailer such as Amazon or Walmart have restocked, or “dropped,” more product. Over the course of the pandemic, these stock hunters have devised ever more sophisticated methods for learning about impending drops earlier and earlier — and for notifying what has become a loyal following numbering in the hundreds of thousands for some accounts.\n\nDemand for their services is so high, some have transformed stock-hunting into a full-time job, earning a bit of cash every time a user clicks an alert or pays for a subscription feature. Every in-stock notification acts as a dinner bell ringing across the internet, prompting a mad scramble as shoppers try to shave precious seconds off their efforts to secure a Covid test, a game console or a popular children’s toy. For many, it’s even become its own form of entertainment.\n\n“Just getting the gaming console is kind of a game in itself,” said Marc Holgate, founder of the tracking app HotStock.io.\n\nAs long as supplies remain tight, the incentive for shoppers to turn to these tools will continue to grow. And the more people flock to these tools, the harder it may become for other shoppers to avoid using them for fear of missing out on an important shopping advantage.\n\nFrom Hot Stock\n\nThe rise of professional stock hunters\n\nWhat many widely followed stock hunters have in common is that they began as ordinary consumers themselves, looking for a coveted item.\n\nMatt Swider, a New York-based technology journalist, had been searching high and low for a PS5 last February when he was finally selected for a chance to buy one from Sony’s virtual queue — only to be met with an error message when he submitted his American Express credit card. The error message wouldn’t go away, even when he tried a Visa card. Helplessly, Swider watched as his 10-minute window to make a purchase ticked to a close.\n\n“So I tweeted about that,” he said. “‘Don’t try [American Express], anybody,’ at 21,000 Twitter followers at the time.”\n\nSony made another batch of PS5s available the following day. Swider tweeted about that, too, and he got a few messages from followers thanking him for the tip. A few days later, the queue opened again. Each time Swider told his followers of an opportunity to get in line, he attracted more followers — 100 one day, 1,000 the next. A year later, Swider — who quit his old job as the US editor of Techradar, a tech blog — now talks to more than 1 million Twitter followers about restocks of game consoles and graphics cards.\n\nAnd his followers talk back. Swider estimates that he receives 2,000 Twitter messages a day. On a home computer setup stretching across six monitors, Swider will usually sift through about 1,000 messages per day.\n\n🚨28 mins: PS5 + Xbox Series X restock 🌟 Walmart\n\n\n\nPS5 Digital https://t.co/znn5frdozz\n\nPS5 Disc https://t.co/fOQxCw6PLC\n\nXbox Series X https://t.co/rDu9ZnzWCI\n\n\n\n🔴Live stream @ the BEACH (I can't believe it's working): https://t.co/5i7cPaAzPE\n\n\n\n⬇️Directions: https://t.co/AljQ8odm1G — Matt Swider (tracking PS5 / Xbox / GPU restock) (@mattswider) January 13, 2022\n\nSome of Swider’s most valuable tips come from these followers, many of whom, he said, happen to work at Best Buy or Target and have inside knowledge on when a drop is about to occur. In journalistic fashion, Swider describes these as his most trusted and reliable sources. Out of the thousands of messages he gets every day, a tiny fraction — perhaps five, he said — will contain useful information about an upcoming restock that he can vet and develop into an alert.\n\n“Everyone from managers to heads to low-level employees will reach out to me, saying, ‘You helped me get a PlayStation 5, and I want to help others,’” Swider said. Sometimes, Swider also swaps tips and discusses scammer activity in a private group chat for fellow restock accounts he started on Twitter last year.\n\nIn December alone, an average of 16,000 people per week clicked on Swider’s links to game console restocks. Swider declined to say how much revenue he earns from affiliate links, but he said that is only one of the ways he hopes to earn a living from stock-hunting. Swider also runs a newsletter for tech deals and product reviews on Substack called The Shortcut, which launched last November and has 100,000 subscribers — some of whom are free subscribers, and some of whom pay $5 a month or $50 a year. Swider said his goal for 2022 is to expand into coverage of other electronics such as mini projectors and devices from Samsung and LG.\n\nSwider isn’t the only one looking beyond gaming products. The stock-hunting community has increasingly focused on tracking a wider range of consumer goods, including toys, hygiene products and fashion items. Face masks and toilet paper have been popular items, for obvious reasons. So have Pokémon cards; Jordan- or Yeezy-branded shoes; toys from the children’s show “Gabby’s Dollhouse”; a minifridge shaped like an Xbox Series X; and the Death Star Lego set, just to name a few.\n\nThe stock-hunting community is moving beyond gaming products and has increasingly focused on tracking a wider range of consumer goods, Phil Barker/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated technology\n\nIf Swider’s strategy depends primarily on shoe-leather reporting, others in the community take a more technical approach.\n\nAt first, many began with simple programs that mimicked, in an automated way, what a live human would do: Load up a retailer’s website in a browser, then look for an add-to-cart button. Most of the time, the button would be grayed out and inactive. But if the button changed color to reflect a restock, the program would blast a notification to its Twitter followers or on messaging apps like Discord.\n\nWhile that basic method is still widely used, some stock hunters have since adopted more advanced tactics in a never-ending bid to shave seconds off of reaction times.\n\nStockDrops, a stock-hunting community of 125,000 that organizes primarily on Discord, can peer directly into Best Buy’s product database using the retailer’s publicly available API, or application programming interface. As soon as the StockDrops program detects a change in Best Buy’s inventory, it sends an alert to subscribers — no browser scripts necessary.\n\nEnrique Morell, the creator of StockDrops, is a full-time physics graduate student at the University of California Santa Barbara. He usually gets up to attend classes or do schoolwork from about 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. But as soon as he’s finished, Morell throws himself into coding for StockDrops and works through the night.\n\nThe project employs a dozen volunteers, primarily to moderate the online social space that’s built up around the tool. The small-time nature of the project has forced Morell to turn down some popular requests.\n\n“We’ve been asked to track Pokemon cards, that’s a hot market,” Morell said. “We’ve been asked to track Barbies. … We’ve been asked to add auto-checkout features. We’ve tried it a bit, but I’m not happy with it. It’s very complicated work, and something that doesn’t really fit with our volunteer jobs.”\n\nStockDrops, a stock-hunting community of 125,000, organizes primarily on Discord and can peer directly into Best Buy's product database. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nHotStock, meanwhile, is trying to get ahead by using artificial intelligence to predict when an item is likely to come back in stock. Holgate, the founder, is based in the UK and said the app has benefited from nearby Cambridge University, which produces a steady stream of job candidates with degrees in machine learning and AI.\n\n“There are certain clues we can detect, based on previous stock drops,” Holgate said. “We can predict a drop before it happens so that we can notify people.”\n\n“Everyone’s doing it a different way,” he added. “There is no standardized way. It’s easy to get into doing this, but it’s very hard to do very well.”\n\nLike some other stock hunters, HotStock has direct business partnerships with some retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy, that will give HotStock a heads-up when a drop is incoming. Holgate declined to say whether or how much he pays for the partnerships, and declined to provide specific audience figures for the app, but said HotStock has seen a “significant amount of growth in the past year and a half” and has millions of users.\n\nAmazon, Best Buy and other large retailers did not respond to requests for comment on their relationship with stock-hunting services.\n\nBeating the bots\n\nThe growing sophistication of stock-hunting apps and accounts is a direct response to the rise of bots, automated programs designed to swoop in on drops faster than real people can place their own orders. Many of the bots work on behalf of price-gougers who, taking advantage of high aftermarket prices, seek a profit by flipping high-demand goods on platforms like Ebay or Amazon.\n\nBots and scalpers are a problem that retailers themselves have spent months battling, with mixed results. The problem is even on Congress’s radar: In November, ahead of the holiday shopping season, a group of Democratic lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a bill to stop what they called “Grinch bots.”\n\nSome retailers have introduced digital queues to slow down the checkout process. Others may sell popular items as part of larger product bundles that contain less desirable items scalpers can’t resell as easily.\n\nJake Randall is a YouTuber who creates livestreams of himself trying to sign up for game consoles when they become available. Courtesy Jake Randall\n\nA Walmart spokesperson said the company is committed to giving customers “a fair chance to purchase the items they want.” An online queue, along with early access to items for paying Walmart+ subscribers, helps manage the supply of products, the company added.\n\n“Our cyber security team continues to work with tech, product and business teams to understand the demand and timing for inventory drops and how we can add a level of security to address bot traffic while maintaining a positive shopping experience,” Walmart said in a statement. “We also audit purchases and cancel bot orders if we find that they have completed a purchase.”\n\nBut, Holgate said, bots and scalpers are getting worse, not better. When retailers roll out one countermeasure, the scalpers work to circumvent it, resulting in an endless game of cat and mouse. And, he said, consumers get squeezed in the middle.\n\nThough stock-hunting tools sometimes rely on similar technology and principles as the scalpers, the stock-hunters CNN interviewed said they are nothing alike.\n\nFor one thing, they argue, stock-hunting services don’t make actual purchases like bots do — they just tell users about drops and leave consumers to make the purchases themselves (though some acknowledge that scalpers could be using their own tools against them).\n\nFor another, scalpers operate on a completely different scale. According to Morell, some scalper groups charge hundreds of dollars for access to their tools and communications, whereas StockDrops, HotStock and similar services are free and run on donations, optional subscriptions and affiliate link revenue.\n\nAs a result, Morell said, scalpers “have way more money to spend on development to beat you on speed [and] on reverse engineering” the retailer websites.\n\nA new culture emerges\n\nIn addition to helping people find products, some of these stock-hunting services can also help people find something more meaningful.\n\nStockDrop’s Discord server began as a place to get restock notifications, but it has since evolved into a social hub, with separate chatrooms for discussions on music, politics and even fast food. Some members have met up and become friends in real life, Morell said.\n\nBut perhaps no one embodies the soul of the restock community like Jake Randall, a content creator who has built an audience of 175,000 subscribers on YouTube and 388,000 followers on Twitter since 2019. To listen to Randall talk about his audience is to get a peek into what may be one of the most wholesome corners of the internet.\n\nRandall suffers from cystic fibrosis, a genetic illness that hampers the body’s breathing and digestive systems. In a video pinned to the top of his YouTube page, Randall says he initially thought the progressive disease would kill him. But in 2019, a new treatment gave him renewed hope and more energy that allowed him to start streaming on YouTube. Much of Randall’s content shows him sitting before a computer with multiple browser tabs pulled up, documenting his (and his followers’) attempts to leap on console deals when they arise.\n\nIn an interview, Randall seemingly could not help but gush for minutes at a time about his viewers, many of whom came for tips about PS5 restocks but stayed for the community he had built. The live chat beside his videos is often filled with messages of thanks and well-wishes.\n\nToward the end of one marathon 16-hour livestream, Randall said one woman left a chat message saying she’d been trying unsuccessfully to buy an Xbox for her cancer-stricken son.\n\n“I saw that message and I just knew in my heart that I didn’t need mine,” Randall said. He looked up the woman on Facebook and offered her the Halo-branded Xbox he had claimed. But she refused to accept unless she could pay him for it.\n\nAs they were talking, other viewers in the live chat had been donating money to Randall on the woman’s behalf so that she would not have to pay out of pocket. Rather than accept the donations, Randall decided to redirect the money to the American Cancer Society. Other people in the chat then donated to the organization, too.\n\nFor Randall, the experience is representative of what the job has become. What began as a way to help others get through a pandemic-fueled supply shortage has turned into much more — a way to find the humanity in other people as he battles his disease.\n\n“It’s nothing I can take credit for,” he said. “I feel so lucky that these people with good hearts find me. I feel like I’m the one getting so much help.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/tech/twitter-edit-button-test/index.html", "title": "Twitter is finally testing an edit button | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter years of users clamoring for such a feature, Twitter is finally testing edited tweets.\n\nTwitter said in — where else? — a tweet Thursday morning that some users may start seeing edited tweets in their feed because it is testing the long-awaited edit button.\n\n“This is happening and you’ll be okay,” the company said.\n\nIn a Thursday blog post, the company said edited tweets are being tested internally and that the feature would expand to subscribers of its paid Twitter Blue service later this month. The test will first roll out to Twitter Blue subscribers in New Zealand, with Australia, Canada and the US to follow, according to the company. Users outside the test group will also be able to see edited tweets on the platform.\n\nTwitter said in April that it had been testing an edit feature for a year, and that it would be available to Twitter Blue subscribers within months. The announcement came the same day the company announced that it would add Elon Musk to its board, and after he polled his followers about whether they’d like an edit button on the platform. When it confirmed the edit feature was in the works, Twitter also said, “no, we didn’t get the idea from a poll.”\n\n(Musk later pulled out of the board seat offer, agreed to buy Twitter outright, moved to terminate the acquisition deal and now is fighting a lawsuit from Twitter that seeks to compel him to follow through with the deal.)\n\nAlthough many people have for years been calling on Twitter to add an edit button — which rivals like Facebook and Instagram offer — others have raised concerns about the potential implications of such a feature. Safety experts asked, for example: What if a harmless tweet went viral and then was edited to include harassment or misinformation, increasing the reach of a tweet that might otherwise not have spread?\n\nTwitter said in its Thursday blog post that in this test, tweets will be able to be edited “a few times” for up to 30 minutes after they are first posted. Edited tweets will appear with an icon, label and timestamp to make it obvious they have been modified, and users can click through to a tweet’s “edit history” to see past versions.\n\n“Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues.

Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz are vying for votes in Pennsylvania in a race that is considered the Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat in the Senate, with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey retiring at the end of the term. During the debate, Fetterman’s delivery was at times halting and repetitive, dropping words during answers and occasionally losing his train of thought. He is currently recovering from a stroke he suffered in May. Much of the attention heading into the debate focused on how Fetterman’s struggle with auditory processing and speech could impact the conversation against Oz, a celebrity doctor who rose to fame by hosting a daily television show for years. But the debate ultimately emphasized the deep policy differences between the candidates, with the two sparring over energy policy, abortion and the economy.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe Justice Department is asking a federal judge to force two of former President Donald Trump’s White House lawyers to testify about their conversations with the former President, according to three people familiar with the investigation. The move to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin just last week is part of a set of secret court proceedings. Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations about the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators. Separately, Hope Hicks, who served as Trump’s communications director, is being called back for a formal interview with the House select committee investigating the insurrection, a source familiar with the details told CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Most aggressive subpoena I've ever seen': Honig on Jan 6 committee's latest move 04:23 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Iran\n\nAnti-government protests have gripped Iran since the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being taken by morality police to a “re-education center” for apparently not wearing her hijab properly. Today marks the 40th day since her death and in Iranian culture, the 40-day mark of a person’s passing is an important day of mourning. According to Iran’s state-run media IRNA, Amini’s family will not hold a gathering for her passing today in an effort to quell the violence. “Considering the circumstances and in order to avoid any unfortunate problem, we will not hold a ceremony marking the 40th day,” the family’s statement said, according to IRNA. On Sunday, President Biden threw his support behind the demonstrators in the country, saying the US stands with the “brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.” In response, Iran said it will sue the US, alleging “direct involvement” in the protests.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter explains why journalists are being arrested for covering protest 02:45 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Voting machines\n\nTwo counties in the Western battleground states of Arizona and Nevada are moving forward with plans to hand count ballots in this year’s consequential midterm elections – a sign of the deep distrust of electronic vote tallying machines in some pockets of the country. Officials in the two communities still plan to use machines for the tallies, but experts worry the additional hand counts could result in two different totals and could further undermine public trust in elections. Critics also say hand counting thousands of ballots is not likely to produce accurate results. Meanwhile, local election workers are leaving their posts in droves due to continued threats and harassment as the November midterms draw closer. In some places, the exodus has opened the door to election deniers seeking roles in county elections offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Woman confronts armed man near ballot drop box 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n5. LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is rolling out new features to catch bots and fake accounts on its site. While often thought of as a tamer social platform for professionals and job seekers, LinkedIn is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated bad actors on the site. The professional networking company has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers for applying for high-profile job openings. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. The company told CNN Business this week that the new features will soon help users evaluate the authenticity of accounts before engaging with them.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nBaby beaver builds makeshift dam to keep her nemesis out\n\nA cute beaver is going viral for her gnaw-ledge on how to fend off enemies.

A criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Secret Service alleged John Andrew Bazor Jr., 37, of Mobile called the White House switchboard on July 10 and made the death threat. He was arrested Monday in Mobile. Prosecutors on Wednesday asked a judge to order a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether Bazor is competent to stand trial, WALA-TV reported. The report said prosecutors cited the man’s outbursts during a probable cause hearing earlier in the week and his resistance to mental health counselors as reasons for the request. Bazor’s attorney, Gordon Armstrong, said he supports the call for a mental health evaluation, adding the prosecution’s filing raises serious questions about whether his client is criminally liable because of his possible mental health issues.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: An evacuation order for about 65 residents of a subdivision near the community of Anderson because of a wildfire has been lifted, Denali Borough Mayor Clay Walker said Wednesday. The evacuation order went into place June 28 and was lifted Tuesday, he said. “It’s been a long haul,” Walker said. The fire destroyed about 30 structures but that includes just one, year-round residence, he said. The structures burned also included eight or nine cabins and a variety of other buildings, including sheds, garages and one shipping container that held about $100,000 of building materials, he said. The fire burned nearly 113 square miles near Anderson, which is about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks. Rains have doused the fire, and as of Wednesday, it was listed as 56% contained with full containment expected within the next 10 days, fire officials said. Lightning started the fire June 21.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Virgin Galactic said it has selected the Phoenix suburb of Mesa as the site where it will assemble its next class of rocket ships.

They said the facility will be capable of producing up to six spaceships a year and bring hundreds of aerospace engineering and manufacturing jobs to Mesa. Virgin Galactic officials said the Delta-class suborbital spaceplanes will be designed to fly weekly, supporting the company’s target of 400 flights annually from Spaceport America in New Mexico. The first of the spaceships is expected to start payload flights in late 2025, with private astronaut flights in 2026.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: Electricity is expected to be fully restored to homes and businesses Thursday, three days after a summer storm knocked out power in the city. The storm late Sunday brought high winds that damaged more than 60 utility poles, said Mayor Daniel Rogers. Power was restored Wednesday night in all parts of the city. Paris has its own electricity service, and contractors have arrived to help crews with the work. There have been no reports of injuries from the storm or heat-related illnesses at homes without air conditioning since it hit, Rogers said. A cooling center was opened at the Paris High School cafeteria. Additional construction work is needed in places where power lines and poles have been repaired, Rogers said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A mountain lion that was part of a National Park Service study was fatally struck by a vehicle on a highway near the Santa Monica Mountains. The 2-year-old male cougar, dubbed P-89, was found dead early Monday on a shoulder along U.S. 101 in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area said in a statement. P-89 was outfitted with a radio tracking collar by biologists who are studying how the big cats live in habitat fragmented by urban sprawl, barriers that limit genetic diversity and with hazards ranging from poisons to roads and freeways. The statement said P-89 was the fourth mountain lion in the study killed by vehicles this year within the research area, which includes the Santa Monica range, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Verdugo Mountains and Griffith Park in Los Angeles. P-89 was in a litter of three during the summer of 2020. P-89’s brother, P-90, is still alive and successfully crossed U.S. 101 near Camarillo last month, leaving the Santa Monica Mountains, the statement said. P-90’s GPS locations showed he has been wandering in Los Padres National Forest. The whereabouts of their sister, P-88, is unknown.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:A grass fire north of the Budweiser brewery was quickly extinguished Wednesday afternoon. Poudre Fire Authority firefighters responded to the grass fire just before 12:40 p.m. and extinguished it in 5 minutes, Capt. Kristine Reinking said. The fire burned about 500 feet in a ditch north of the Budweiser brewery on the west side of Interstate 25. No structures were threatened and no injuries were reported, spokesperson Annie Bierbower said. The fire started by a transformer explosion, Reinking said. Parts of Wellington are experiencing power outages. An Xcel Energy crew arrived on scene shortly after the fire was out and will work to bypass the section that was burned and replace the pole and transformer impacted, Reinking said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: The Office of the Inspector General has launched an investigation into the death of a New York man who became unresponsive while in the custody of Manchester police. Joseph Torrice of Dutchess County, New York, was arrested July 8 on drug possession charges and was held after police discovered he also was wanted in New York state on charges of larceny and burglary. He was found on the floor of his cell July 10 after suffering some type of medical episode, Manchester police said. The office released a 13-minute video Wednesday showing Torrice rolling out of the bed in his cell and later becoming motionless on the floor. About 10 minutes later, police entered the cell and dragged Torrice by his feet to the entrance, where they appeared to check his pulse before removing him from view. Torrice was transported to Hartford Hospital, where he was treated in the intensive care unit, before dying July 18.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A handful of Delaware gun rights groups filed a federal lawsuit seeking an injunction against recently passed legislation that bans assault weapons. In the final months of the legislative session, Democrats passed a sweeping package of gun reform bills that also included limiting high-capacity magazines and increasing the purchasing age from 18 to 21 for most firearms. The bills were introduced after recent mass shootings, specifically the shooting at an Uvalde, Texas elementary school. The Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association filed the suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on Wednesday afternoon. They were joined by the Bridgeville Rifle and Pistol Club, the Delaware Association of Federal Firearms Licensees and the Delaware Rifle and Pistol Club. The suit specifically focuses on HB 450, which makes it illegal to make, sell, purchase or possess assault-style weapons, including AK-47s and AR-15s. The legislation does grandfather currently owned weapons and protects owners from being misidentified as those breaking the law, and grants certain exceptions for law enforcement and military members. The 92-page lawsuit argued the legislation violates the Second Amendment, as well as other constitutional rights. A spokeswoman for Gov. John Carney declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Police said a cyclist died after she was struck and killed by a Mack truck in Northwest D.C. on Wednesday morning, WUSA-TV reported. The Metropolitan Police Department said the victim was hit at the intersection of 21st and I streets NW, nearby The George Washington University campus, about 8 a.m. The victim, identified as 40-year-old Shawn O’Donnell, was transported to a local hospital by medical personnel where she died.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade School Board, which oversees Florida’s largest school district, reversed its decision to adopt a new sex education book, with some in the majority saying the material is not age-appropriate for students in middle and high school. The 5-4 vote followed an emotionally charged board meeting on Wednesday, with some members of the public being escorted from the room, the Miami Herald reported. It’s not known how the nation’s fourth-largest public school system, with 334,000 students, will comply with state law requiring students to receive sexual education. Choosing, ordering and distributing a new textbook could take months. The board adopted the textbook in April on a 5-3 vote, but then its material was challenged by some parents who cited the parental rights law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in March.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFort Gordon: The U.S. military Thursday identified a soldier killed by a lightning strike at Fort Gordon as a 41-year-old Army reservist assigned to a medical team that performs emergency surgery in combat zones. Sgt. 1st Class Michael D. Clark of Springfield, Massachusetts, served for 22 years on active duty and as a reservist and had deployed four times to Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Army Reserve said in a statement. It said Clark died and nine other soldiers were injured Wednesday when lightning struck the group during a training exercise at Fort Gordon. Clark was rushed to the Army post’s hospital along with the injured soldiers. All nine survivors were in good condition Thursday, the Army Reserve said. Clark and eight of the injured soldiers were assigned to the 933rd Forward Resuscitative Surgical Company, which performs emergency surgery and other urgent treatment on wounded soldiers in combat. The unit is based in Paducah, Kentucky. “Sgt. 1st Class Clark was a loving husband, father, and a patriot who deeply loved our country,” the company’s commander, Maj. Stephen W. Rhinehart, said in a statement. “His leadership, knowledge, experience, and love for his fellow soldiers was immeasurable.” Soldiers from the 933rd were visiting Fort Gordon for an annual training exercise for medical units to improve their skills in the field.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former county official admitted in court that he used his position to scam a program meant to address the lack of affordable housing. Alan Rudo, who was a Housing and Community Development Specialist on the Big Island, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. “My client is taking full responsibility for whatever he did and he’s cooperating with the government,” Rudo’s defense attorney Gary Singh told the Associated Press on Tuesday. Rudo faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 when he is sentenced in October.\n\nIdaho\n\nPost Falls: Authorities recovered the body of a 14-year-old Washington boy who went missing on the Spokane River in northern Idaho. Kootenai County sheriff’s officials said the teen from Spokane was with his family at Corbin Park near Post Falls on Saturday and was last seen alive playing near the shore. When first responders arrived at the park, the teen had not been seen for more than an hour. Some of his clothing was found near the water, and a dive team started searching. The boy’s body was found about 20 feet from shore in 10 feet of water. His name has not been released.\n\nIllinois\n\nEast Peoria: The city will add a splash pad and an amphitheater to Levee Park next year, paid for in part with a $400,000 grant from the state. The Open Space Land Acquisition and Development grant will allow the East Peoria Community Foundation and the City of East Peoria to move forward with the addition. Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced July 8 that 87 parks in 31 counties statewide will receive a total of $30.3 million in grant money. Grants can provide up to one-half of a project’s funds. City of East Peoria Director of Planning and Community Development Ty Livingston said construction of the splash pad and amphitheater could begin as early as next spring. The beginning of the project will signify Phase Three in the development of Levee Park. Livingston said he hopes construction will be completed by next summer.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette: A man who ran into a burning home and saved five people, including a 6-year-old girl with whom he jumped out of a second-floor window, said he’s no hero and the serious injuries he suffered were “all worth it.” Nick Bostic, 25, of Lafayette was driving early July 11 in the city when he saw a house in flames. He stopped and ran inside to alert its residents. “I slammed on the brakes, I turned the steering wheel, I did a 180. I ran into the back of the house and I was yelling for anybody. Four faces, three or four faces, came out the top,” he told WLFI-TV. An 18-year-old woman was in the home babysitting her three siblings, ages 1, 6 and 13, along with a 13-year-old friend of the 13-year-old sibling, while the siblings’ parents were out playing darts, The Washington Post reported. Bostic said the 18-year-old was able to get three of the children out, but she told him one child was still missing, prompting him to search the smoke-filled home for that child. Because of the dense smoke, he said his only option was to exit through a second-floor window. Bostic punched out the glass and jumped to safety with the 6-year-old girl in his arms. He suffered multiple injuries but the girl only suffered a minor cut to her foot. After an officer helps Bostic to a safer spot across the street, a tourniquet is applied to his arm after he lies down in the grass. Bostic, who suffered smoke inhalation in addition to his arm injury and other wounds, was airlifted to an Indianapolis hospital and discharged two days later. He said he’s not a hero, and just did what he would have wanted someone to do for him and his family if their home was on fire. A GoFundMe page set up for Bostic to help pay his hospital and medical bills had raised more than $470,000 by Wednesday afternoon, far surpassing its $100,000 goal.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The main terminal at Dubuque’s regional airport has been renamed to honor a Black World War II fighter pilot from the eastern Iowa city. The family of the late Robert Martin, city leaders and those who sought the change gathered Tuesday for a ribbon cutting at the Dubuque Regional Airport to commemorate the new name, the Capt. Robert L. Martin Terminal, the Telegraph Herald reported. Martin, who died in 2018 at the age of 99, was a native of Dubuque who joined the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II and flew missions with the Tuskegee Airmen – the U.S. Army’s first Black aviators. During the war, Martin flew numerous missions in Europe and was shot down while flying over Yugoslavia. For his service, Martin was awarded several medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Purple Heart and, later, the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A new poll showed a close race in the passage of a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the state Constitution, set to be the first time voters in any state weigh in on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned last month by the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the survey, conducted by the Kansas City, Mo., firm co/efficient and first reported by the political news site FiveThirtyEight, 47% of voters said they will vote for the amendment and 43% said they will oppose it. The poll has a 2.7% margin-of-error, meaning the race is likely to remain close in the run-up to the Aug. 2 vote. It is the first public polling released on the amendment to date, with both campaigns hesitant to share their internal survey data. Of those polled, 49% said they agreed with the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, and 46% were against.\n\nKentucky\n\nTyner: Elected officials celebrated the completion of a $220 million highway project in eastern Kentucky that improved the route for three rural counties to Interstate 75 in London. The final stretch of the new Kentucky 30 straightened the route between Tyner in Jackson County to Travellers Rest in Owsley County. Gov. Andy Beshear and Rep. Hal Rogers joined other officials Wednesday in Tyner to mark the completion of the 20-year transportation project. The new wider highway stretches from Booneville to London. Beshear unveiled signage naming a portion of the final segment in Jackson County after former state Rep. Marie Rader.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The Lafayette Parish Council gave Mayor-President Josh Guillory preliminary approval to enter public-private partnerships for parish facilities as Guillory aims to build a parish jail without increasing taxes. The council voted 4-1 on a resolution giving the first-term mayor-president authority to develop partnerships for up to 40 years at $10.5 million a year, provided the council has final authority to spend any money. AB Rubin, the lone Democrat, voted against. Guillory announced plans to seek a public-private deal to build a jail in a short video released Monday night. Although details were sparse in the recording, he said the partnership plan would allow the parish to build a jail without passing new taxes and keep Sheriff Mark Garber in charge of operating the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Chipotle is closing its store in Augusta that had been leading efforts to unionize the chain. Employees filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board in June asking to hold a union election at the store. It was the first of the Mexican food chain’s stores to file such a petition, according to the NLRB. The NLRB had scheduled a hearing Tuesday on Chipotle’s objections to the union election. But early Tuesday, Chipotle announced it was permanently closing the store. Labor organizers said they will fight the closure. They said Chipotle is retaliating for their unionization efforts and trying to send a message to other stores that might try to unionize. But Chipotle said the closure was the result of staffing issues and not related to union activity. Chipotle said the Augusta store had been closed to the public since June 17 because of staffing issues. The company said it was facing “excessive” absences and lack of availability from existing staff and was having a hard time finding managers for the store. Chipotle said the store’s workers will receive severance pay and assistance finding new jobs.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:New coronavirus cases leaped in Maryland in the week ending Sunday, rising 24% as 11,317 cases were reported. The previous week had 9,127 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nHadley: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is going an extra step to protect birds by upgrading its northeast headquarters to prevent bird collisions. The agency said it will install markings on exterior windows of its regional office in Hadley. The markings will be arranged in a pattern designed to alert birds to the presence of glass windows before it’s too late. The agency also programmed its interior lights to switch off at night to reduce the risk of attracting birds. In its announcement, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it hoped to lead by example and encouraged private property owners to do their part. Turning off unused lights at night will reduce bird collisions while also saving energy, agency officials noted. Birds often don’t recognize glass windows and can be tricked by reflections of sky or physical surroundings. According to the service, nearly 1 billion birds collide with glass in the U.S. each year. Many are killed or seriously injured.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the final piece of a $76 billion state budget into law Wednesday, vetoing money that Republicans funneled toward anti-abortion causes including groups that run “pregnancy resource centers” focused on persuading pregnant women to give birth. Negotiators met behind the scenes for weeks to develop the budget proposal and announced a deal in late June. But they couldn’t agree on how to lower taxes, which is possible after a flood of federal money and anticipated higher tax revenue. Whitmer, a Democrat, has called for targeted cuts, and Republicans want broader ones, including lower individual and corporate income tax rates. The governor’s vetoes largely focused on anti-abortion causes and totaled about $20 million in spending cuts. That’s just a small slice of the budget but again demonstrated the stark political divide over abortion rights in Michigan following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell: Drivers in Sartell can expect access changes on Minnesota Highway 15 at Stearns County Road 1 beginning Monday. County Road 1 will be reduced to a single lane through the Highway 15 intersection, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The northbound Highway 15 double left turn lane to westbound County Road 1 will also be reduced to one lane. The closures are to install a new access just west of Highway 15 along the north side of westbound County Road 1. Work will occur weekdays from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. through Aug. 4, weather permitting.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Military veteran Jeffrey Hulum III won a special election Tuesday in state House District 119 in Harrison County. He defeated Gary Fredericks, president of the Gulfport branch of the NAACP. Candidates run without party labels in Mississippi special elections, but Hulum and Fredericks previously ran for office as Democrats. Hulum will finish the four-year term that expires in January 2024. He succeeds Democrat Sonya Williams-Barnes of Gulfport, who resigned in May to become Mississippi policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. Williams-Barnes had served since January 2012. Republicans hold a majority in the 122-member House. The Legislature is next scheduled to meet when the regular session begins in January.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson and first lady Teresa Parson will travel to Germany and the Netherlands next week to promote Missouri businesses and trade. Missouri exported nearly $679 million in goods to Germany last year and more than $223 million to the Netherlands, according to the governor’s office. The trip will include stops in Frankfurt and Düsseldorf in Germany, as well as Amsterdam and The Hague in the Netherlands. The trip is funded by the Hawthorn Foundation, a Missouri nonprofit organization.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A man drove his pickup truck into a family as they walked in a tourist village bordering Glacier National Park and opened fire with a shotgun, killing one man and a toddler who was in her mother’s arms before the mother’s sister-in-law managed to kill the assailant after he ran out of ammunition, authorities said. Killed in the weekend attack on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northwestern Montana were David Siau, 39, of Syracuse, New York, and Siau’s 18-month-old daughter, McKenzie. Injured were Christy Siau, 40, and her sister-in-law, Christina Siau, 30. The assailant, Derick Amos Madden, 37, had been in a prior relationship with Christina Siau and had mental health issues, the Glacier County Sheriff’s Office said. Authorities on Wednesday would not say how he was killed. Two other children of David and Christy Siau were present but managed to run away and were not injured.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A 42-year-old Lincoln man died when someone walked onto his boat at Branched Oak Lake and shot him, prompting four other people to dive in to the water to escape, authorities said. Benjamin Case died in an apparently targeted shooting Tuesday night, Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said. The four other people on the boat were not injured, he said. Case and his friends were inside the boat’s cabin when the man walked onto the boat’s deck. Wagner said. Case opened the cabin door and was immediately shot twice with a handgun. The suspect – who did not fire toward the others – left the lake area in a vehicle, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Wagner said it did not appear the suspect took anything from the boat or the victim’s vehicle, which was parked at the lake.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:A woman accused of starting a July 7 wildfire in Truckee is a healing arts and yoga teacher who suffers from a mental health condition, according to her family. In a Facebook post on Ellen Lindsey Walters’ website, her father, Dave, said his daughter is “being treated with medication for a newly diagnosed mental condition.” “She wants people to understand that she would never have done this in her right mind, that the mental illness itself prevented her from knowing what she was doing …” he wrote. Ellen Lindsey Walters faces felony charges of arson and resisting an officer, and battery, a misdemeanor.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The National Weather Service confirmed Thursday a tornado touched down Monday in Chesterfield, the second one in New Hampshire this year. No injuries were reported. In May, a tornado touched down in Charlestown. Tornadoes are uncommon in the state. In 2009, a tornado destroyed the home of Brenda Stevens in Deerfield. She was killed in the collapse, but had protected her 3-month-old grandson, who survived.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Harvey Kesselman, a member of Stockton University’s inaugural graduating class who went on to serve as the school’s president for the past seven years, said he will be stepping down next year. Kesselman made the announcement during a Board of Trustees meeting Wednesday at the university’s Atlantic City campus. The fifth president in the school’s history, he plans to leave that post on June 30, 2023, but will remain at Stockton as president emeritus and a tenured professor of education. Kesselman was part of then-Stockton State College’s inaugural class in 1971 and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science, then received a master’s degree in student personnel services/counseling from Rowan University and a doctorate in higher education administration from Widener University.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: An earthquake occurring near the New Mexico-Texas border shook Carlsbad on Thursday morning as the region saw a recent uptick in seismic activity researchers tied to growing oil and gas operations. A magnitude 4.7 quake was reported at about 7:35 a.m., about 35 miles south of Whites City, per the U.S. Geological Survey. It was followed by a magnitude 3.0 reported at about 8:40 a.m. At 12:43 a.m. Thursday, a magnitude 3.1 earthquake was also recorded.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: An independent auditor will review the state government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including efforts by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration to downplay the number of deaths of nursing home residents. The state plans to select an independent auditor, who would have until late 2023 to deliver a final report, under a timeline released Tuesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office. Initial findings are expected in May. The report will include a planning guide for future emergencies and will explore issues from the transfer of nursing home patients to the reopening of schools and businesses to efforts to purchase needed medical supplies.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The family of a New York City firefighter killed last month when a tree fell onto the car he was driving at the Biltmore Estate has filed a lawsuit accusing the tourist attraction of gross negligence. Casey Skudin was driving near the Biltmore’s entrance June 17 with his wife and two children when the tree fell across the road, striking the car, officials said. A tree limb fell across the road amid high winds, an estate spokesperson has said. Casey Skudin died from his injuries and his wife, Angela and their two sons were also injured, including their 10-year-old son, who was knocked unconscious and sustained multiple fractures to his spine and sternum, the lawsuit filed on behalf of Skudin’s family stated. The suit claims the Biltmore “knowingly and intentionally kept a massive, rotted tree on its property next to a main road where Defendants knew it would cause great harm when it fell,” news outlets reported. It claimed Biltmore knew the tree posed a danger to guests and tried to keep it by installing steel cables. The complaint named The Biltmore Company, Biltmore Estate Wine Company, and Village Hotel on Biltmore Estate as defendants.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials said Wednesday a man from the eastern part of the state has contracted the state’s first assumed case of monkeypox, a disease that has emerged in more than 50 countries and 44 U.S. states. The person, who is now isolating, likely caught the virus while traveling outside the state, according to a release from the North Dakota Department of Health. The test sample will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. Health officials are working to find people who might be at risk because of close contact with the infected person.\n\nOhio\n\nWooster:Another round of storms battered some Ohio communities Wednesday night with heavy but brief rainfalls, 60 mph gusts and a confirmed tornado while producing picturesque bubble-like clouds at sunset. Straight-line winds coupled with an EF1 tornado felled trees and some power lines with winds ranging from 86 to 110 mph south of Shreve along the Wayne County and Holmes County border, the National Weather Service said in a preliminary report. Cooperative crews and those from AEP and FirstEnergy worked overnight and early Thursday morning to restore power. Rolling clouds filled the sky like an upside-down bubble bath colored burnt orange from the setting sun. The technical term for the clouds is mammatus, which is derived from Latin for udder or breast, according to Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Described as the “drooping underside ... of a cumulonimbus cloud,” according to weather.gov, pouches hung from the bottom of clouds providing an unusual sky that inspired some people to take pictures and share them on social media. These clouds can bring hail, rain and lightning, as was seen in Wayne and Holmes counties. A tornado warning had been issued for the area just before 9 p.m. and expired by 9:30 p.m.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: A suburban Oklahoma City motorcycle police officer was killed when he was struck from behind while on patrol, authorities said. Sgt. C.J. Nelson, 38, died Tuesday after being struck by a pickup truck just outside the Edmond city limits in Oklahoma City, according to Edmond police. Nelson would have marked his 13th anniversary with Edmond police on Wednesday and is the first Edmond officer to die in the line of duty, police said. Oklahoma City police, who are investigating the crash, said Nelson was stopped with other vehicles at a traffic light when they were struck by a truck driven by Jay Stephen Fite, 54. No other injuries were reported. Fite was arrested on a warrant for second-degree murder or first-degree manslaughter and was jailed without bond, according to jail records. Court records do not show that formal charges have been filed as of Thursday and jail records do not list an attorney who could speak on Fite’s behalf.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer caught on camera throwing a pepper spray can and shoving a woman in the face after a protest in northeast Portland has been found guilty of felony riot. A Multnomah County jury of nine women and three men returned the verdict against Mackenzie Lewis on Wednesday, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. On May 1, 2019, after a day of demonstrations, Lewis and the Patriot Prayer group approached anti-fascists who had gathered at the Cider Riot bar. Defense attorney Kelly Doyle argued Lewis’ actions were self-defense or to protect Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson. Lewis faces a maximum of five years in prison when sentenced Aug. 1. On Tuesday, Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge Benjamin Souede acquitted Gibson and associate Russell Schultz on felony riot charges in the same incident.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state has certified the results of primary elections from 64 of 67 counties, leaving out three in a growing legal dispute over whether to count mail-in ballots on which the voter didn’t handwrite a date, state officials said. Certification of the remaining three counties – Berks, Fayette and Lancaster – will occur once litigation is resolved, Gov. Tom Wolf’s Department of State said in a statement. The May 17 primary election included nominating contests for U.S. Senate, governor, Congress and most of the Legislature. The department sued the three counties last week seeking a court order requiring them to provide primary election results that include mail-in ballots on whose envelope the voter did not handwrite a date. In a court filing, Fayette County said the state didn’t have the authority to require it to count those ballots. Plus, the state’s lawsuit missed a deadline to appeal a county election board decision and courts have not yet settled separate lawsuits over whether to count the ballots, it said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Pete Seeger, the banjo-playing folk singer whose music was indelibly intertwined with his social activism, was honored Thursday as the latest American musician to appear on a U.S. postage stamp. The forever stamp, which features a color-tinted, black-and-white photograph taken in the early 1960s showing Seeger in profile singing and playing his five-string banjo, went on sale at post offices nationwide, according to a U.S. Postal Service spokesperson. A special ceremony was planned for the evening in Newport, the site of the Newport Folk Festival, where Seeger was a performer and for a time a member of the board. Seeger, a Harvard dropout who died in 2014 at age 94, wrote or co-wrote “If I Had a Hammer,” “Turn, Turn, Turn,” and “Where Have All the Flowers Gone.” He is also credited with popularizing “We Shall Overcome,” an anthem of the civil rights movement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalterboro: The once-powerful and now disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges he murdered his wife and son 13 months ago. Wearing a white face mask beneath his shaved head and ankle chains above shiny leather shoes, Murdaugh, 54, made his first court appearance in Colleton County since being indicted in the murder case last week. Despite his not guilty plea, he agreed to remain jailed without bond. One of his attorneys, Dick Harpootlian, said the defense team wanted to avoid a bond hearing that might reveal new information about the killings and risk prejudicing potential jurors when the case goes to trial. He also said Murdaugh, already saddled with $7 million in bond on unrelated criminal charges, can’t afford to put up cash for his release pending trial. Murdaugh has been behind bars since October, charged with financial crimes and several other misdeeds that were uncovered after the killings of his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate in June 2021. Murdaugh is charged with two counts of murder and two counts of possessing a weapon during a violent crime. The indictment alleged he fatally shot his wife with a rifle and used a shotgun to kill his son.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nOglala: A wildfire that started earlier this week west of Oglala has burned about 11 square miles and is 40% contained, according to officials. The fire began near Prairie Wind Casino on Tuesday night and moved southeast. Oglala Sioux President Kevin Killer said local groups from the tribe, such as the Emergency Management Department, focused on structural protection while the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Wildland Fire Management focused on putting out the fire. Two air tankers were dispatched to the area. State fire meteorologist Darren Clabo said weather conditions, including 40 mph winds, high temperatures and low humidity, most likely contributed to the fire, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reported. There’s no word on what might have ignited the fire. Six homes in the path of the fire were evacuated for a short time after the fire began. And, community shelters were temporarily opened for people displaced by the fire. No structural damage has been reported.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal magistrate has ordered an attorney suing a private prison firm over an inmate’s death to delete certain tweets – one of which describes the company as a “death factory” – and restrict his public commentary going forward. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffery Frensley issued the order last week in response to an argument from Tennessee-based CoreCivic that the public posts put the company’s right to a fair trial at risk. Attorney Daniel Horwitz, who is suing the company over the death of an inmate at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center, argued his posts amounted to constitutionally protected free speech. He said his clients and other inmates at CoreCivic facilities could benefit if public scrutiny leads to changes in their prisons. The judge agreed with the company. The judge wrote that Horwitz’s obligation is “to be an advocate, not an investigative journalist,” and said the attorney could be held in contempt of court if he continues to seek news media attention in the case.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Two men were indicted Wednesday in the case of a hot, airless tractor-trailer rig found last month with 53 dead or dying migrants in San Antonio, officials said. A federal grand jury indicted Homero Zamorano Jr., 46, and Christian Martinez, 28, both of Pasadena, Texas, on counts of transporting and conspiring to transport migrants illegally resulting in death; and transporting and conspiring to transport migrants illegally resulting in serious injury. Both remain in federal custody without bond pending trial. Martinez’s attorney, David Shearer of San Antonio declined to comment on the indictments. A message to Zamorano’s attorney was not immediately returned. Conviction on the death counts could result in life sentences, but the Attorney General’s office could authorize prosecutors to seek death penalties. The serious bodily injury counts carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison. It was the deadliest tragedy to claim the lives of migrants smuggled across the border from Mexico. The truck had been packed with 67 people, and the dead included 27 from Mexico, 14 from Honduras, seven from Guatemala and two from El Salvador, said Francisco Garduño, chief of Mexico’s National Immigration Institute.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:National Park Service firefighters from Zion National Park and surrounding crews responded to a wildfire on Kolob Terrace Road late Wednesday. Zion National Park indicated on social media that the fire was located about 15 driving miles north of state Route 9. The cause of the fire was still under investigation as of early Thursday. Officials estimated the blaze had burned at least 25 acres. Airplanes and helicopters were called in to assist with the fire. The only closures were Kolob Terrace Road at state Route 9 to the south and Lava Point to the north.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, 82, has undergone a second surgery to help repair a broken hip, his office said Wednesday. Leahy fell and broke his hip last month in his Virginia home. He underwent hip-replacement surgery June 30 at a Washington-area hospital. He was then moved to a rehabilitation center. On Wednesday, Leahy’s office said his surgeons found it necessary to perform an additional operation on the hip “to help advance his recovery.” Leahy was back in his rehabilitation room by Tuesday night. He is working with physical therapists “to return home as soon as possible.” Leahy’s office says the senator and his wife Marcelle “deeply appreciate the continued messages of support and affection that have been offered to them during his recovery.” Leahy, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, is not seeking reelection in November. When Leahy’s current term expires in January 2023, he will have served for 48 years in the Senate.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Richmond woman was sentenced Tuesday to more than five years in prison for directing a yearslong scheme to defraud state and federal officials of at least $230,000 in student financial aid funds, a prosecutor said. Court documents showed Kiesha Pope, 48, was the director of financial aid at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College starting in 2006. Pope was involved in a scheme to defraud the U.S. Department of Education, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the college of educational funds from 2011 to 2017, U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber said. News outlets reported Pope pleaded guilty earlier this year to wire fraud. Pope developed or increased financial aid eligibility for individuals, often her family members, who were not eligible for financial aid, Aber said. From there, Pope directed at least four co-conspirators to send her the majority of the funds, which she spent on personal expenses, including a vacation on Disney Cruise Line.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials with the National Park Service said Wednesday night the body of a climber who went missing Monday night at Olympic National Park has been found. Sean Allen, 38, of Port Angeles, was found by rescue workers using a helicopter to locate the man, whose body was on the southern end of Mount Mystery approaching the Del Monte ridgeline, park officials said in a written statement. His body has been transferred to the Jefferson County coroner, which will determine the cause and date of death, KOMO-TV reported. Allen obtained a wilderness permit for July 16-18 and was taking the route from Royal Basin to Home Lake alone. His itinerary included climbing attempts at Mount Mystery, Hall Foss Peak and Little Mystery. Allen was seen carrying a green Osprey backpack, ice ax and crampons and was using a green Nemo tent. He was likely wearing black, officials said. Allen was reported missing after he did not return from the backpacking excursion.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state continued working on resolving a computer systems outage Thursday that is affecting residents’ access to services at several state agencies, including the Division of Motor Vehicles. West Virginia Department of Administration officials announced Wednesday afternoon it was experiencing a mainframe outage caused by equipment failure at its data center. Officials said the state Office of Technology has ordered the parts needed to repair the hardware, but they don’t know how long the outage will last. Division of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Everett Frazier said Thursday the outage is affecting the Division of Motor Vehicles’ ability to provide many of its services, such as title work and driver record updates. But he said the agency’s offices are still open to the public. Frazier said customers can still use the agency’s online portal to renew car registration and driver’s licenses.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new report on Wisconsin employment showed the state is just about where it was before the coronavirus pandemic hit, but the recovery has been uneven. Total employment is down about 2.4%, or about 69,500 jobs from December 2019, according to the analysis from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. Employment in clothing stores decreased 20% statewide; gambling and recreation are down 15%; the food services industry declined 9%. The report showed one sector is thriving – transportation and warehousing, which grew 6.3% during the last two years. The unemployment rate has hovered around 3% the last several months and businesses are still struggling to find workers for their vacant positions.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new poll by the Casper Star-Tribune showed nearly 60% of Wyoming Republicans who plan to vote in next month’s primary said U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney’s service on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot makes them less likely to vote for her.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/17/carbon-storage-commissioner-comeback-hand-recounts-news-around-states/50609615/", "title": "Carbon storage, commissioner comeback, hand recounts: News ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A project that’s been planned for more than a decade is nearing fruition, thanks to a $20 million federal grant. The Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor has been on hold for years because of a lack of funding, city officials said. Known unofficially as the skybridge, the PARC project will safely connect the downtown, Mill Creek and Lower Mill communities through greenways and a suspended pedestrian bridge, al.com reports. Those three areas are now separated by two major state and federal roads. The funding comes from the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. “We appreciate our partnership with the federal government and this grant, which will help us take Huntsville to the next level,” Mayor Tommy Battle said. Two other Alabama projects also received funding through similar grants. The town of Cordova received $5.2 million to improve deteriorating roadways, and the Northwest Alabama Council of Local Governments received $2 million for the Shoals Area Railroad Overpass in Colbert County. Shane Davis, Huntsville’s director of Urban & Economic Development, said the city’s skybridge project has been a goal since 2006.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Baby boomers who retired early as the COVID-19 pandemic set in are a key factor behind the state’s labor shortage, Alaska Public Media reports. State economist Dan Robinson told the news outlet that many older workers felt they could afford to take the leap early, while many others who left the labor market in recent years were in their 30s and stymied by a lack of child care. He told APM that while the pandemic was a factor, employers will just have to adjust to a new reality, as a lack of stable funding for government services means Alaska’s population loss trend is unlikely to abate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Proponents of three voter initiatives who each turned in hundreds of thousands of signatures last month to qualify them for the November ballot are trying to beat back legal challenges that could prevent them from going before voters. Two of the measures – one requiring disclosure of who is funding political campaigns and another rolling back or blocking efforts by Republicans to tighten voting rules – are being challenged by pro-business groups. They alleged that paid petition circulators made errors or omitted required information on their registrations with the secretary of state or petitions. The third measure, backed by a California-based employee union, would protect residents from predatory bill collection and raise the amount of assets shielded from bill collectors. It faces a similar challenge from a newly formed group funded by Arizona debt collection agencies, who say the description voters saw when they asked to sign was illegally misleading. Lawyers for challengers and the initiative proponents have spent the past two weeks in court, and three different Phoenix judges will decide who is correct. Whichever sides lose are are expected to appeal directly to the state Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the state’s use of the sedative midazolam in its lethal injections. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court judge’s ruling upholding Arkansas’ execution process. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker ruled in 2020 that the state’s use of midazolam in injections is constitutional and dismissed claims that less painful methods of execution are available. “With no scientific consensus and a paucity of reliable scientific evidence concerning the effect of large doses of midazolam on humans, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the prisoners failed to demonstrate that the Arkansas execution protocol is sure or very likely to cause severe pain,” the appeals panel said in its ruling. The ruling comes more than five years since Arkansas raced to execute eight inmates over 11 days before its batch of midazolam expired. The state ultimately put four men to death after courts halted the other four executions. It hasn’t executed any inmates since 2017 and has none scheduled. “It is past time that justice be carried out in these cases of defendants killing innocent people, and the Eighth Circuit’s decision reaffirms that Arkansas’ execution protocol is constitutional,” Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente psychologists, therapists, social workers and other mental health workers in Northern California began an open-ended strike Monday over staffing shortages that their union said have led patients to wait for months to get help. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents the workers, is negotiating a new contract with the Oakland-based health giant. It said the strike is to demand Kaiser hire more mental health workers to ease the burden put on the current staff. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement it has hired hundreds of new mental health workers, including 200 since January 2021, and pointed out the shortage in mental health care professionals is happening nationwide. It said that what’s at issue is the union’s demand to increase the time therapists spend on tasks other than seeing patients. The union is demanding 9 hours be allotted for administrative work, which would leave only 31 hours to see patients per week, the company said. It said it proposed increasing the time for administrative tasks from 6 to 7.2 hours, leaving 32.8 hours to see patients. Jeffrey Chen-Harding, a clinical social worker with Kaiser who was picketing Monday in San Francisco, said that what Kaiser calls an administrative task is actually important work directly related to patient care.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man had a rude awaking early Saturday morning when a roughly 400-pound bear flipped the lever doorknob to his home and rummaged through some dog food, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said Monday. The homeowner, Ken Mauldin, grabbed a gun and shot the bear multiple times until it collapsed and died just after 2 a.m., said Rachael Gonzalez, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Nobody was injured, she said. Officers removed the animal from the house, located in the ski resort town of Steamboat Springs. The couple had a legal right to shoot the bear if they felt threatened, Gonzalez said. Colorado has roughly 12,000 bears, and break-ins aren’t uncommon in Rocky Mountain towns. People shooting and killing bears in self-defense, however, is rare, Gonzalez said. This particular male bear was not tagged, and the department does not know if it was involved in other break-ins, she said. “Steamboat, that area, they’ve been dealing with bears getting into homes all summer long,” Gonzalez said. “It’s not impossible that this bear learned the behavior from another bear.” Residents of Steamboat Springs are warned by the agency to lock doors and windows, secure their trash and recycling in bear-proof bins, and even take down bird feeders to prevent these kind of confrontations.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday cleared the way for a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut to proceed against Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The case was filed by relatives of some victims of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Jones has falsely claimed that the nation’s deadliest school shooting – which killed 20 students and six educators – was a hoax. Jones’ lawyer had sought to transfer the case to a federal bankruptcy court, rather than continue the case in Connecticut state court. That move brought the first day of jury selection to a sudden halt earlier this month. However, Monday’s ruling by Judge Julie Manning essentially allows the plaintiffs to continue the defamation lawsuit against just Jones as an individual, without Free Speech Systems, a company owned by Jones and a defendant in the Connecticut case. “The plaintiffs’ rights to have that process continue in the Connecticut Superior Court should not be disturbed,” Manning wrote in the decision, adding that the plaintiffs’ claims for damages were ready for trial. A Texas jury this month ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook and another $4.1 million for the suffering he put them through by claiming for years that the shooting was a hoax.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A family is hoping for change after a 37-year-old man with an intellectual disability had his arm broken while he was taken into police custody earlier this year in an encounter advocates say could have gone differently if crisis intervention tactics were used. The man, who was violating a court order when he stood across the street from his aunt’s house in the New Castle area and is now facing charges, called police himself to report an argument with his aunt. The encounter ended with him being leg-swiped by an officer, which landed him on the ground with a broken arm that required surgery. New Castle County Police investigated the use of force officers exhibited that night and found that officer conduct was appropriate. But the encounter is one from which family and advocates say police can and should learn, as people with disabilities are more likely to be victims of police brutality. “Disability-related behaviors can be misunderstood by law enforcement officers who are trained to gain control and compliance on a scene but typically not trained to identify a disability or know how to interact or communicate with persons with disabilities,” said Carlean Ponder, director of disability rights and housing policy at The Arc, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Homeland Security Department’s inspector general has refused congressional requests for documents and staff testimony about the erasure of Secret Service communication related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, angering top Democrats who accuse him of unlawfully obstructing their investigation. In an Aug. 8 letter disclosed Tuesday, Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the leaders of the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees that his office will not comply with their requests for internal documents and sit-down interviews due to the ongoing criminal investigation into deleted Secret Service text messages. In response, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter Tuesday demanding Cuffari turn over documents and make his staff available to lawmakers or risk facing a potential congressional subpoena “Your obstruction of the Committees’ investigations is unacceptable, and your justifications for this noncompliance appear to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Congress’s authority and your duties as an Inspector General,” Maloney and Thompson wrote in the letter. “If you continue to refuse to comply with our requests, we will have no choice but to consider alternate measures to ensure your compliance,” they wrote.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Tracks used by the nation’s deadliest railroad will see added fencing to keep pedestrians away and safety improvements at crossings under a $25 million federal grant announced Monday. Brightline and government officials announced the grant as the privately owned passenger line continues to be plagued by deaths along its tracks between Miami and West Palm Beach. In the past two weeks, Brightline trains have killed three people – and 68 since the service began its first runs five years ago. That’s about one death for every 33,000 miles its trains travel, the worst fatality rate among the nation’s more than 800 railroads, according to an ongoing Associated Press analysis of Federal Railroad Administration data. The grant, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program, will cover safety features, including 33 miles of fencing at locations of frequent trespassing along with extensive crossing improvements at all 333 crossings along the corridor, which will eventually stretch from Miami to Orlando, Brightline President Patrick Goddard said. The company will also install an additional 150 warning signs and 170 more suicide crisis hotline signs “to better reach those who might be struggling with suicide,” Goddard said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he will spend up to $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 aid on payments of $350 apiece to more than 3 million Georgians who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps or cash welfare assistance. The payments will start in September, said Katie Byrd, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move comes atop Kemp’s proposals last week to spend $2 billion in state surplus, split between property tax rebates and a second round of income tax rebates, if voters choose him for a second term in November over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Those separate plans would require legislative approval next year. Monday’s announcement will put money in the hands of less affluent Georgians in the months before the nationally watched election in a narrowly contested swing state. Those are voters to whom Abrams has been tailoring her economic platform. She also backs another round of income tax rebates, like those Kemp already pushed though, but has been arguing that Georgia also needs to do more to invest in long-term expansions of health, education and small-business assistance to try to create a less unequal economy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new monk seal on Oahu’s North Shore has marine officials asking the public to give the mother and pup plenty of room, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The baby monk seal is the 14th birthed by mother Right Spot and her first on Oahu, having typically given birth on the island of Molokai, where she was born.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge says the Legislature can intervene in the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit targeting the state’s total abortion ban – but only to present evidence about emergency abortions performed in Medicaid-funded emergency rooms. In the written ruling handed down Saturday, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the Legislature’s interests are already well-represented by the Idaho Attorney General’s office and Gov. Brad Little, so there’s no legitimate reason to add another party to the lawsuit. The Justice Department sued Idaho last week over the state’s strict abortion ban, saying it would force doctors to violate the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law that requires anyone coming to a medical facility for emergency treatment to be stabilized and treated. Allowing a state legislature the right to intervene in every federal case without first proving a distinct need would allow a state to “turn into a nine-headed Hydra whenever it chooses,” Winmill said. The abortion ban was enacted in 2020 and set up as a “trigger law,” set to take effect Aug. 25 now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions, and anyone who performs, attempts or assists with abortions can face two to five years in prison and lose their health care license. Physicians who perform abortions to save a patient’s life or in cases of rape or incest can use that information as a legal defense during the criminal trial.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A suburban Chicago police officer who fatally shot a hatchet-wielding man during a June traffic stop was justified in the deadly shooting, a prosecutor has determined. DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said Monday that Naperville police Officer Frank Tonkovich “reasonably believed” Edward Samaan, 28, of Naperville, was trying to kill either him or a driver Tonkovich had pulled over separately. Berlin said in a news release that Tonkovich’s actions were not just reasonable “but necessary in order to prevent great bodily harm or death to himself or the motorist he had stopped,” The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reports. The officer had pulled over a car June 3 and was standing at that driver’s window when Samaan pulled his vehicle up nearby, exited it and charged Tonkovich with a hatchet in his hand, Berlin said. Tonkovich then shot at Samaan six times, hitting him five times. Samaan was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officer, a 22-year-veteran of the Naperville Police Department, was not injured.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Preliminary autopsy results released Monday for the three victims of a house explosion in a southern Indiana neighborhood show they died of blunt force trauma and compression asphyxia. A married couple who lived at the center of the Wednesday explosion in Evansville, 43-year-old Charles Hite and 37-year-old Martina Hite, both died of blunt force trauma to their chests, and 29-year-old neighbor Jessica Teague died of compression asphyxia, the Vanderburgh County Coroner’s Office said in a news release. Final autopsy reports and toxicology are pending, Chief Deputy Coroner David Anson said in the news release. The explosion injured a fourth person and damaged 39 homes, leaving 11 uninhabitable, authorities have said. A statement Monday by the Evansville Fire Department said the investigation is still in its early stages and likely will be lengthy. Suzanne Dabkowski, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said last week that the agency can’t speak to any possible causes of the explosion. Dabkowski said the ATF has explosive specialists and firearms investigators on site helping with the investigation. Evansville authorities have declined to speculate whether natural gas or another issue is responsible for the explosion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The developer of a proposed $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline must release the names of landowners who could be affected along its roughly 680-mile route, a district judge ruled. Summit Carbon Solutions, an Ames company that has proposed building a pipeline to transport liquefied carbon dioxide, failed to win a permanent injunction to keep secret the names of thousands of landowners it said could be in the pipeline’s path. Under state law, Summit was required to hold public meetings for landowners potentially affected by the pipeline project, and the company compiled a list with more than 10,000 names along the route. After the Iowa Utilities Board asked Summit to submit the names, the company asked state regulators to keep the list confidential. Summit also filed a petition with the court to keep the names secret. The Sierra Club of Iowa asked regulators to release the names under state’s open records law, a move state Consumer Advocate Jennifer Easler also supported. In November, the Iowa Utilities Board decided it would keep secret most of the names, saying property owners’ right to privacy outweighed the public’s interest. On Friday, Polk County District Judge David Nelmark said Summit had failed to show landowner information should be excluded from state public records law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to do a partial hand recount that won’t change the outcome of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights after abortion opponents charged almost $120,000 to credit cards Monday to cover the cost. The Kansas secretary of state’s office said the recount will occur in nine of the state’s 105 counties that account for more than half of the votes cast on the Aug. 2 abortion ballot question, including four of the state’s five most populous counties. Voters who want to keep the abortion rights allowed under the Kansas Constitution prevailed in eight of the nine counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby in far western Kansas, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita who also promotes election conspiracies, pledged to help pay for the recount. Gietzen used a credit card to pay for all but $1,500 of the costs, which Leavitt will cover. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Leavitt has an online fundraising effort that had received more than $41,000 in donations as of Monday evening.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Experts who are visiting disaster centers can help people whose heirlooms and keepsakes were damaged in recent flooding. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force experts may be able to help save photos, artwork, quilts, important documents and other items, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The experts are visiting Clay County Community Center this week Friday through Sunday, Knott County Sportsplex Tuesday through Sunday, and Hazard Community College First Federal Center Wednesday through Sunday. FEMA said the experts will discuss how to handle, dry and clean the items, and they can provide information about personal safety during the restoration process. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force is co-sponsored by FEMA and the Smithsonian Institution. The task force was created to protect cultural heritage from damage from natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Law enforcement officers have ended a three-day peaceful protest by jail inmates who demanded improvements to living conditions, including quicker attention to requests for medical care. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson issued a statement saying her deputies and state Department of Public Safety and Corrections officers entered a pod inside the Orleans Justice Center on Sunday night after inmates activated the sprinkler system and began to flood the area, WDSU-TV reports. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported inmates had barricaded a pod and refused food, water and medication. Hutson said deputies repeatedly offered to bring food and medication, and inmates refused to accept it. Inmates produced a list of desired changes that Hutson released Sunday. It included demands for more recreation time, a new washer and dryer, a second television, and the lifting of restrictions on how many books and photos inmates may receive each month. They also demanded proper medication and said they wanted sick calls to be treated seriously. An altercation at the jail in June resulted in the death of an inmate, and three stabbings recently occurred in the pod where the protest happened.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators who want to enforce new vessel speed rules to help protect rare whales can expect some pushback from ship operators. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the new proposed rules, which are designed to protect the last remaining North Atlantic right whales, last month. The rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast and require more vessels to comply with the rules. The agency’s National Marine Fisheries Service is holding a series of informational meetings on the new rules. Some shipping and maritime groups said they have concerns the rules could make their jobs more difficult or less safe. The American Pilots’ Association is concerned the new rules would make operations more hazardous for pilot boats, said Clayton Diamond, executive director of the group. Pilot boats transport maritime pilots to and from larger ships, often in bad weather and at carefully calculated speeds, Diamond said. “We think that the NOAA/NMFS proposal to apply the speed restriction to pilot boats is unwise and unsafe,” Diamond said, adding that the group “strongly” supports protecting marine mammals. The agency isn’t commenting on industry concerns during the rulemaking process, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Maryland State Board of Elections voted Monday to file an emergency petition in court that seeks an earlier count of mail-in ballots for the general election in November. The board voted 4-0 to seek a legal remedy in hopes of speeding up the vote count for mail-in ballots, which have become much more popular with voters in the state. In a statement after the vote, the board said that the continued expansion of mail-in balloting and the inability of the local boards of elections to count mail-in ballots before Election Day could have significant implications. “It could leave local, statewide, and even federal contests without certified results until late December 2022 or early January 2023,” the board said. “Maryland is currently the only state in the union that forbids any kind of processing of mail-in ballots until after Election Day.” Currently, mail-in ballots can’t be counted until two days after Election Day. That caused delays in determining winners in the state’s primary last month. The state elections board certified the primary election Monday. Maryland’s primary was delayed by three weeks due to legal challenges involving congressional and legislative redistricting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michael Cox, a Boston police veteran who was brutally beaten by fellow officers while chasing a suspect and fought against efforts to cover up his assault, was sworn in Monday as commissioner of the police department. After taking the oath during a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, Cox thanked his family and friends who supported him through the incident that he said changed his life forever but does not define him. “I’ve worked to change policing since that incident occurred, and I will continue to do all I can to make sure that no Black or brown person or any individual, no matter their gender identity or race, is the victim of any kind of unconstitutional policing,” said Cox, who is Black. Mayor Michelle Wu called Cox a leader that Boston “deserves.” “I’m incredibly proud, grateful and inspired in the future for this city with Commissioner Michael Cox at the helm of the Boston Police Department,” she said. The Boston native most recently served as police chief in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Before taking that job in 2019, Cox served three decades in the Boston Police Department, where he took on the so-called blue wall of silence after he was attacked by colleagues who mistook him for a fleeing suspect whom he was trying to grab as he scaled a fence.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint Township: A name change for Flint Township will not appear on the fall ballot. Township trustees voted 4-2 Monday against placing the question on the ballot. The result would not have been binding, but there had been interest in getting the public’s opinion about a change to Oak Hills Township, MLive.com reports. Supporters of a name change say “Flint” carries baggage. The city is nearby. “In my business world, I have a really hard time selling Flint Township to outside folks,” said Winfield Cooper, a real estate broker. “I have to explain to them it’s not the city of Flint. I have to explain to them it’s not lead-contaminated water.” Flint’s water was contaminated in 2014-15 because state regulators didn’t require that water from the Flint River be treated to reduce corrosion. Changing the township name would cost at least $72,000 to change uniforms, vehicles and buildings at the fire and police departments. “It does nothing to change the township other than to spend money,” said resident Roger Powell, who opposed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Corrections has dropped its order that 18 prisoners who were released from prison to protect their health during the coronavirus pandemic report back to prison. The state had ordered the 18 to return to prison by Monday. But a Ramsey County judge has granted a temporary restraining order, saying reincarcerating the individuals could still be detrimental to their health. Assistant Attorney General Corinne Wright on Friday asked Judge Mark Ireland to cancel further hearings on the corrections order and said the state instead will make individual determinations for the 18 people remaining on conditional medical release, according to an email shared by American Civil Liberties Union Minnesota attorney Daniel Shulman, who sued on behalf of the inmates. “I applaud them for taking this step, and I hope that they will let these people remain on (medical release) where they should be,” Shulman told the Star Tribune. The 18 former prisoners were among the 158 people granted conditional medical release as COVID-19 swept through the prison population in Minnesota. Nearly 2,300 prisoners had applied for release.\n\nMississippi\n\nFlowood: For the second time in less than a month, an innocent bystander was killed during a police chase involving the same department. One person was killed Sunday during a police chase that began in Pearl. The chase ended when the vehicle that was being pursued crashed into a motorcycle, killing the driver. Public information officer Greg Flynn said a Pearl police officer attempted to make a traffic stop when a silver sedan took off. The officer pursued the vehicle into the neighboring city of Flowood, where police there joined the chase until it ended after the fleeing vehicle struck a motorcycle. Flynn said police later discovered the man was driving with a suspended license and had felony convictions at the federal and state levels. He is being charged with felony fleeing resulting in death. Pearl police, Flowood police, the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office and the Flowood Fire Department responded to the scene. Three weeks ago, another vehicle being pursued by Pearl police crashed into a U.S. Postal Service truck in Jackson, killing mail carrier Brad Pennington, 32. That chase began when police attempted to pull over a man for speeding. The man allegedly failed to pull over, and police chased him into Jackson until he crashed his Toyota Camry into Pennington’s mail truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nWyatt: A gas explosion Monday at a southeast Missouri home killed one person and injured nine others, authorities said. The explosion happened about 7 a.m. in Wyatt, a town of about 280 people that’s about 130 miles south of St. Louis, said Capt. Barry Morgan with the Mississippi County Sheriff’s Office. He said authorities were trying to determine whether a water heater or stove was to blame. He identified the person killed only as a man in his mid-20s. Nine other people – the youngest just 6 months old – had serious or critical burn injuries. Several were flown to hospitals in St. Louis and Memphis, Tennessee. “That is a ton of people in a house,” Morgan said. “So that’s what we’re trying to determine, why there were so many people in there, because when I arrived on scene, it was just there was victims lying everywhere, badly burned.” The garage of a neighboring home also caught fire, but no one inside that structure was hurt, Morgan said. The State Fire Marshal and a state propane commission were investigating.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans who must travel long distances to election offices and cope with unreliable and infrequent mail delivery are further disenfranchised under election laws approved last year, a lawyer said Monday during opening statements in a trial challenging the laws’ constitutionality. Jacqueline De León, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, said she would present evidence that the laws ending Election Day voter registration in Montana and banning the paid collection of voted ballots put unreasonable barriers on Native Americans who already face other economic and logistical obstacles. The new laws were passed by the Legislature in 2021, and a similar ballot collection law was declared unconstitutional by two state judges in 2020. “We should not have to bring this case again. But we will certainly prove, once again, that Native Americans are disproportionately and unfairly impacted” by the two bills, De León said. The trial that began Monday in Billings also challenges a law that requires additional proof of residency besides student IDs for college students to register and vote. The trial before District Court Judge Michael Moses is scheduled to last 10 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state audit says the former head of the nonprofit History Nebraska organization diverted COVID-19 relief money to a private foundation, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek’s report suggested potential criminal liability for former History Nebraska Executive Director Trevor Jones over the 2020 transfer of two pandemic aid checks representing more than $270,000 to the History Nebraska Foundation, a then-new group that rivaled History Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As officials in some rural parts of the state vow to bypass voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots this November, the Nevada secretary of state’s office is proposing statewide rules that would specify how to do it, including requiring bipartisan vote counters, creating room for observation and instructing how many ballots to count at a time. On Friday, four voting rights groups came out against the proposal, calling it an “admirable attempt to ensure higher standards” for counting votes by hand but urging the secretary of state to prohibit the practice outright, noting that the push for hand-counting stems from “unfounded speculation” about voting machines. “The regulations are not enough to address the underlying accuracy issues and remediate the legal deficiencies of hand count processes,” the groups Brennan Center, All Voting is Local, ACLU Nevada and Silver State Voices said in a statement Friday. Both voting rights groups and hand-counting proponents spoke at an online hearing Friday, the first meeting convened to discuss the regulations. Voting rights groups lobbied to prohibit hand counts, while voting machine skeptics, a majority of the speakers, said the proposed regulations were a power grab meant to sabotage hand-counting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: As COAST enters its 40th year, the regional bus transportation service is preparing to build a new operations, maintenance and administrative facility, funded in large part by $7.7 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas were among those legislators instrumental in getting the $7.7 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to improve public transportation in the area. “COAST has provided reliable public transportation throughout the Seacoast region for more than 40 years,” Shaheen said. “Its current Dover facility is too small and outdated to achieve its full potential, which is why I helped secure this $7.7 million grant to construct a new facility. This improved facility will advance the quality and sustainability of public transit in the region, which will help drive local economic growth.” Hassan said the grant will “ensure that Granite Staters can get where they need to go safely and efficiently,” while Pappas noted “this grant will help COAST achieve its mission of providing affordable and accessible public transportation.” COAST said the federal funding will greatly enhance its ability to meet the Seacoast’s public transportation needs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With three state Supreme Court seats vacant, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner announced that a trio of appellate court judges would be temporarily promoted to fill the gaps. The order, issued Monday, comes amid a “crisis” of judicial vacancies statewide, causing massive backlogs for cases such as divorces and estate settlements. That shortage includes the New Jersey Supreme Court, which hasn’t had as many vacancies as it does now in recent memory – an “outrageous” scenario, one lawyer said. “Assigning one appellate judge is not uncommon, but three may be unprecedented,” said Carl Golden, who was director of communications for the judiciary from 1990 to 1993 under then-Chief Justice Robert Wilentz. Rabner’s order named Judges Clarkson Fisher Jr., Jack Sabatino and Douglas Fasciale to the state’s highest court. These judges, “who are senior in service,” Rabner said, will “participate in new matters presented for the court’s consideration.” Jeralyn Lawrence, president of the state’s bar association, said these jurists are the “best of the best,” but this is “not what the constitution envisioned, and the triage continues.” “All three levels of our courts are being impacted solely because our governor and our Legislature can’t fill these vacancies, and they are hurting the public,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Cowboys for Trump founder Couy Griffin is fighting to keep his seat as a county commissioner as he faces possible removal and disqualification from public office for his participation in last year’s insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Griffin was previously convicted of a misdemeanor for entering Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Three residents of Santa Fe and Los Alamos counties filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Griffin from being commissioner of Otero County’s 2nd district for the rest of his term. Griffin, a 47-year-old Republican, is representing himself in the two-day bench trial that began Monday. “This lawsuit is about removing a duly elected county commissioner from office through the civil court,” Griffin said in court. “By allowing this case to move forward, you’re going to set a very dangerous precedent.” On the witness stand Monday, Griffin said he went to Washington, D.C., to peacefully protest and pray with other Trump supporters. “I had no intention of breaking the law on that day,” he said. The three plaintiffs in the case argued in a 259-page petition that Griffin should be disqualified from holding public office on the basis of a clause in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is endorsing Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler in his contentious primary contest with another veteran U.S. House member from the state, Carolyn Maloney. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that “New York has a lot of outstanding leaders but few of them lead with the courage, conviction, and brilliant legislative effectiveness” that Nadler has. He called Nadler a “critical partner” who “was right on the issues years before so many others.” Nadler, 75, and Maloney, 76, have each represented Manhattan-area districts in Congress for 30 years but have gone from allies to rivals after their Upper West Side and Upper East Side districts were drawn together under new redistricting maps. Schumer’s backing comes on the heels of Nadler winning an endorsement from The New York Times over the weekend ahead of the Aug. 23 primary. The newspaper’s endorsement carries a lot of weight in deep-blue New York City but is expected to be especially decisive in a contest featuring two veteran lawmakers. Nadler and Maloney chair the powerful House Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectively. Another Democrat, 38-year-old attorney Suraj Patel, is also running in the primary race for New York’s 12th District.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: After receiving more than a dozen reports of conduct violations by party-appointed poll watchers during the May primaries, the state elections board tightened regulations for precinct observers Tuesday to prevent partisan interference in the November general election. The board unanimously voted to approve temporary rules for the upcoming election that more clearly outline the code of conduct for partisan observers, prohibiting them from standing close to a “tabulator, laptop, pollbook or other voting document” where they could view marked ballots or confidential voter information. The revisions heighten scrutiny for observers and poll workers alike, adding to a list of prohibited conduct for precinct officials that forbids them from tampering with voting equipment or expressing their political views on the job. While poll watching has been an element of electoral transparency since the 1800s, the practice grew in prominence in the 2020 election cycle due to ex-President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. A survey of county elections directors in late May found violations in 15 North Carolina counties, where officials observed poll watchers harassing voters and attempting to enter restricted areas to view confidential voting records.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Monday that he’ll work with legislators on a bill next session to “guarantee that the opportunity exists” for students and elected governing bodies to say the Pledge of Allegiance, if they choose. The Republican governor’s announcement comes after the Fargo School Board last week announced plans to stop reciting the pledge on the grounds that it doesn’t align with the district’s diversity code. Under current state law, governing bodies and schools can’t be required to recite the pledge. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor’s aim is to ensure that those who wish to say it may legally do so. “America is the land of opportunity. And students in every public school in North Dakota, along with elected governing bodies and those who attend their meetings, should have the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and express support for the American ideals upon which our country was founded,” Burgum said in a statement. “Our administration is creating a framework for legislation to guarantee that the opportunity exists to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, as other states have done,” the statement said. Burgum said he is working with state Sen. Scott Meyer of Grand Forks and state Reps. Pat Heinert of Bismarck and Todd Porter of Mandan to draft the legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio mothers who rely on Medicaid will now be eligible for up to a year of health coverage after the birth of a child, up from 60 days previously. Up to 21,000 low-income and disabled people annually will benefit from this change, said the Ohio Department of Medicaid, which announced the change before April but only received final approval from the federal government Tuesday. “We know that access to postpartum care not only saves lives but leads to better health outcomes for moms and their babies,” Maureen Corcoran, director of Ohio Medicaid, said in a statement. “Extending eligibility for a full year postpartum ensures women have access to critical services that impact maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the health of their baby.” Available coverage includes treatment for postpartum depression; medical care for chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes; breastfeeding resources; and nurse home visits. The change was initiated by state lawmakers in the previous state budget. Ohio suffers from one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation, at 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. The extended coverage, for now, will be available for a five-year period through April 2027.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt granted death row inmate Richard Glossip a 60-day stay of execution Tuesday while a state appeals court considers his claim of innocence. Stitt signed an executive order delaying Glossip’s execution for the 1997 killing of Glossip’s boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, that was scheduled for Sept. 22. “This stay is granted to allow time for the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to address a pending legal proceeding,” the order said. A Stitt spokeswoman declined to comment on the governor’s decision, which also means that a clemency hearing before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that was scheduled for next week will be delayed. Glossip asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for a new evidentiary hearing following the release of an independent investigation by Houston law firm Reed Smith that raised new questions about his guilt. The firm’s report did not find any definitive proof of Glossip’s innocence but raised concerns about lost or destroyed evidence and a detective asking leading questions to Glossip’s co-defendant, Justin Sneed, to implicate Glossip in the slaying. Sneed admitted killing Van Treese but said he did so at Glossip’s direction. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison and was a key witness against Glossip.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s chief justice fired all the members of the Public Defense Services Commission on Monday, frustrated that hundreds of defendants charged with crimes and who cannot afford an attorney have been unable to obtain public defenders to represent them. The unprecedented action comes as Oregon’s unique public defender system has come under such strain that it is at the breaking point. Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation due to a shortage of public defenders filed a lawsuit in May that alleges the state is violating their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. In a letter to the commission members, Chief Justice Martha Walters said that “it is now clear that it is time to reconstitute the current commission.” Oregon’s public defender system is the only one in the nation that relies entirely on contractors: Large nonprofit defense firms, smaller cooperating groups of private defense attorneys that contract for cases and independent attorneys who can take cases at will. But some firms and private attorneys are periodically refusing to take new cases because of the workload. Poor pay rates and late payments from the state are also a disincentive. The American Bar Association found that Oregon has only 31% of the public defenders it needs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBerwick: Two people remained in critical condition Tuesday after a car drove through a crowd at a weekend fundraiser for victims of a house fire, killing one woman and injuring 17 other people, authorities said. Of the 17 injured, two remained in critical condition in Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, while five others were listed as fair, a hospital spokesperson said. Ten other people had been released following treatment at several hospitals, state police said. Adrian Oswaldo Sura Reyes, 24, is charged with homicide in the death of 50-year-old Rebecca Reese, of Wilkes-Barre, at the fundraiser in Berwick shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He faces another homicide count in the slaying of his mother at their Nescopeck home minutes later. Police allege in a criminal complaint that Sura Reyes told investigators he was driving in Berwick after arguing with his mother. At the time, about 75 people were in a blocked-off parking lot outside the Intoxicology Department bar for a fundraiser to benefit victims of the Aug. 5 blaze in Nescopeck that killed seven adults and three children. Police say Sura Reyes told them he drove past, then turned and headed back “to drive through the crowd of people.” They allege that video corroborates his alleged statement to investigators that he “sped up into the crowd purposefully.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A carousel that’s the last vestige of an amusement park next to the Providence River is spinning again after getting a new foundation. The Crescent Park carousel started running again Aug. 6 and will continue to operate Saturdays and Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. until Oct. 10, as well as on three Fridays: Aug. 26, Sept. 23 and Oct. 21. Rides cost $2. Having sat closed since the start of the pandemic, as cleaning procedures would have damaged the antique horses, dragons and a camel, crews used the time to stabilize and then replace the carousel’s foundation. This month, as it cranked up again after the hiatus, the carousel gave 958 rides. Carousel Manager Tracy Johnson is training new staff members on how to operate the attraction. Caretaker Ed Serowik said he started working at what was then the Crescent Amusement Park as a child in 1948, setting up pins at the bowling alley before working the carousel in 1950. He is now one of the primary people conducting maintenance on the ride. “It’s exactly the same,” he said, looking up at the mirrors that ring the carousel.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A small group of state lawmakers have given their approval to a near-total abortion ban that does not include exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The 3-1 vote Tuesday – all Republicans on a House subcomittee for it and the lone Democrat against – set up a showdown later in the day on whether to send the restrictive bill to the House floor. South Carolina currently has a six-week ban passed in 2021 that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Republican lawmakers plan a special sessions over the next month to consider even more restrictions. The bill bans all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. It lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into the exceptions. The legislation still has a long way to go before it could reach Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who has said he wants to see no abortions in the state. Opponents and supporters alike said the proposal could change considerably on its way through the General Assembly. Outside the House’s office building on Statehouse grounds, about a dozen demonstrators with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic gathered. They were outnumbered by law enforcement, who set fencing and barricades expected to stay up most of the week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Final vehicle counts for vehicles entering Sturgis indicate traffic was up 2% from the past five years during the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation. A total of 502,835 vehicles entered Sturgis over 10 days, according to SDDOT. The previous five-year average was 492,535 vehicles. The first day of the rally on Aug. 5 had 11% more traffic than the past five years, according to SDDOT.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Predators Foundation is teaming up on an event offering people gift cards, preseason vouchers and giveaways if they turn in guns to the city’s police. The NHL team says its foundation is partnering on the event Saturday at Greater Revelations Missionary Baptist Church. People can turn in guns to the Metro Nashville Police Department there with no questions asked. They can also drop off unused or expired medication that police will destroy. In seven Gift Card for Guns days since 2011, people turned in 658 firearms. It’s the first year the Preds Foundation has been involved in the event. Predators Vice President of Community Relations Rebecca King expressed hope that the initiative would make the community safer.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As they consider pay raises for other city employees, the Austin City Council’s members this week are poised to give themselves a 40% pay raise – one some members defend as long overdue and more reflective of the hours they work. The topic will come up Wednesday as the council works on setting the city’s operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The money for the pay increase would come from the additional $20 million the city recently discovered for the council to spend in any way it sees fit. Several council members say there is enough money available not only to boost their pay but also to identify an estimated $5 million to $10 million needed to raise the minimum hourly wage for city employees to $20. In total, the council pay raises would cost the city’s taxpayers an additional $371,000 per year. “The dollar amount we’re talking about is very little in the scheme of things,” Council Member Ann Kitchen said. This year, Austin’s 10 district council members are each making $83,158 – about the same as a sixth-year officer with the Austin Police Department. The last time the council approved a pay increase for themselves was in 2006, when a council member made $57,736 and the mayor made $67,981. Since then, they’ve received only cost-of-living increases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Democratic Party is suspending a longtime lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct from party-related activities at all levels and has called for state Sen. Gene Davis to step down from the Legislature. The decision, announced in a statement over the weekend, came after a former intern’s allegation exposed a rift in the party over its handling of sexual harassment. In prior statements, the party’s stance was that it couldn’t take action unless it received an official complaint, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Following Ms. Weglinski’s statement last week, party leaders and members of the Executive Committee spoke privately with Senator Davis,” Utah Democratic Party Executive Director Thom DeSirant wrote in the statement. “Though he denied specifics of the allegations in his interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, we believe the behavior he acknowledged, regardless of context or intent, was unacceptable. We requested he voluntarily step down.” University of Utah student Sonia Weglinski, a former intern who also worked on the senator’s reelection campaign this spring, said in an Aug. 3 Instagram post that Davis touched her in ways that made her feel uncomfortable on multiple occasions during the five months she worked with him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The certification of last week’s primary election results in Vermont has been delayed by a technical issue, the secretary of state’s office announced Tuesday. The statewide and federal primary election canvassing was expected to take place Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office said a state software contractor has been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks. The process is separate from the official counting of ballots and local certification by town clerks, the office said, adding that the delay does not impact its 100% confidence in the accuracy of the vote totals reported by town clerks. “The Secretary of State’s mission is to provide a secure and accurate election. The office will always default to a delay to ensure integrity and confidence of the results when they are certified,” the office said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An author’s investigative effort to uncover the origins of a racist photo on Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page has ended inconclusively, according to the author, who has written a book that offers new details about the 2019 scandal and the former governor’s remarkable political survival. “Of course, I would like to have determined exactly who was in the photograph. And I gave that my best effort,” Margaret Edds, a retired journalist and the author of “What the Eyes Can’t See,” told The Associated Press ahead of the book’s November publication. Although Edds – like journalists and two groups of law firm investigators before her – did not arrive at any definitive answer about the photo of one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume, her 296-page book offers a behind-the-scenes look at the turmoil the image sparked. The book details Northam’s decision to remain in office despite tremendous pressure, as well as the steps he took to become better informed about the legacy of racism, redeem his reputation and work with Black leaders to sharpen his administration’s focus on racial justice. Northam participated in 14 interviews for the book. “What the Eyes Can’t See” also draws on interviews with Northam’s wife, staffers, consultants, friends and public officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The West Seattle Bridge will open Sept. 18, according to the Seattle Department of Transportation. The date is the most specific milestone set by the city since the bridge closed more than two years ago due to safety concerns, and it provides weary West Seattle travelers with a beacon of hope. The city previously set the week of Sept. 12 as its window for reopening the bridge but hedged the announcement with caveats about possible unanticipated hiccups in the final stretch of construction. The date provided Thursday reflects the progress crews have made in recent months, most notably the final post-tensioning of nearly 50 miles of new cable, which compress the span of the bridge to strengthen the concrete, The Seattle Times reports. The cables are anchored by concrete blocks capable of holding 20 million pounds of force. SDOT previously hoped to open the bridge in July, but a labor strike of concrete workers delayed progress. The 40-year-old bridge is among the city’s most important, previously allowing 100,000 drivers and 20,000 transit users to move between West Seattle and the rest of the city every day.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is making it easier for residents to get a REAL ID ahead of the May 3 federal deadline. The department recently announced a new online service that offers a guided path through pre-enrollment and cuts the time spent at the DMV, according to a news release. REAL ID Headstart allows applicants to verify their identities, upload required documents, and schedule their REAL ID appointments online. While the federal REAL ID Act requires documents be presented in person, a change is in progress. Once the act is amended, the DMV aims to enhance REAL ID Headstart so that no in-person visit is needed. Congress passed the Real ID Act in 2005 to establish minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The updated identification cards will be required for airport check-in and to enter federal facilities. REAL ID Headstart is available at dmv.wv.gov.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state can’t impose property taxes on tribal lands that have changed hands unless it gets congressional approval, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The decision from a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marks another chapter in a lawsuit four Chippewa tribes from northern Wisconsin filed in 2018. The Lac Courte Oreilles, the Lac du Flambeau, the Red Cliff and the Bad River sued after the state imposed property taxes on land within their reservations. Such land is immune from state property taxes under an 1854 treaty, but the state argued that the land is eligible because tribal members sold it to non-American Indians before the land was were sold back to tribal members. The three-judge panel affirmed that the land isn’t taxable without congressional approval, saying only Congress can diminish tribes’ sovereignty, and the treaty is best read to promise tax immunity even for reacquired lands.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The tax incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act and a $2.5 billion infusion from Congress last year are spurring hopes of more carbon storage projects in the rolling prairie lands of northeastern Wyoming. Geologist Fred McLaughlin has been drilling nearly 2 miles into the ground, far deeper than the thick coal seams that make this the top coal-mining region in the United States. McLaughlin and his University of Wyoming colleagues are studying whether tiny spaces in rock deep underground can permanently store vast volumes of greenhouse gas emitted by a coal-fired power plant. The concept known as carbon storage has long been touted as an answer to global warming that preserves the energy industry’s burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity. One goal of McLaughlin’s project is to preserve the lifespan of a relatively new coal-fired power plant, Dry Fork Station, run by Basin Electric Power Cooperative. State officials hope it will do the same for the whole beleaguered coal industry that still underpins Wyoming’s economy. The state produces about 40% of the nation’s coal, but declining production and a series of layoffs and bankruptcies have beset the Gillette area’s vast, open-pit coal mines over the past decade.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/31/pumpkin-surgeons-wild-exhibit-white-house-groundskeeper-news-around-states/50888775/", "title": "Pumpkin surgeons, 'Wild' exhibit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the steamship owner responsible for illegally bringing 110 African captives to America aboard the last U.S. slave ship have ended generations of public silence, calling his actions more than 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” In a statement released to NBC News, members of Timothy Meaher’s family – which is still prominent around Mobile – said what Meaher did on the eve of the Civil War “had consequences that have impacted generations of people.” “Our family has been silent for too long on this matter. However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/30/mile-challenge-bean-field-ravine-mountain-lion-attack-news-around-states/118483226/", "title": "80-mile challenge, bean field ravine: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s top health official said Friday that he and his colleagues are “intensely frustrated” as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise, a surge he partly attributed to people who have refused to get vaccinated or change their behavior. The state is grappling with an intensive care unit bed shortage, and federal medical teams and mobile morgue units have been sent to hospitals in the South. “We are really in a crisis,” Health Officer Scott Harris said during his Friday briefing. “We’ve said that over and over for several weeks. We need people to understand that you, yourself – if you’re hearing these words – you’re the person who’s going to make a difference. You need to be responsible for your behavior. You need to do what it takes to not continue this situation. I don’t know how much longer we’re going to be able to do this.” Alabama ranks fourth for new cases per capita and continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. “So much of what we’re seeing is preventable,” Harris said. “We’re seeing this because people don’t want to get vaccinated, and they don’t want to change their behavior. They would rather have an argument about masks than have an argument about how we keep our children safe or how do we protect Alabama hospitals. It is very frustrating for all of us.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state last week reported its highest daily number of resident COVID-19 cases so far this year as health officials struggle to keep pace with coronavirus testing and contact tracing and as hospitals juggle a surge in patients with staff shortages and admissions for other conditions. Gov. Mike Dunleavy and members of his administration on Thursday announced plans aimed at increasing staffing to help with COVID-19 cases, including speeding the licensing process for health care workers and seeking federal contracts for more workers, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, said hospital staffing is a concern. Alaska reported 701 resident COVID-19 cases Thursday – one of the highest daily tallies since the start of the pandemic. That number may be lower than the real number of infections, health officials said, because of testing and contact tracing backlogs. According to the state hospital association, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 are nearing pandemic highs. Combined with staff shortages and busy summertime admissions, Alaska’s health care system faces the threat of being overwhelmed, providers and state officials said. Health care providers are deciding which patients get intensive care unit beds and are struggling to transfer severely ill patients elsewhere.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Supreme Court is eliminating the long-standing practice of allowing lawyers in criminal and civil trials in state courts to remove potential jurors without explanation, a move that proponents said would help prevent discrimination in the selection of trial jurors. So-called peremptory challenges will end Jan. 1, under a groundbreaking rule change ordered Tuesday and released Friday by the state’s highest court. In the meantime, a court task force will recommend possible changes to current court rules that also allow opposing sides in trials to ask judges to remove potential jurors for valid reasons such as stated bias or inability to serve, the order said. Peremptory challenges are a hot-button legal issue nationally, as illustrated by jury selection in the trial that resulted in the conviction of a former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death. Robert Chang, a Seattle University law professor, said he believed Arizona’s impending outright elimination of peremptory challenges is believed to be a first such step by a U.S. state, though others such as Washington and California have placed new restrictions on the challenges. “Arizona clearly has gone further,” said Chang, the director of a legal center that endorsed a competing Arizona rule-change proposal to restrict but not eliminate peremptory challenges.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: More than 3,100 active coronavirus cases have been reported in Arkansas public schools among students and employees, according to newly released numbers from the state. Most students returned to the classroom last week, and the majority of public school students attend districts that are requiring masks. Such rules emerged after a judge in Little Rock temporarily blocked a state law that bans mask mandates in schools and public places. The Arkansas Department of Health’s latest report on schools, released Thursday, found 3,102 active cases in 173 school districts in the state. The Bentonville, Springdale, Rogers, Cabot and Fort Smith districts all reported more than 100 active cases among students, faculty and staff. A week ago, the state reported just under 1,800 active cases at schools. Meanwhile, a judge in Lonoke County on Friday ruled against a group of parents who sued to block Cabot schools’ mask requirement. Circuit Judge Barbara Elmore wrote that most of the parents who sued had already received mask exemptions for their children or withdrawn them from the district, so she denied their request to block the requirement. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalabasas: A mountain lion that attacked a 5-year-old boy and dragged the child across his front lawn was shot and killed by a wildlife officer, authorities said Saturday. The 65-pound mountain lion attacked the boy while he was playing near his house Thursday in Calabasas and “dragged him about 45 yards” across the lawn, said Capt. Patrick Foy, a spokesman with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The boy suffered significant traumatic injuries to his head and upper torso but was in stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital, Foy said. “The true hero of this story is his mom because she absolutely saved her son’s life,” Foy said. The mother was inside the house when she heard commotion outside. “She ran out of the house and started punching and striking the mountain lion with her bare hands and got him off her son,” he said. The parents immediately drove the boy to the hospital, where law enforcement was notified of the attack and sent a wildlife officer to the scene. Once at the house, the officer discovered a mountain lion crouching in the bushes with its “ears back and hissing” at him, Foy said. Subsequent DNA tests confirmed that the lion was the one responsible for attacking the child, the wildlife department said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Jurors convicted two former sheriff’s deputies accused of causing the death of an intoxicated man by placing him on his stomach and squeezing him into a van to take him to a detox center. Former Boulder County sheriff’s deputies James O’Brien, 52, and Adam Lunn, 39, were found guilty Friday of manslaughter in the death of Demetrius Shankling, 23, in 2018, the Longmont Times-Call reports. According to an arrest affidavit, they put the 6-foot-tall man, with his hands behind his back, in a compartment that was less than 5 feet long. O’Brien and Lunn had to press on the compartment door to close it, causing Shankling’s leg to get wedged against the inside of the door, the affidavit said. When they reached the detox center the early hours of Sept. 9, 2018, Shankling was unresponsive and not breathing. He died after spending 27 days in a coma, Senior Deputy District Attorney Christian Gardner-Wood said. An autopsy found that Shankling died of suffocation because of his positioning, with alcohol and amphetamine as contributing factors.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s plan for using $110 million in federal pandemic relief funds to reopen K-12 schools for in-person learning, while addressing the effects of lost instructional time last school year and reducing education gaps over the long term, has been approved by the federal government, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday released the remaining $369 million in federal pandemic relief funds for education to the state. With this latest batch, Connecticut will have received approximately $1.1 billion under the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, according to federal figures. The state previously received $737 million in March. When combined with other federal COVID-19 relief funds for education, Connecticut has received roughly $1.7 billion since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Education. “This historic level of funding allows us, as one educational community, to be bold and innovative as we forge our path to a transformative and equitable recovery,” Connecticut Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials are now asking New Castle County residents to “squish on sight” if they see an invasive spotted lanternfly. The county’s population of the bug has surpassed the level for which the Delaware Department of Agriculture recommends reporting, Delaware State News reports. In Kent and Sussex counties, officials are still asking those who spot adult lanternflies to report them for verification. Spotted lanternflies pose a risk to the grape, orchard, nursery and landscape, and hardwood industries, Stephen Hauss, an environmental scientist with the state Department of Agriculture’s Plant Industries Section, told the newspaper. Native to China, India and Vietnam, the insect is about 1 inch long and half an inch wide at rest. Its forewings are gray with black spots, and the hindwings are red with black spots. The insect was first found in North America in 2014. The first one in Delaware was spotted in 2017, Hauss told the newspaper. Between 2018 and 2019, the insect’s numbers took off, especially in New Castle County.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands of voting rights advocates rallied across the country Saturday to call for sweeping federal laws that would wipe out voting restrictions advancing in some GOP-controlled states that could make it harder to cast a ballot. The rallies, held in dozens of cities, were intended to increase pressure on Democrats to rewrite procedural rules that would allow Democrats to pass the legislation without Republican votes. But they were also aimed at coaxing President Joe Biden to become a more forceful advocate on the issue. “You said the night you won that Black America had your back and that you were going to have Black Americans’ backs,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, who helped organize the national demonstrations, said at a rally in Washington. “Well, Mr. President, they’re stabbing us in the back.” More than a thousand people turned out in sweltering heat on the National Mall on Saturday, the 58th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. His son Martin Luther King III used the occasion to call on the Senate to scrap the filibuster rule. “Our country is backsliding to the unconscionable days of Jim Crow. And some of our senators are saying, ‘Well, we can’t overcome the filibuster,’ ” King told the crowd. “I say to you today: Get rid of the filibuster. That is a monument to white supremacy we must tear down.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Mounting deaths from the latest COVID-19 surge have strained capacity at hospital morgues and funeral homes across central Florida. While the state’s record levels of new cases and hospitalizations for the disease have leveled off over the past week, averages of daily reported deaths have continued to climb. Hospitals across Florida have reported to the federal government that roughly 279 patients have died every day for the past week, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, though that figure includes deaths suspected, but not yet confirmed, to have been from COVID-19. The figure just a month ago was 52 deaths per day. AdventHealth’s hospitals in central Florida are scrambling to secure additional resources to deal with the surge in deaths, said the hospital group’s spokesperson, Jeff Granger. The Orlando Sentinel reports the health system had reached morgue capacity at 10 of its hospitals in five counties: Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole and Volusia. “We have begun utilizing rented, refrigerated coolers at 10 of our campuses,” the hospital group said in an email obtained by the newspaper. “These coolers are quickly becoming filled also.” Funeral directors also warned that their facilities are being overwhelmed, according to numerous news outlets.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court’s ruling that said requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications does not amount to an unconstitutional poll tax. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter filed a lawsuit in April 2020 saying that Georgia’s postage requirement for absentee ballots and ballot applications effectively imposes a poll tax and is therefore unconstitutional. The challenge was brought on behalf of voters and a group seeking to empower communities of color, the Black Voters Matter Fund. “We hold that the fact that absentee voters in Georgia who decide to vote by mail must pay their own postage is not a ‘tax’ or unconstitutional fee on voting,” Circuit Judge Elizabeth Branch wrote in the opinion for a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That affirmed an August 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta. “We are disappointed in the outcome. The ACLU of Georgia will continue to protect the sacred fundamental right to vote,” ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. Totenberg had acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during the pandemic, but said the fact that it’s available means the postage requirement is not tantamount to an unconstitutional poll tax.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: In an effort to address vaccine hesitancy, a group of businesses and nonprofits launched a public service campaign Thursday aimed at Native Hawaiians, many of whom harbor a deep distrust of the government dating back to the U.S.-supported overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. The campaign reminds Hawaiians that they were nearly wiped out by disease in the 1800s and that the kingdom’s rulers at the time pushed people to get vaccinated against smallpox. About 20 Hawaiian leaders stood in rows 6 feet apart Thursday at a statue of Queen Lili’uokalani, the kingdom’s last monarch, imploring people to wear masks and get vaccinated to ensure the survival of the Indigenous people of Hawaii. Meanwhile, as visitors continue to fly to Hawaii and locals go about their business, state officials say the islands may need to go into lockdown if the surge in coronavirus cases linked to the delta variant continues. County mayors are asking for more restrictions, and Gov. David Ige told Hawaii News Now on Thursday that strict mandates are being considered. If case counts continue to rise, “and we push the hospitals across that line, then we will have to go to more extreme measures, lockdowns and potentially shutting businesses,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has been ordered to turn over several public documents regarding her education task force to journalists after a judge found she had no legitimate reason to withhold the materials. In a scathing ruling Thursday, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler said McGeachin’s attempts at withholding the documents from public view were so baseless and frivolous that her office should pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees plus an additional $750 penalty. “If public officials were required to disclose public records only to those, including media, they believe will support the government’s actions, we will have shed the principals of our democracy and evolved into an autocratic state where criticism of public officials is not permitted,” Hippler wrote. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July, after several journalists said they were wrongly denied access to public records about her newly created Education Task Force charged with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. McGeachin’s office responded to some of the requests well past the time limits set by state law and denied many of the records under a variety of exemptions, some so irrelevant – including one specific to fishing and hunting licenses – that it appeared she “may have blindly selected them at random,” the judge wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials on Friday accused DoorDash and Grubhub of harming restaurants and their customers by charging high fees and through other deceptive practices when delivery and takeout business became essential to the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. The officials believe their lawsuits against the delivery companies are the most sweeping of their kind brought by a city. “It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times, using unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. Representatives for the two companies called the lawsuits filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court “baseless.” Delivery companies have been the target of legal authorities in other cities and states before, but those efforts have targeted specific policies, compared to Chicago’s attack on numerous elements of the companies’ operations. According to the lawsuits, both companies advertise delivery services for restaurants without their agreement, hurting the businesses’ reputation when customers are unhappy about the cost or service. City investigators also found that they charge higher prices than restaurants set on their own menus and charge more fees than initially disclosed.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A statue of a top Indiana suffragist has been erected outside the library where she trained and organized other activists for women’s right to vote. The bronze likeness of Marie Stuart Edwards was unveiled Thursday at the Peru Public Library, where Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch and Edwards’ two grandsons spoke about her dedication to the cause. The statue depicts a young Edwards standing by her bicycle and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, gazing into the distance with a look of determination, the Kokomo Tribune reports. Crouch said women like Edwards made it possible for her to become the state’s second in command. “We here in this crowd are able to participate in the democratic process, all of us, because of Marie Stewart Edwards,” she said. “We have her, and all that she did and all that she stood for, to thank for our ability to stand here as equals.” In February 1920, Edwards helped found the nationwide League of Women Voters. Within a year, about 2 million women had joined the nonpartisan organization that pushed to educate women about their new rights as voters. Congress passed the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote in August 1920. Work on the $105,000 statue and pocket park surrounding it began after Rediscover Downtown Peru was awarded a $35,000 grant last year to help pay for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s chief justice on Friday signed an order making masks mandatory in areas controlled by the courts, a contrast to a state law that bans similar mandates in public schools where children have resumed classes amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases. The order signed by Chief Justice Susan Christensen said all people entering court-controlled areas must wear a face covering regardless of vaccination status. “This requirement applies statewide and does not depend on a particular county’s or area’s positivity rate or transmission status,” Christensen wrote. She said the Iowa Supreme Court reviewed recent revisions to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding mask-wearing in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. The order contradicts Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ long-term policy against mask mandates. In May, she signed a law that bans cities, counties and school districts from requiring masks. Reynolds has been put on notice by U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, who said in a letter last week that the Iowa law is “against science-based strategies for preventing the spread of COVID-19.” Reynolds lashed out at President Joe Biden after receiving the letter and suggested the CDC has no scientific proof masks stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state agency is pushing to process hundreds of applications for coronavirus relief funds from renters facing eviction and their landlords after spending weeks this spring hiring and training more than 100 new employees to do the work. The state’s Housing Resources Corporation is handling the bulk of the emergency rental assistance in Kansas, and most of its money hasn’t yet been distributed. Questions about how quickly tenants’ overdue rent and utility bills are being paid off became even more compelling late Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a federal moratorum on evictions. States, cities and counties have until 2025 to spend some of the dollars, but the federal government hoped for 65% of the first tranche of aid – $15.7 billion total – to go out before Oct. 1. Although the state’s largest city, Wichita, has hit that target with its own program, the Kansas housing agency, like such agencies in most states and most cities and counties with their own programs, was far short at the end of July, the U.S. Treasury Department reported last week. “It’s just not getting the money to people fast enough,” said Dustin Hare, an organizer for the tenant advocacy group Rent Zero Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and several other elected Republicans joined a “freedom rally” Saturday, where they disparaged COVID-19 restrictions and Gov. Andy Beshear in front of a supportive crowd. Massie, Kentucky Auditor Mike Harmon, and state Reps. Josh Calloway, Savannah Maddox and Felicia Rabourn gathered on the steps of the State Capitol and took turns giving speeches to a crowd of at least 300 people. The rally came at the end of a week when Kentucky repeatedly broke grim records for the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19. “COVID is a serious disease,” Massie said during his speech, noting he has known people who died from it. “But there’s another disease, another virus, in the state of Kentucky. ... It’s called the Beshear virus.” The congressman joked he thought former Gov. Matt Bevin had gotten rid of the “Beshear virus” when he succeeded former Gov. Steve Beshear as the state’s top official. But then the commonwealth ended up catching the “Andy variant,” he said, referring to Andy Beshear, the son of Steve Beshear who followed in his father’s footsteps. Symptoms of the “Andy variant” include “loss of balance in your bank account” and confusion, Massie joked. At one point he derisively referred to masks as “face diapers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A man is celebrating his 80th birthday by cycling 80 miles a day for 10 days straight. His personal challenge began last Tuesday and will continue through this Thursday. Phil Baker’s actual birthday is Aug. 28. He travels a route that largely uses River Road, with some variations, to take him 40 miles from home and then 40 miles back. He leaves his house at 5:15 a.m. and gets back about 10:30 a.m. A fellow cyclist is riding with him each day. Baker, a lifelong athlete who’s competed in Ironman triathlons, began training for his birthday-week rides about a year ago. He had been walking and hiking up to 20 miles a day, to take a break from cycling, then picked up the bike again, starting his training by traveling 10 miles in an hour, then slowly increasing his speed over longer periods of time. “I got up from 10 miles to 20, 25 miles, then 30 and 35 miles, and up to 40 and 50 miles for a longer length of riding,” Baker said. “It wasn’t all done in an hour, but the hour goal was a way to start.” Baker said he also bought a “brand new, beautiful bike” – a Canyon bike he admires that’s used by one of the teams in the Tour de France. A local bike shop helped Baker adjust the bike seat and handle bars to fit him, he said. “It’s all about where you are on the bike,” Baker said. “Fit is everything.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s annual bear hunt gets started for the season Monday as hunters prepare for another year of pandemic-era fall hunting. The Maine bear hunt runs from Monday to Nov. 27, though most of the season takes place between now and Sept. 25. That’s the period of the season in which it’s legal to hunt bears using bait. The season kicked off Saturday with Youth Bear Day, which is reserved for young hunters. The state’s other big fall hunting seasons for deer, moose and wild turkey will begin later in the fall. Maine officials have encouraged more hunting during the pandemic because it’s an outdoor activity that easily lends itself to social distancing.\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport: A select group of inmates is being trained by national experts to restore weathered and disturbed gravestones at a historic cemetery. Officials announced the initiative Friday in Williamsport, saying it would provide the inmates an opportunity to learn stone masonry skills that pay between $20 to $35 an hour in Maryland. The work will take place at Riverview Cemetery, where more than a dozen headstones were damaged last month in a case still under investigation. The plan outlined Friday also calls for inmates to clean all the gravestones and reset them, as many have become destabilized over the years. Craig Rickets, 54, was one of the inmates from the Maryland Correctional Training Center south of Hagerstown who has been involved. Of all the jobs he’s done through prison training programs – including landscaping, shipping and handling, and janitorial work – Rickets said restoring gravestones was the most “productive.” “It makes me feel like I have new life,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit challenging a requirement that students at the University of Massachusetts campuses in Boston and Lowell be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to return to campus. Students at the schools sued in July, asking the judge to find the vaccination mandates to be unconstitutional. The UMass Boston student also alleged she was improperly denied a religious exemption. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said the schools have a strong interest in reducing the spread of the disease. And she found that despite the students’ assertion that the policy is “arbitrary or not based in science,” the schools “based the decision upon both medical and scientific evidence and research and guidance and thus is at least rationally related to these legitimate interests.” The judge also noted that students who refuse to get vaccinated may still take online classes or defer their enrollment a semester. But even if the policy meant they would be deprived of a UMass education, their argument still fails, she said. “Moreover, the balance of equities tips in Defendants’ favor given the strong public interest here that they are promoting – preventing further spread of COVID-19 on campus, a virus which has infected and taken the lives of thousands of Massachusetts residents,” she wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nEagle Harbor: A group of Michigan Tech University alumni have submitted the winning bid for a former U.S. Air Force radar station in the Upper Peninsula that they hope can become a tourist destination. The bid was $227,000, The Daily Mining Gazette reports, citing a statement from Keweenaw County, which controls the property. The former base, which has more than 100 acres in Eagle Harbor Township, is known locally as Mount Horace Greeley. For nearly 40 years, it served as a radar station during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The winning bidder was identified as Zach Garner of Perry, who said he submitted an offer on behalf of himself and Michigan Tech alumni who are engineers. The school is 30 miles away in Houghton. “We are passionate about the Keweenaw Peninsula and respectful of the deep history rooted in the area, including this site itself,” said a letter that accompanied the bid. The goal is to address any environmental issues at the former base, employ local residents and turn the land into a tourism spot, the letter said. The group said it has “dreamt for years about the prospect of turning the aforementioned property into a destination that anyone and everyone can enjoy.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nClimax: Some consider it a geological wonder. A crack in the soil of a bean field in northwestern Minnesota has caused the ground to collapse 25 feet, creating a quarter-mile-long ravine. Wayne and Erllene Erickson are the fourth generation on the family farm near Climax in Polk County and say they’ve never seen anything like it, WDAY-TV reports. “(It’s) kind of scary. It is sad, sad to see it,” said Erllene Erickson as she surveyed the fallen bean field. “Mother Nature does what she wants.” The fallen land is pushing under the river bank, sending more dirt into the Red River. Wayne Erickson is trying to make sense of what happened on his farm. “When I drove out here, it looked like the Grand Canyon. We didn’t have all that slumping going on; it was just straight down. Straight up and down,” Erickson said. Geologists with the University of North Dakota say the dry weather, a drop in water levels on the Red River and recent rains can form a perfect storm for something like this to occur. Crevasses are still forming as the land continues shifting. Soil experts were expected to visit the field to study the natural phenomenon.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The board governing the state’s public universities voted Friday not to require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 despite the objections of the two medical doctors who are part of the board. During a special meeting, nine members of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees said the vaccine should not be mandated. Many said they support students getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but shots should be voluntary. Dr. Alfred McNair Jr. and Dr. Steven Cunningham were the only two board members who voted to mandate inoculations. “This volunteer thing is ridiculous,” said McNair, who is chief of medical staff at Biloxi Regional Medical Center. “If they had polio, it wouldn’t be a volunteer thing.” Mississippi’s public universities already mandate that students be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, according to Institutions of Higher Learning bylaws. Students studying in a health-related field must be vaccinated against hepatitis B. McNair said cases among young people are rising in the state, and he’s seeing children hospitalized with more severe symptoms than ever before. He said people who recover from the coronavirus can have long-term side effects.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Intensive care units are nearly full across the area, creating challenges for hospitals battling to keep up with the high number of COVID-19 patients. The Kansas City Star reports 215 ICU beds in the region were in use last week – the most since the onset of the pandemic – and that number has grown almost every day since. As of Wednesday, 224 people were hospitalized in ICUs, according to hospital data tracked by the Mid-America Regional Council, a regional planning agency. The data includes hospitals in Jackson and Clay counties in Missouri and Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas. Kansas City isn’t unique in Missouri. Data posted Friday on the state’s COVID-19 dashboard showed 690 ICU patients across the state among 2,395 people hospitalized with COVID-19. On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson rescinded the COVID-19 related state of emergency that was put in place March 13, 2020, and replaced it with a narrower state of emergency that focuses on the health care system. Parson, a Republican, said in a statement that the changes acknowledge the progress the state has made when it comes to the pandemic, particularly now that vaccines are available. But he continued regulatory and other procedures that will allow the still-struggling health care system to respond to increased caseloads.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Several parents are suing Missoula public schools over a mask requirement as the school year is set to begin amid a new wave of COVID-19 cases. An attorney representing parents of students in Missoula said the requirement is in violation of the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades said Thursday that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override that individual right. Kevin Twidwell, an attorney at the Kaleva law office representing the schools, said they disagree with the allegation that face coverings violate the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. An online fundraiser organized to cover the costs of filing the lawsuit raised $10,000 as of Thursday. Matt Stivers, who donated $100, wrote that his son has difficulty breathing while wearing a mask because of a heart defect. “Kids need to see each others’ faces and deserve a normal experience in school. They are being deprived of non-verbal communication with other students,” Stivers wrote on the fundraiser page. The Missoula County Public Schools Board of Trustees voted earlier this month to approve the mask mandate for the first six weeks of school.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The Nebraska State Fair has kicked off and will offer a full slate of attractions and music a year after the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the annual event’s concerts, carnival and other draws. Besides the rides, gooey fried food and livestock shows, this year’s fair in Grand Island will feature a bevy of concerts, including Modern West featuring Kevin Costner on Thursday, BandaLos Sebastianes on Friday and Jon Pardi on Saturday. Warrant and Skid Row, both wildly popular “hair bands” in the 1980s, will perform Tuesday in the Events Center. The theme of this year’s state fair is “Nothing More Nebraskan,” and the event will run through Sept. 6. Executive Director Bill Ogg said this year’s fair has more 4-H entries and FFA exhibitors than it had in 2019. “So there’s a rebound effect,” Ogg told the Grand Island Independent. “We should have one of the strongest participation years in 4-H and FFA.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An equestrian supply store has sold out of a drug primarily used to deworm horses that vaccine skeptics are peddling as a remedy to the coronavirus. V & V Tack and Feed no longer has any of the drug, ivermectin, KTNV-Las Vegas reports. The store in the northwestern Las Vegas metropolitan area fields multiple calls daily about whether it has the drug in stock and now requires customers to show proof that they own horses to buy it. Store associate Shelley Smith told the TV station that people coming into the store have told her they were taking the drug for coronavirus and experiencing side effects including loss of vision. “You should not be taking this product. This is not for humans to take. This is to treat parasites in horses,” Smith said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a health advisory Thursday urging people against taking ivermectin, saying that poison control centers had experienced a five-fold increase in calls for symptoms ranging from hallucinations and confusion to gastrointestinal issues. The Southern Nevada Health District warned people Wednesday that, although the drug could be used to treat conditions like head lice and worms in humans, taking doses manufactured for horses could result in hospitalization or death.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Lottery generated a record $518.5 million in total sales in the fiscal year ending June 30, officials said. It surpassed its previous record from the last fiscal year of $392.2 million. “With an expanded menu of games, new offerings like KENO 603, sports betting through our collaboration with DraftKings, NH iLottery, and a consistent focus on engaging our current audience and tapping into new markets, we feel confident we have positioned the New Hampshire Lottery for continued success and growth as we look toward the future,” Charlie McIntyre, the lottery’s executive director, said in a statement. The New Hampshire Lottery and DraftKings launched mobile sports betting in the state in December 2019, and retail locations followed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former government official who says she is a sexual assault survivor is demanding that the Republican gubernatorial candidate stop using her story as a “political prop” in a campaign video that bashes Gov. Phil Murphy. Katie Brennan, who has said she was sexually assaulted by a peer while they both worked on Murphy’s behalf in 2017, said Friday that she wasn’t consulted before Jack Ciattarelli launched PhilMurphyDoesNotCare.com. The site prominently features a video of Brennan publicly testifying before legislators and charges that Murphy uses women as “political props.” She said in a tweet earlier she wasn’t a prop or a pawn herself. “Take it down,” she said Friday. “I wasn’t consulted prior to the creation of the website and the ad campaign, and had I been, would have expressed my displeasure with it. It looks like an endorsement of the Ciattarelli campaign, which is not my intent,” she said in a phone interview. “There is a way to hold people accountable and talk about the mistakes of the past and what their vision and plans for betterment and equity and reform are in the future without dragging me into the fight in a way that I certainly did not ask to be.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state is flush with cash due to a quick recovery of oil and gas markets and higher-than-expected gross receipts tax revenues as consumers spend federal pandemic relief checks and tap into other recovery aid, state finance officials and legislative analysts said. The officials briefed a key panel of state lawmakers Friday and said while revenues are expected to hit record levels for the next fiscal year, the pandemic remains a risk factor that still has the potential to derail economic recovery if cases continue to surge or shutdowns are imposed again. While widespread shutdowns are not likely, the forecast shows what analysts described as a significant upward revision in recurring revenues for the current fiscal year – up more than $632 million from estimates made just six months ago. Nearly $1.4 billion in new money is expected for the 2023 fiscal year, marking growth of nearly 19%. That means lawmakers will have more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs. It also means more money is expected to be funneled into the state’s permanent endowments. Some lawmakers warned that the federal recovery aid won’t be around forever and urged others on the Legislative Finance Committee to keep building the state’s reserves.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Cutting-edge DNA technology will be used to analyze the remains of more than 1,100 victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center that have yet to be identified. Newsday reported Saturday that the New York City medical examiner’s office has been approved to use the forensic method known as Next Generation Sequencing, which is already being used by the Department of Defense to identify remains from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. Thousands of human remains from Sept. 11 have yet to be identified because they’re too damaged and degraded to be analyzed by conventional methods. They’re currently being stored at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. The medical examiner’s office could begin using the process before the end of the year, Mark Desire, chief of the office’s missing persons and body identification unit, told the newspaper. While the remains of about 1,600 of the 2,754 World Trace Center victims have been identified, the process has slowed over the years, and the last identification was made in 2019. The medical examiner’s office began studying Next Generation Sequencing in 2018, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the approval process until this year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A panel of state trial judges refused Friday to halt its order restoring voting rights for tens of thousands of residents convicted of felonies whose current punishments don’t include prison time. The three judges denied the delay sought by attorneys for top Republican lawmakers on the same day the panel’s majority filed an explanation about why they authorized voting access for potentially 56,000 offenders in North Carolina otherwise unable to cast ballots. One of the judges announced that decision earlier last week, in advance of a written order. GOP lawmakers wanted the temporary delay while they appeal the ruling. A trial concluded last week in a lawsuit filed in 2019 by several civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. The two Superior Court judges who agreed to issue Friday’s preliminary injunction wrote that the harm the offenders alleged they would experience by having to wait another election without voting was “both substantial and irreparable.” Friday’s order said election officials can’t deny voter registration to any convicted felon who is on probation, parole or post-release supervision.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Human cases of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus are on the rise in the state, with the severity of symptoms resulting in some hospitalizations, according to health officials. So far, five people have confirmed cases, with four in the hospital, as well as two of six people with pending cases. The confirmed cases are in Cass, Mercer, Sargeant and Stutsman counties, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, body aches or rash. People with severe cases may experience a stiff neck, altered mental status, paralysis, coma and possibly death, health officials said. Most people infected with West Nile experience no symptoms. The number of West Nile cases in North Dakota varies year by year, with seven confirmed human cases last year and nine in 2019. But in 2018 there were 204. “Peak WNV activity historically has occurred in August,” state Department of Health epidemiologist Amanda Bakken said. “This is the time to be vigilant and take precautions, not just when people are aware mosquitoes are biting them.” Three of the five confirmed cases in people this year have affected the nervous system. “Because our cases have had particularly severe symptoms … it is especially important that people protect themselves,” Bakken said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s correctional agency terminated seven employees Friday after officials say prison guards used excessive and unjustified force against a Black inmate before he died in custody in February. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction sent a notice of removal to five corrections officers, a supervisor and a licensed nurse following an investigation into the in-custody death of 55-year-old Michael McDaniel. Security footage released by the agency in July showed McDaniel collapsing on his own and being taken down to the floor by prison guards at least 16 times before he died at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, a Columbus suburb, on Feb. 6. “We’re responsible for what happened in that video,” director Annette Chambers-Smith told reporters in July, after releasing surveillance footage of the incident. “There is no question about that.” One of the officers involved, Heath Causey, is accused in the records released Friday of performing a “take-down” of McDaniel while the inmate was being escorted outside without shoes and a coat and while wearing a ripped T-shirt, “causing his body to veer off the walking path and land face-down in a snow-covered area.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city must pay nearly $1 million to five attorneys who successfully challenged an anti-panhandling ordinance adopted by the city, a federal judge ruled last week. U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton issued the order approving 2,474 billable hours that attorneys spent on the case for a total of $986,350. A federal appeals court determined in 2020 that the ordinance placing restrictions on panhandling on street medians is an unconstitutional violation of free speech. Plaintiffs included two homeless men who used the medians to panhandle, including one who sold issues of the Curbside Chronicle newspaper, two joggers, a journalist, and a community activist who has used medians to protest and erect signs for his legislative candidacy. Several attorneys for the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union were among those who represented the plaintiffs. “We hope this fee amount will deter Oklahoma City from violating the constitutional rights of Oklahomans and encourage them to consider the concerns of the community in the future,” Megan Lambert, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Oklahoma, said in a statement. “We will continue our fight for the free speech rights of all Oklahomans.”\n\nOregon\n\nSpringfield: A COVID-19 outbreak at an assisted living facility that has infected 64 people and killed five began with an unvaccinated worker, public health officials said. The outbreak at Gateway Living in Springfield began July 5. The facility has 105 employees and 101 residents; only 63% of the staff and 82% of the residents are completely vaccinated. Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis said the outbreak began with an unvaccinated employee who worked while infectious. The outbreak arrived as an immense surge of coronavirus cases hit Oregon, driven by the especially contagious delta variant as well as vaccine obstinacy in some quarters. COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased 990% in Oregon since July 9, according to health officials. Many hospitals have canceled elective surgeries, and some patients are housed in hallways instead of rooms. More than 90% of the state’s intensive care and hospital beds are full, and health officials say the overwhelming majority of people hospitalized are unvaccinated. The state is deploying crisis teams of hundreds of nurses, respiratory therapists, paramedics and nursing assistants to the hardest hit regions. Officials in Tillamook County said Friday they no longer have capacity to store the bodies of the dead and are asking for refrigerated morgue trucks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A juvenile detention center in western Pennsylvania will close next month after state officials revoked its license. Allegheny County Manager William McKain says the Shuman Juvenile Detention Center in Pittsburgh will close Sept. 18. Youths being housed there will likely be transferred to other facilities the state operates, but specific plans have not yet been disclosed. The state’s human services department notified the county Friday that the license for the 46-year-old facility was being revoked. Officials cited the center’s “continued failure to follow regulations and failure to improve on past violations.” The Shuman Center’s fourth provisional license was issued July 1 and was set to expire Jan. 1, 2022. Provisional licenses are issued to facilities where violations are found so that the sites have time to address the problems, officials said. Shuman has been operating under a provisional license since December 2015. The latest violations, stemming from an investigation between June 16 and July 1, included a heroin overdose and the theft of $140 from a nurse’s purse when a child was left unattended. Twenty children and young adults were being held at the facility as of last Monday. They range in age from 14 to 20.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has made it easier for retired nurses and other health care workers to reenter the workforce without affecting their pension. Gov. Dan McKee signed the executive order Thursday to make sure there are enough health care professionals during the pandemic. Many hospitals have experienced staffing shortages, and there are concerns about another resurgence of coronavirus cases caused by the delta variant. If a retiree is determined by the state Department of Health to have the skills necessary to address the pandemic, the agency can provide a written certification that their reemployment is of finite duration and is necessitated by the good faith belief that their skills are needed, the order says. McKee previously said that workers at state-licensed health care facility are required to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 1. There have been protests against the requirement. The state is also preparing a field hospital Cranston for possible reopening if it is needed to help handle a surge in new cases. The site originally opened in December and was taken out of service in March but kept stocked with medical equipment and other supplies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The daily numbers of new COVID-19 cases are reaching levels only seen in the worst days of the pandemic before vaccines were widely available, leading hospitals to warn that unless the spike in cases is curbed soon, there will be dire consequences. There were 6,697 new cases of the disease reported Friday in South Carolina, the Department of Health and Environmental Control reported. The only days with more cases reported since the pandemic started 18 months ago were 7,680 cases on Jan. 6 and 7,450 on Jan. 8. “The expected surge in new cases once children returned to school across South Carolina and the proliferation of the highly transmissible delta variant has fueled a spike that requires our attention and legislative consideration of the removal of masking restrictions,” the health agency wrote in a statement. The Republican-dominated General Assembly in June passed an item in the state budget threating to take state money away from school districts that require masks. Back then, South Carolina was averaging 150 new COVID-19 cases a day. Now that average is above 4,500 new cases. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is one of the biggest defenders of the mask ban and hasn’t directly addressed the pandemic since Aug. 9.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Four universities are partnering on a new center to disrupt criminal networks. The schools will use a $4 million state grant to create the Center for Understanding and Disrupting the Illicit Economy. South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota State University in Brookings, Dakota State University in Madison, and the University of South Dakota in Vermillion are involved in the project. Dr. Jon Kellar, a professor at South Dakota Mines, will lead a team focused on identifying counterfeit goods, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Kellar said it’s a widespread problem that can have big implications. “Let’s say you buy a counterfeit purse – you think, well, I got a good deal, and it looks good. And, well, you probably think it’s a victimless crime,” he said. “Well, in fact, those products are being used by terrorists to generate cash to fund their networks.” Kellar said it’s important to be a conscientious consumer. “The first rule of thumb is if it seems too good to be true, it probably is,” he said. “You’ll notice some of the packaging may not look right; there may be misspellings. Or instead of a regular branded box, it comes in a white bag with some cheese cloth.” Researchers will also focus on tracking fake pharmaceuticals and exploring the dark web and other networks used by criminals.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State House Speaker Cameron Sexton has announced the members selected to serve on the House’s redistricting committee. According to a news release, Sexton’s office on Thursday said the committee will include eight Republicans and four Democrats. Deputy Speaker Curtis Johnson, R-Clarksville, will chair the committee, and Speaker Pro Tempore Pat Marsh, R-Shelbyville, will be the committee’s vice chair. “The makeup of this panel is representative of the distinctive voices of Tennesseans from across all three grand divisions of our state,” Sexton, R-Crossville, said in a statement. Lawmakers will use newly released U.S. Census Bureau data to redraw state and congressional districts currently dominated by Republicans. The proposals will be taken up in the 2022 legislative session that begins in January. Republican Gov. Bill Lee has veto power over the finalized plan, but he’s not expected to put up many objections.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The University of Texas is providing cash and other prizes to encourage UT community members to get COVID-19 shots. UT students, staff and faculty who have received at least one vaccine dose at any location can upload their vaccine card on UT’s portal to be eligible to enter into the university’s weekly prize drawing. The drawings will occur from Sept. 3 to Oct. 8, and the prizes will vary each week, according to UT’s Protect Texas website. Prizes for students include up to $10,000 in cash, gift cards, parking permits, wireless headphones, tickets to a home football game with UT President Jay Hartzell, and various other prizes. Faculty and staff members can win cash prizes up to $500, coolers, tumblers and the opportunity to take a tour of the new Moody Center with UT athletic director Chris Del Conte. UT is encouraging but not requiring community members to get vaccinated and wear masks. Gov. Greg Abbott has prohibited agencies that receive public funding in Texas from instituting vaccine and mask requirements. UT spokeswoman Eliska Padilla said the incentive program, which was announced Thursday and is funded by gifts from a variety of donors, aims to increase the vaccination rates of 18- to 24-year-olds. She said UT has no plans to incentivize vaccinations after Oct. 8.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Hospitals operated by Intermountain Healthcare have hit 100% capacity at their intensive care units because of increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19, and doctors and nurses are growing increasingly frustrated. During a live update Friday, Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious disease physician, said health care workers are seeing two growing trends: children with COVID-19 and severe infection in those seeming to be young and healthy. “Children’s Hospitals are seeing more COVID cases this round and more children coming in because of it,” Webb said. Statewide, 16 children have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past week, according to the Utah Department of Health, with 1,132 children ages 5 to 13 having tested positive. There were 467 people hospitalized overall as of Friday, including 184 who were in intensive care units. One reason that more children are contracting COVID could be the high amounts of exposure in classrooms and social gatherings, Webb said. However, the different coronavirus variants have also played a role in higher infection rates across the board, not just in children. “Delta is simply a different disease in some ways than the other variants,” Webb said.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: Farmers and their crews from around the state are ready to battle in the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont’s sixth annual Farmer Olympics. The event will be held Tuesday at Honeyfield Farm in Norwich. Teams will compete in skills ranging from physical to cerebral to ridiculous, organizers said. Among the past events were the zucchini relay, squash shot put and blindfolded seeding. Awards will go to the best-performing teams. “The Farmer Olympics are all about joy, celebration and connection, and this year, after the challenges farmers faced over the last 18 months, this event is really needed,” said Zea Luce, NOFA-VT’s events and engagement coordinator. Farms can register teams through NOFA-VT.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: Liberty University announced a temporary campuswide quarantine Thursday amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. The quarantine is set to begin Monday and last until Sept. 10, news outlets report. The university has about 15,000 students and 5,000 faculty or staff on campus. There were 159 known, active cases among students, faculty and staff as of Wednesday, according to the university’s online COVID-19 dashboard. Of those cases, 124 cases were among students. It was a sharp increase from the prior week, when 40 students and staff tested positive for the coronavirus as students were welcomed back to campus. It also surpasses the highest confirmed active caseload last September, when at least 141 people on campus tested positive, and nearly 1,200 people were quarantined. As the university began its fall semester last week, the university, which doesn’t require vaccination, lifted building capacity restrictions and distancing and masking requirements. The university changed its protocol late Thursday to enact the campuswide quarantine, moving classes online and suspending large indoor gatherings. Outdoor events will continue as scheduled, and worship services will move to the stadium.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state judge struck a measure on homelessness from the November ballot even as the city remains mired in a long-term humanitarian crisis. The so-called Compassion Seattle proposal would direct the city to provide 2,000 units of emergency or permanent housing within a year and require the city to ensure parks, playgrounds and sidewalks remain clear of encampments. King County Superior Court Judge Catherine Shaffer said Friday that it would conflict with state law and usurp the City Council’s power. Shaffer said she and other voters might like what the measure’s proponents are trying to do, but it exceeds what can be accomplished through a local charter amendment. “You can’t amend a city charter to conflict with state law,” Shaffer said. “I like this charter amendment as a voter. But as a judge, it cannot stand.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness and the Transit Riders Union sued to block the measure, officially known as Charter Amendment 29. They argued that it is beyond the scope of local initiative power and violates state law on how local governments can address homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLogan: Guided tours of elk have returned to southern West Virginia. The West Virginia State Parks system announced that viewing tours will be held on weekends starting Sept. 11 and ending Oct. 24. They will start and finish at the Chief Logan State Park lodge in Logan County, the parks system said in a news release. There also will be a few midweek evening tours. Morning tours start at 5:30 a.m.. and evening tours start at 4 p.m. Each tour is limited to 12 people. The tours typically will last four hours, depending on weather and viewing conditions. Groups typically walk or hike up to 3 miles. Tickets cost $30 and can be purchased online. Elk have been transplanted over the past five years at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area in Logan County. They were brought from the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in western Kentucky and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A suburban school district is meeting to possibly reconsider opting out of a federally funded free meal program, a move that met with widespread criticism from parents after school board members said they were concerned participating students would “become spoiled.” The Waukesha school board planned a special meeting Monday to discuss its participation in the program, after parents and other advocates put pressure on the board to reconsider. The Alliance for Education in Waukesha held a rally outside the district office Friday to call for reinstating the program. Administrators opted into the supplemental program last year during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the school board has decided to end it. “As we get back to whatever you want to believe normal means, we have decisions to make,” Joseph Como, president of the school board, said in a meeting. “I would say this is part of normalization.” Board member Karin Rajnicek said the free program made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Waukesha students from low-income families will still be able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A judge is offering defendants a break in their court fines if they agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Natrona County Circuit Court Judge Steven Brown began offering the deal earlier this summer after seeing vaccination rates stagnate. Less than 40% of eligible people in Wyoming are fully vaccinated, putting it among the bottom five states in vaccination rate. The city of Casper has a community service program that works with courts to offer a $10 reduction in fines per hour of work for local charities, nonprofits and other organizations. Getting vaccinated is “just another form of community service,” Brown said Thursday. One woman making an initial appearance in Circuit Court on Monday was offered a $200 reduction in her $560 fine if she was fully vaccinated within 30 days. The fine would be reduced when she returned with proof of receiving the shot. Brown said he doesn’t require vaccination, just incentivizes it, noting other states hold cash drawings, some with million-dollar prizes. The court doesn’t track how many people have accepted the deal. The two other judges in the circuit have not been offering fine reductions for vaccinations.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/19/delawares-dinosaur-wayward-dolphin-duck-justice-news-around-states/50503179/", "title": "Delaware's dinosaur, wayward dolphin, 'Duck of Justice': News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The Poarch Band of Creek Indians said they are issuing a special stipend to all Wind Creek Hospitality employees and moving to flexible schedules as workers deal with rising costs and child-care issues. Wind Creek manages three casino resorts in Alabama, five other casinos around the world, and racetracks in Alabama and Florida. The amount of the stipend was not announced. The tribe said details of the stipend and the flexible schedules will be shared with team members later this month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state plans to begin distributing this year’s oil-wealth fund check and a special energy relief payment to residents on Sept. 20. The timeline was announced Friday by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state Department of Revenue. The combined payout for the dividend and energy relief payment is estimated to be about $3,200 a person; a final figure is pending. Residents will receive the money as one payment, the department said. The energy relief payment was intended by lawmakers as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. Most Alaskans get a dividend. There is a yearly application and residency requirements to qualify. Dividends traditionally have been paid using earnings from the state’s oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund. They are typically paid in the early fall. But Dunleavy said this year’s distribution will be a bit earlier.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered members of the Arizona National Guard to help with flash-flood mitigation efforts across Coconino County. A recent monsoon dropped lots of rain on wildfire burn scars in the Flagstaff area. About 30 members of the Guard helped fill sandbags Saturday, with 60 other members assisting Sunday and 40 more members staying until Friday. Maj. Kyle Key, an Arizona National Guard spokesman, said the goal is to have up to 600,000 sandbags filled by Friday. He said most of the Guard members were already in the Flagstaff area doing annual training.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The U.S. Drought Monitor reported Arkansas is in an abnormally dry stage of drought, with areas surrounding the River Valley in moderate drought. The sudden lack of rain in the past month is also being called a flash drought by meteorologists. Burn bans have been issued in Sebastian County and nearly the entire state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: Containment continued to grow on a wildfire burning for more than a week and residents of the mountain community of Wawona began returning to their homes Sunday, officials said. The fire was 51% contained after scorching 7.6 square miles of forest land, according to an incident update. Residents and property owners can return to Wawona, but only with escorts during specific times, officials said. The area remains under a fire advisory. The blaze began July 7 in Yosemite and is now burning into the Sierra National Forest. How the fire started remains under investigation but officials suspect people were the source.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office has lifted all mandatory evacuations related to a fire burning in Red Feather Lakes.

The sheriff’s office, as well as Red Feather Lakes and Crystal Lakes fire departments, responded.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: A wayward dolphin has been swimming in the Thames River after making its way upstream from Long Island Sound. The dolphin was first spotted Thursday morning by fishermen along the river. A video posted to Facebook showed the dolphin jumping around near the Norwich Marina, about 15 miles from the Sound. Eventually, the animal rescue team at Mystic Aquarium was notified. They have been monitoring the situation along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The ocean mammal was spotted in the same area again on Friday morning. The dolphin appears to be small and might be a juvenile, said Alexandra Cojocaru, the aquarium’s animal rescue technician. It’s possible it was looking for food or got turned around and separated from its pod, she said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The state Senate recently passed a bill to recognize the Dryptosaurus as the state’s official dinosaur. Students at Shue-Medill Middle School drafted House Bill 390 for the Dryptosaurus. State Rep. Paul Baumbach is the primary sponsor of the bill. Some neighboring states already have dinosaurs including Maryland (Astrodon johnstoni) and New Jersey (Hadrosaurus foulkii). “Dryptosauridae bones have been found in the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal,” according to the written synopsis for HB 390. The Dryptosaur was a predator that was about 25 feet long (nose to tip of tail) and probably would have stood 6 to 8 feet tall. It weighed about 1.7 tons. The prehistoric creature was related to the Tyrannosaurus rex. The Dryptosaur roamed Delaware between 65 million and 67 million years ago.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A family from Connecticut is asking for the public’s help in finding a lost stuffed animal at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo, WUSA-TV reported. The family said the stuffed monkey named Mocha belongs to their 3-year-old child, who is heartbroken by the loss. The family is offering a reward for Mocha’s safe return. Anyone who spots the stuffed animal should contact the National Zoo at (202) 633-2614.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: An amusement park where a teenager fell from a ride and died earlier this year has paused a new sniper-like laser shooting game amid criticism following a recent spate of mass shootings. The Bullseye Blast game let riders of the 400-foot Wheel at ICON Park pay an extra $5.95 to shoot laser blasters at 50 targets strategically placed along rooftops throughout the park. In a statement issued Saturday, park officials said although the ride had been “well-received” by customers, some had questioned whether it was appropriate following mass shootings at a July 4 parade in a Chicago suburb, an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas and a grocery store in Buffalo, New York.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: The state will issue electronic debit cards by October for women and children who benefit from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Commonly called the WIC program, it provides food for low-income women during and after pregnancy, as well as children 5 and younger. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported the state is one of the last to quit using paper vouchers after a 2020 mandate from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for states to switch to electronic methods. The state’s electronic pilot program began earlier this month in the district. Mobely said all beneficiaries should have a card by the end of October, giving them greater freedom to manage their spending. Beneficiaries will also be able to check their balances online. Roughly 200,000 women and children in Georgia take advantage of WIC benefits every year, and that number has the potential to increase with a switch to the debit cards.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A hiker who lost visibility because of cloud cover on the Kaau Crater Trail on Sunday afternoon in Palolo was rescued by the Honolulu Fire Department, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur D’Alene: Six of the 31 members of a white supremacist group who were arrested near a northern Idaho pride event last month were scheduled to be in court Monday afternoon, facing misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to riot. The Patriot Front members were arrested June 11 with riot gear after a tipster reported seeing people loading up into a U-Haul at a hotel parking lot in Coeur d’Alene, police said. Scheduled to appear in court Monday were Josiah Buster and his brother Mishael and Connor Moran, all of Watauga, Texas; Derek Smith of Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Dakota Tabler of West Valley City, Utah; and Justin O’Leary, of Des Moines, Washington. Each had posted $300 bail and been released after their arrest.\n\nIllinois\n\nRolling Meadows: A suburban Chicago man has been sentenced to 57 years in prison for shooting an Illinois state trooper in the arm in 2019 as the officer was serving a warrant at his home. Volodymyr Dragan, 46, was sentenced Friday by a Cook County judge after being convicted in March of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and aggravated assault. Prosecutors said Dragan shot a trooper in the arm, causing a nonlife-threatening wound, in August 2019 as officers were serving an arrest and search warrant for Dragan at his home in Wheeling. The warrant included allegations Dragan committed aggravated assault on a police officer during a traffic stop earlier the same day where another state trooper had pulled Dragan’s motorcycle over for speeding. Police said Dragan was seated in the back seat of a trooper’s squad car when he pulled a handgun and aimed it at the trooper before fleeing the scene on his motorcycle. The wounded trooper, who has since returned to full duty, asked the judge to impose the harshest penalty on Dragan.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A $76 million plan to expand the parking garage at Indianapolis International Airport, put on hold at the onset of the pandemic, is now moving forward. The five-story expansion is expected to begin construction this fall and open in early 2024, giving the airport an extra 500 public parking spots and 1,000 rental car spaces. The airport’s existing parking garage, which opened in tandem with the new terminal in 2008, has 5,900 public parking spaces and 1,200 rental spaces. The expanded garage will also have more electric vehicle charging ports. The airport’s board of directors recently approved a $1.3 million contract to build more, with a goal of 2% of spaces having charging capability. By the time the project is complete, that would amount to 172 spaces.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: Safety concerns and supply chain issues have caused the new owners of the Adventureland theme park to close multiple rides this summer. Officials said in a Facebook post Saturday the park’s tallest ride, the Storm Chaser, will be closed for the remainder of the 2022 season. The Sidewinder, Sky Ride and Raging River are also closed. The post didn’t say what issue kept the 260-foot-tall Storm Chaser from operating. The Storm Chaser, which opened in 2014, can reach spinning speeds up to 35 mph. It was manufactured by a company named Mondial in the Netherlands and cost about $3 million.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Several northeast Kansas nonprofit organizations have been chosen to participate in A Community Thrives, an annual fundraising campaign. Helping Hands Humane Society, Topeka Common Ground, the Topeka Genealogical Society, Topeka Performing Arts Center Inc., and Veronica’s Voice, of Kansas City, Kan., are five community organizations that will have the chance to receive a share of $2 million in grants, which will be spread among organizations nationwide.

The agency is looking for people who will invest in youths to help prevent them from returning to custody and to help them become more productive citizens. Open positions include youth workers, nursing, administration, counseling/mental health and food service. The department oversees prevention programs for at-risk youth, confinement, pretrial detention, residential placement and treatment and other services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A bill pending in the state Senate would give control of a state office building in Shreveport to a local government agency, part of a plan to consolidate state workers in a new downtown home. KTBS-TV reported a Senate committee is scheduled to vote this week on House Bill 773, which passed the House earlier. Under the bill, the state would transfer its current office building to the Shreveport Implementation and Redevelopment Authority, with the state getting 30% of any sales price. The state is planning to move workers from the Mary Allen State Office Building, an eight-story art deco structure just south of downtown Shreveport, to a building the state plans to renovate in the city’s downtown. The state bought a long-vacant downtown building, which formerly housed federal workers, for $1.75 million in April. That eight-story building will be gutted and rebuilt with modern offices, providing room for the more than 350 employees now based at Mary Allen, as well as workers from elsewhere in northwest Louisiana. State employees will continue to work in the Mary Allen building for several years until the renovation is complete.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Lt. Tim Cotton, a detective who created the viral “Duck of Justice” when he rescued a faux waterfowl headed for the trash bin, is retiring to write a book. Cotton, 59, combined his sense of humor with the Bangor Police Department’s social media account to show the human side of police work. His “Duck of Justice” became a viral sensation as the fowl appeared in various locations before finding a permanent roost in the police department, where author Stephen King and others have stopped by for photos. Along the way, Cotton helped put the city of 30,000 on the social media map with 330,000 Facebook followers – including many outside Maine. Cotton will continue posting to the Duck of Justice’s Facebook page for the police department while pursuing his writing career. He already has published two books.\n\nMaryland\n\nPiney Point: Crews searched for a 10-year-old girl who disappeared while swimming in southern Maryland on Sunday night, officials said. Two children and an adult were swimming in the Potomac River near Camp Merryelande when the current swept them away, St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Cpl. Julie Yingling said Monday. The adult was able to swim to shore and one child was taken to shore by a person on a paddleboard, she said. A 10-year-old girl was last seen struggling while swimming, officials said.

Crews searched for the girl through the night and continued their search Monday, Yingling said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Connecticut ophthalmologist has pleaded guilty to receiving kickbacks in a scheme in which he ordered hundreds of medically unnecessary brain scans that resulted in millions of dollars in fraudulent billing to health insurers, federal prosecutors said. Dr. Donald Salzberg, 67, conspired with an alleged accomplice at a medical diagnostic company in the scheme that ran from 2014 through 2019, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston said. Salzberg, whose practice is in West Hartford, Connecticut, used false patient diagnoses to order the brain scans and the other person would submit claims to Medicare and other insurance companies for payment, prosecutors said. Salzberg was paid cash kickbacks of $100 to $125 per test that he ordered, as well as sham administrative services fees, while more than $3 million in fraudulent claims were submitted to Medicare and private insurance companies, prosecutors said. Salzberg pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to receive kickbacks. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A sentencing hearing has not yet been scheduled.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Michigan motorists are paying $4.63 a gallon for gasoline on average, a drop of 18 cents from a week ago and 56 cents from a month ago, according to AAA. But, the even bigger news is the auto club predicted prices will continue to decline. Gas demand dropped from 9.41 million barrels of oil a day to 8.06 million, and total domestic gas stocks increased by 5.8 million barrels of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The decrease in demand and declining oil prices helped to push pump prices down.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The third dog that went missing when a Minnesota dog day care was burglarized last week has been found, but no arrests have been made. Railroad workers in St. Paul found Cooper, the miniature pinscher, Saturday morning. The dog had been missing since a burglary was reported Thursday at the St. Paul Paws dog day care. Owner Nicole Campbell said Cooper seems to be OK, but her family will take him to the vet for a checkup to make sure. Police said all the dogs that went missing during the burglary have been accounted for. Fourteen dogs were being boarded at the facility at the time of the burglary. St. Paul police said investigators are reviewing surveillance video from the burglary and chasing several leads to try and identify a suspect.\n\nMississippi\n\nAberdeen: Work has begun to renovate a northeast Mississippi federal courthouse long infested with mold. WTVA-TV reported interior demolition began last week at the Thomas G. Abernethy Federal Building in Aberdeen. The U.S. General Services Administration announced in 2020 it would spend $24.3 million to fix the building’s problems. That came after the GSA ordered the Tennessee Valley Authority to halt a $12 million replacement of the building’s climate control systems when it was found that the project wouldn’t reduce energy use enough to pay for itself over 20 years. Judges and clerks left the building in 2017 when it was found to be uninhabitable. The Aberdeen post office has continued to operate on the bottom floor. Some federal court offices are temporarily located in Amory. Aberdeen Mayor Charles Scott said most changes will be inside the 1973 building because the exterior has historic protection. Officials hope to reopen the federal court in April 2024.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A Missouri man said in a class-action lawsuit against Bass Pro that the outdoor outfitter is refusing to honor its lifetime warranty on its socks. Kent Slaughter of Springfield said after years of exchanging his “Redhead Lifetime Guarantee All-Purpose Wool Socks” every time they wore out the Springfield-based company changed its policy in 2021 before he tried to return four pairs of socks. Instead of getting another pair with a lifetime warranty, Slaughter said he was given socks that only carried a 60-day warranty, according to the Springfield News-Leader. A Bass Pro representative said the company won’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Samuel Grisak, 15, of Great Falls caught a state record golden shiner on July 3 on Giant Springs Pond at Giant Springs State Park. Grisak’s fish weighed .03 pounds and measured 4.41 inches in length with a girth of 2.6 inches and was caught on a dry fly, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

Gilbert is challenging a primary election victory by Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo and was filed with state District Court in Carson City, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Saturday. Lombardo beat Gilbert by 11 percentage points, our about 26,000 votes, in a crowded field. Gilbert already paid for a statewide recount that did not change the outcome. Gilbert – who was outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot – is alleging in his lawsuit that election results were erroneous and that corrections would show he won by a wide margin.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: Investigators were unable to pinpoint the cause of a fire that damaged a popular North Conway resort, New Hampshire Fire Marshal Sean Toomey said. The determination came after officials examined the scene and interviewed guests after the April 30 fire at the Red Jacket Mountain View Resort, Toomey said in a statement. Although the cause of the fire couldn’t be determined, there was no evidence or information that led investigators to believe that a crime had been committed, he said. Three people including two firefighters were injured but none of the injuries was life-threatening.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGreen Creek: A small plane crashed into a field near an airport in southern New Jersey on Saturday, killing the pilot, authorities said.

According to the website for the town of Blowing Rock, public works employees are trying to find the source of the problem, which was reported about 3 a.m. Monday. The town said it’s not known when the water will be restored. The American Red Cross has set up a distribution point for one case of bottled water per family, and the town also said summer camp has been canceled for the day.

Two days after he was accused of firing a gun at a vehicle, he led officers on a chase through Bismarck. Police broke off the pursuit for safety reasons.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A Cleveland police officer claims another officer panicked and “blindly” shot her when they confronted a man standing in a boarding house bathroom with a gun, according to a federal lawsuit. Jennifer Kilnapp’s lawsuit, filed last week, said her rookie partner in July 2020, Bailey Gannon, fled down the stairs after opening the second-floor bathroom door without a warning, where a man stood with a handgun at his side, pointed at the floor. Gannon “blindly” fired a shot from over his head as he retreated and shot Kilnapp, who was standing near the top of the stairs, according to the lawsuit. The bullet “ripped through her forearm before fragmenting in her bicep and chest, lodging near her spine,” according to the lawsuit. “She believed she was going to die.” Two years later, Kilnapp has nerve damage that causes pain in her dominant arm and wrist, the lawsuit said. She has not been able to return to duty because of her injuries and PTSD, and, according to the lawsuit, it’s unknown when she will.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Longtime civil rights landmark the Freedom Center is getting an overhaul as part of efforts to remember and maintain the vision of hose who fought for equality and an end to discrimination in the city. The building, at 2609 N Martin Luther King Ave., was originally a Mobil gas station before being purchased and transformed into the home of the NAACP Youth Council. It was there that school teacher Clara Luper guided efforts to take the 1964 Civil Rights Act from the law of the land and make it a reality.

Completely burned during the 2002 Biscuit Fire, and torched again by the 2017 Chetco Bar and 2018 Klondike fires, endless hours of work went into making the 30-mile pathway that begins south of Grants Pass and ends outside Gold Beach fully passable again.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: Authorities announced an arrest in the stabbing death of a 19-year-old woman in Pennsylvania almost a half-century ago, crediting advances in DNA technology and genetic genealogical research. Lancaster County prosecutors and Manor Township police said Monday a criminal homicide charge had been filed against 68-year-old David Sinopoli in the December 1975 murder of Lindy Sue Beichler. Biechler, a flower shop clerk who had gotten married about a year earlier, was killed in the living room of her suburban Lancaster apartment after she returned from grocery shopping. She was stabbed 19 times; prosecutors said evidence at the scene suggested a sexual motive and investigators believed the killer knew her. Sinopoli was arrested at his Lancaster home Sunday and was being held without bail on a charge of criminal homicide. Court documents don’t list an attorney representing him; a message seeking comment was left at a number listed in his name.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has sued five more landlords who rent properties in which children with lead poisoning live, the state attorney general said. The three properties in Providence, one in Central Falls, and one in Newport all contain “significant lead hazards” and the landlords have failed to comply with state lead poisoning prevention laws, Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. The attorney general has filed 17 lawsuits since last fall against landlords who have failed to fully address alleged lead violations on their properties. The lawsuits seek court orders to remediate lead hazards, provide tenants adequate alternative housing during remediation, and penalties of up to $5,000 a day.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A woman under police suspicion for months has now been charged with the murder of her former boyfriend.

Terms of the settlement have not been released.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Trucking firm LandAir has shut down without notifying the state and leaving an unknown number of employees without jobs. A person in the office of the company confirmed Friday morning it has closed, but declined to be named, saying employees had been told not to talk to the media. Calls to the company number were not answered. Reports of the closure began circulating in trade publications for the trucking industry earlier in the week, saying that employees were “blindsided.” LandAir has not communicated with the state Department of Labor or Agency of Commerce and Community Development concerning any job losses, according to DOL spokesman Kyle Thweatt. Thweatt said there are federal and state requirements for companies with 100 or more employees to give notice well in advance of mass layoffs. The company’s website said it has 450 employees.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: Parts of Gypsy Hill Park remained closed to the public Monday as cleanup efforts continued from last week's devastating storm that impacted the city.

A city official said Monday that initial numbers showed the storm caused more than $750,000 in damage.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A former caregiver charged in connection with the 2019 poisoning death of a developmentally disabled woman has been acquitted of felony assault. Fikirte T. Aseged mistakenly gave cleaning vinegar instead of colonoscopy prep medicine to her 64-year-old client Marion Wilson. Spokane County Superior Court Judge Harold Clarke rendered his verdict through an Ethiopian language interpreter, Northwest News Network reported. The judge said Aseged’s actions met the definition of criminal negligence, but he couldn’t find the vinegar was wielded as a weapon – a requirement for conviction based on a previous Supreme Court finding. Clarke also noted that when Aseged gave Wilson the vinegar, she was 13 hours into a 16-hour double-shift.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A man has been charged with trying to kill his sister, who recently awakened from a two-year coma and identified him as her attacker, authorities said. News outlets reported that Wanda Palmer was found unconscious with serious head injuries at her home in Jackson County on June 10, 2020. Palmer was in a coma in a nursing home for two years. Her brother, Daniel, had been identified as a suspect, but investigators did not have enough evidence to file charges, court documents said. Daniel Palmer, 55, has been charged with attempted murder and malicious wounding, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. Online court records showed Daniel Palmer is being held in jail on $500,000 bail. It was not immediately known Sunday if he had an attorney.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial hopeful Tim Michels’ campaign is reworking a flyer that falsely claimed he won the National Rifle Association’s endorsement, saying the declaration was a mistake. Michels is locked in a three-way GOP primary with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Tim Ramthun. Michels has secured former President Donald Trump’s endorsement and a nod from the NRA would have marked another significant victory for him heading into the Aug. 9 primary. The winner will face Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in the Nov. 8 general election.\n\nWyoming\n\nSinclair: The HF Sinclair oil company said 32 employees at the refinery in Sinclair were laid off this week and 55 others would be laid off as of September, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/29/climate-change-art-year-cat-reunion-spanking-ban-news-around-states/50156353/", "title": "Climate change art, 16-year cat reunion: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Officials have signed a contract to build a new state prison – part of a $1.3 billion construction plan partly using pandemic relief funds – but have not released many of the details. A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed the state signed a contract with Caddell Construction Co., effective April 15, for construction of a specialized men’s prison facility in Elmore County “that will provide enhanced medical and mental health services.” “The new facility will create a safer security environment for inmates and security personnel. Our construction timeline continues to remain on schedule,” Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, wrote in an email. The Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday declined to release a copy of the contract. A spokeswoman said it needed to be redacted, and that would take some time because it is a lengthy contract. The department did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about the cost or the size of the prison. Ivey’s office indicated the prison system should be be able to provide a copy of the “publicly available contract documents in the coming days.” Lawmakers and the governor approved a construction plan that also includes another prison with at least 4,000 beds in Escambia County, a new women’s prison, and renovations to existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Some local officials have raised concerns about militarization of the police force after learning of the police department’s plans to buy an armored security vehicle that can seat 12 officers. Some have referred to the vehicle as a tank and said they worry it could harm a transparent relationship between police and the community. Police counter that the vehicle is a way to help protect officers, especially when dealing with people firing weapons, the Juneau Empire reports. “There’s a policy question here about militarizing our police force, and I don’t agree with that,” City and Borough of Juneau Assembly member Carole Triem said. “I think we’ve heard from the community that they really desire transparency when it comes to operations.” Triem raised the issue late at Monday’s assembly meeting, where she also objected to the police department’s ability to buy the vehicle with a grant that doesn’t require assembly approval. The Lenco Armored Vehicle BearCat G3 will cost more than $300,000 when custom-built to Juneau police department specifications, Lt. Krag Campbell said. Campbell said that despite some in the community describing the vehicle as a “tank,” it’s not a military vehicle. “Generally, it’s for our emergency response teams and our fire department,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Electric companies won’t have to worry about competing for customers after Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill Tuesday that repeals laws allowing for that. His action ends more than 20 years of the state flirting with the idea of customers choosing their power company but never really offering people that choice. Utilities in Arizona supported the legislation because they said allowing competitors to enter the market would threaten the reliability of the power grid as various companies tried to forecast how much power their customers needed. Ducey said competition is a “critically important policy goal” but echoed those concerns about power-grid reliability in his signing letter. “Arizona will not follow the path of California, Texas and other states that have mismanaged their grids and continually experience rolling brownouts and blackouts,” Ducey said in a statement on the bill. Officials at Green Mountain Energy, a company whose move to compete with Arizona utilities appears to have prompted the legislation, said they were disappointed in the governor’s actions. “It is unfortunate that Arizona’s law that would have created competition in the electricity industry, which has been on its books for two decades, has never been implemented,” Green Mountain Vice President Mark Parsons said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is suing Family Dollar over the discovery of more than 1,000 rodents in a distribution facility that prompted the discount retail chain to recall items purchased from hundreds of stores in the South. The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in state court, accuses the chain and parent company Dollar General of deceiving consumers, negligence and engaging in a conspiracy that allowed the infestation at the West Memphis facility to occur. “This misconduct by Family Dollar Stores and Dollar Tree allowed them to maximize profits, while causing Arkansas citizens to purchase hazardous, adulterated and contaminated products,” the lawsuit said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in February that it had inspected the distribution facility following a consumer complaint. Inside the building, inspectors said they found live rodents, dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent feces, dead birds and bird droppings. A Dollar Tree spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. According to the lawsuit, state and federal inspections show Family Dollar had known of the rodent infestation at its facility since at least January 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: People who get hurt because of a doctor’s negligence could soon get a lot more money in malpractice lawsuits under an agreement reached Wednesday that – if approved by the Legislature – would avoid a costly fight at the ballot box this November while resolving one of the state’s longest-running political battles. California does not limit how much money patients can win in malpractice cases for economic damages, which include things that can be counted such as medical expenses and lost wages. But since 1975, state law has limited how much money patients can win for what can’t be counted – such as pain and suffering – to $250,000. Trial attorneys and patients’ rights groups have tried and failed for decades to raise that limit, noting it sometimes costs more than that to take one of these complex lawsuits to trial. Doctors have usually opposed raising the limits, saying it would result in soaring malpractice insurance premiums that could put some community health clinics out of business. With neither side budging, California voters were set to settle the issue in November. But supporters of raising the limit agreed to withdraw the measure from the November ballot Wednesday, instead supporting a new bill in the Legislature that would gradually increase the limit over the next 10 years. The bill has the support of the California Medical Association, the Consumer Attorneys of California, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, state legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nColorado\n\nCanon City: An outbreak of an undetermined and highly contagious disease has killed dozens of wild horses at a federal holding facility in southern Colorado. Bureau of Land Management officials say 67 horses have died since the outbreak began Saturday at the agency’s holding pen in Canon City, about 150 miles southwest of Denver. “We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible,” said Stephen Leonard, the manager of the BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program. The facility, which is under voluntary quarantine, currently holds 2,550 horses. BLM officials say the horses that have been most affected by the disease were gathered from the West Douglas area last fall. No other information has been released.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Broad agreement has been reached on a revised one-year state budget proposal, Gov. Ned Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly announced Wednesday. The $24.2 billion plan, set to take effect July 1 in the midst of the election season, would see nearly $500 million in tax reductions including the continuation of the 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax cut until Dec. 1, lawmakers said. It also includes substantial new spending for mental health programs for children and early childhood programs, which have struggled to pay workers competitive wages while ensuring services are affordable to families. And the proposal makes $2 billion in payments to help reduce state pension debt, according to the legislators, who have yet to release any documents. Lamont and the Democrats haven’t settled how much of the state’s share of federal COVID-19 funds will be spent in this budget, including how much of that money will be set aside for pandemic pay for essential workers and to reduce the $493 million debt in the state’s unemployment trust fund. But they expressed confidence the budget will be approved before the legislative session ends May 4. Democrats said they were hopeful that at least some Republicans, the minority in the Assembly, will support the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nBear: Sixteen years ago after Jason McKenry’s 2-year-old gray tabby escaped from his apartment, he got a text: Ritz had been taken to a veterinarian and was about to be put down when someone found a microchip. Little is known of the cat’s whereabouts after that day in Bear, though McKenry did learn that Ritz had hitched a ride in a neighbor’s pickup truck after charging out of the apartment. For the past couple of years, Ritz has been surviving thanks to the kindness of strangers near Lums Pond. One of those strangers took the cat to the vet and started the chain of events that led to McKenry and Ritz being reunited. But everything in between is a mystery. “I wish he could talk,” McKenry said this week. “I’d love to hear his story.” Everyone connected to the cat, from those who were feeding him to the makers of the microchip, is stunned by the story. “Sixteen years? That’s a new record as far as I know,” said Tom Sharp, president of AKC Reunite, a national database for microchipped pets. “That’s amazing.” Sharp said he expects shelters and veterinarians to check for microchips on animals when they are taken in or before they are adopted out. These microchips, known as radio frequency identification, are not able to locate or trace a pet’s whereabouts because they don’t have GPS.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents in the Southeast neighborhood are being warned after a turkey was seen disrupting bike riders and hikers on a nearby trail, WUSA-TV reports. Late last week, the Department of Energy and Environment, National Park Service, Humane Rescue Alliance and Maryland Department of National Resources were first alerted to an aggressive turkey attacking residents on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail. Wildlife officials said they had received multiple reports of turkeys attacking people in the district. According to DOEE, it’s turkey breeding season, and the rise in attacks is related to territorial behavior. One of the latest encounters was caught on video by local go-go musician DeDe Folarin of Rare Essence, who was riding his bike on the trail April 12. “All of a sudden, I was coming around the bend, and this big wild turkey just jumps up and almost claws me in the face,” he said. Folarin said he dismounted his bike while the turkey continued to harass him for nearly five minutes. The large bird then turned its attention to another passing cyclist as Folarian captured video of the encounter. “After the lady asked if I could help, I picked up a stick, and I kind of whacked the turkey, and he kind of ran back into the brush, and that was it,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A judge on Wednesday vacated the life sentence of a 55-year-old Black man who prosecutors said was wrongfully convicted because of mistaken identity in 1991. “I feel good. Real good,” Thomas “Jay” Raynard James said Wednesday as he left a Miami courtroom with his attorneys and family members. James was convicted of the 1990 death of Francis McKinnon, largely on identification by an eyewitness who told jurors she watched him gun down her stepfather during a robbery in his Coconut Grove apartment. Earlier Wednesday, James, wearing his red prison uniform and shackles, stood behind his mother, Doris Strong, as Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle detailed a 90-page motion her office filed asking for the conviction to be vacated. “Mom, hopefully the court will grant you the freedom you’ve been looking for for so many years,” Fernandez Rundle told Strong, who sobbed quietly throughout the news conference. James was 23 when he was convicted. Over the past year, Fernandez Rundle said, members of her office’s Justice Project poured over 20,000 pages of documents, reinterviewed witnesses, resubmitted fingerprints and retested DNA samples. In a 90-page motion to vacate the conviction, prosecutors said that “what appears to be a chance coincidence that the defendant, Thomas Raynard James, had the same name as a suspect named by witnesses and anonymous tipsters … led to the defendant’s photograph being included in a lineup, and set in motion a mistaken identity.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morris Brown College has regained full accreditation after a 20-year journey that its leaders hope will ultimately prompt higher enrollment. The Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools voted Tuesday to grant the liberal arts college full accreditation status, meaning its students can apply for federal loans and Pell grants, the association confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked Morris Brown’s accreditation in 2002 after a former college president and financial aid director were found to be misappropriating federal funds and rising debt. “Morris Brown College just made history,” President Kevin James told the newspaper. “We’re excited about it. A lot of people had written us off. But due to a lot of hard work and dedication, we were able to regain our accreditation.” Morris Brown sought accreditation from TRACS, which also approved reaccreditation to another HBCU in Georgia: Paine College in Augusta. James, Morris Brown’s leader since 2019, called the process “the hard reset.” The historically Black college planned to formally announce the reaccreditation Thursday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s top public health officials said Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic is still active but is moving into a new phase of the disease, in which people can test themselves at home and ideally avoid serious illness thanks to vaccination and the use of therapeutic treatments. Gov. David Ige described the change as a transition from “emergency response” to “public health management.” He said at a news conference that state officials would be handling COVID-19 more similarly to other diseases. The adjustment has been underway for a few months, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health. One example is how the state uses contact tracers. “We’ve seen a shift from trying to track down every single case and all of their contacts to instead getting the message out so that we all have our own personal COVID-19 preparedness plan,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the state’s epidemiologist. Part of that change is possible because home test kits are now widely available. But another reason is that universal contact tracing isn’t the best method to control an airborne disease like COVID-19, she said. People can follow self-isolation guidelines and notify those with whom they’ve been in contact about their exposure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Jurors have begun deliberating in the rape trial of a former state lawmaker accused of sexually assaulting a legislative intern last year. Prosecutors and the defense attorney for Aaron von Ehlinger made their final arguments to the jury late Thursday morning, moments after von Ehlinger gave his own recounting of the events. Von Ehlinger, 39, has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object – both charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison – and maintains he had consensual sex with the 19-year-old intern. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted and has referred to the woman in this case as “Jane Doe” at her request. Doe told her supervisors that von Ehlinger, then a Republican representative from Lewiston, raped her in March 2021 at his Boise apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. Von Ehlinger resigned from the House of Representatives last year after a legislative ethics committee recommended he be banned from the Statehouse because of his conduct with Doe. Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told jurors the case was about “power in the wrong hands” used to the “great devastation” of Doe. Von Ehlinger had social, political and physical power over the petite intern, Farley said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed four pieces of legislation into law Wednesday aimed at easing a shortage of teachers and classroom aides in public schools. The new laws lower the fee to reinstate a lapsed teaching certificate, allow student teaching by college seniors, lower the minimum age for classroom aides, and extend the number of days in a row a short-term substitute can spend in one classroom if a disaster is declared. Pritzker signed the bills during a ceremony at Springfield High School, just two blocks from the Capitol. The Illinois State Board of Education estimates there will be about 4,120 openings in public schools this fall. That includes 1,700 teachers and 1,240 paraprofessionals, who are qualified but unlicensed educators who help teachers. It’s not a new situation and predates the COVID-19 pandemic. But the coronavirus, which forced schools into a roller coaster of openings and closings, scheduling and staffing, worsened matters. Several lawmakers have been focused on getting classrooms staffed with qualified people. Rep. Sue Scherer, a Decatur Democrat and former teacher, said a retired teacher who is a constituent wanted to help out because of the crisis before learning it would cost him $500 to reinstate his license. Scherer’s legislation, run through the Senate by Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, lowers that fee to $50 immediately.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafeyette: Purdue University and Duke Energy plan to jointly explore the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the campus’s long-term energy needs and reduce its carbon footprint, they announced Wednesday. Purdue and Duke intend to study power produced through small modular reactors, which are significantly smaller than traditional nuclear power plants. An SMR could meet current and future needs for the West Lafayette campus and provide excess power to the state’s electric grid. SMRs can be prefabricated off site, saving money and time in construction. “No other option holds as much potential to provide reliable, adequate electric power with zero carbon emissions,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. However, nuclear power plants use large amounts of water for steam production and cooling. They also produce spent uranium fuel, which is stored in pools or steel-lined concrete vaults for decades. Purdue provided no time line on when its first SMR might arrive on campus. Duke said it is the largest regulated nuclear plant operator in the nation, with 11 nuclear units at six plant sites in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Bureau of Refugee Services says it is seeking families to become official sponsors of Ukrainian refugees who may be coming to Iowa under a new federal program. In a news release, the bureau said it plans to assist families with webinars and training sessions to help sponsors understand what resettlement entails, what their duties and responsibilities will be, and the resources available to help them. The news release did not say how many Ukrainians are likely to come to Iowa or what plans are being made to deal with those Ukrainians after Afghan refugees who began arriving in the Des Moines metro late last year told reporters they’ve struggled without sufficient long-term housing, food and other assistance. While the bureau said it stands ready to help prospective sponsors, they also can apply directly through the federal program at welcome.us. But Des Moines Refugee Support, a nonprofit that has been working closely with Afghan refugees, said in a statement Wednesday that volunteers would love to welcome Ukrainians, but Des Moines is not ready to take them. “We are worried about the logistics, as we have many Afghan families still in hotels, Afghans still needing food assistance, Afghan babies without diapers,” the statement said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw a 4.1% increase in the number of abortions performed in 2021 compared with 2020, with more Missouri residents but fewer Oklahoma and Texas residents coming into Kansas to terminate pregnancies. A preliminary report Tuesday from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showed that 7,849 abortions were performed in the state last year. That’s 303 more than the 7,546 performed in Kansas in 2020. The state saw an increase of more than 9% in the number of abortions performed in 2020 over 2019, due to an influx of patients from Oklahoma and Texas, where Republican governors shut down providers early in the coronavirus pandemic, while Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, kept them open. But the number of abortions performed in Kansas for women from Oklahoma and Texas dropped to a total of 370 in 2021 from 566 in 2020, a decline of nearly 35%. Meanwhile, the number of abortions for women from Missouri was 3,458 last year, up 8% or 257 from 2020. And 8% more Kansas residents had abortions in the state in 2021 than in 2020. The increase was 292, making the total 3,937.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A long-controversial proposal for a pipeline that would snake through Bullitt County and a beloved arboretum is being sent back to the drawing board after a vital permit for the project was suspended. After several conservation groups threatened to sue to prevent Louisville Gas & Electric from building the natural gas pipeline, which would cut through some property owned by Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to review how the project could affect three bat species protected by the Endangered Species Act that live in the region. Construction on the 12-mile pipeline has not yet started and, under the new ruling, will not be able to begin until the two agencies ensure the species – Indiana bats, gray bats and northern long-eared bats – are not put at risk. The contested project has been in the works for years, sparking outcry from environmental advocates and others in the community since it was first proposed in 2015. “Save Bernheim Forest” yard signs are a common sight around Louisville among homeowners concerned about the proposed pipeline’s potential impact on the popular 16,000-acre wildlife sanctuary just south of the city.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A bill to outlaw spanking and all other forms of corporal punishment in the state’s public schools cleared its first hurdle Wednesday as lawmakers determine whether hitting children in schools is an appropriate form of discipline or abuse. The Louisiana House Education Committee advanced Metairie Republican Rep. Stephanie Hilferty’s House Bill 649 without objection. “We don’t allow juveniles in our detention centers or (inmates) in our prisons to be hit; I’m asking for the same treatment for our children while they’re in school,” Hilferty said while testifying for her bill. An identical bill in 2021 by Hilferty made it to the House floor, where it was defeated on a 48-49 vote. Louisiana is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in public schools. Among the others are neighbors Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas. Fellow Metairie Republican Rep. Laurie Schlegel made the motion to approve Hilferty’s legislation. “I was shocked that this is still a thing,” Schlegel said. Louisiana Partnership for Children and Families executive director Susan East Nelson, who has previously described corporal punishment as “state-sponsored child abuse,” testified again in favor of banning the practice. “This has been a priority for us for 10 years,” Nelson said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A hunting group is suing the state to overturn its long-standing ban on Sunday hunting. Hunting bear, moose, wild turkey and deer is popular in Maine, but the state has barred Sunday hunting for generations. Opponents of the ban filed their lawsuit Wednesday with a claim that the law violates the state’s new “Right to Food” amendment. Maine voters passed the nation’s first such constitutional amendment last year. The amendment states that individuals have a right to harvest food of their own choosing. The opponents of the Sunday hunting ban said in a statement that Maine’s long-standing ban “was created based on the religious and social beliefs at the time, not biology or science.” But the ban has withstood challenges in the past. The Legislature’s Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife voted against a proposal to end the ban in March. The Maine Professional Guides Association, which represents guides who assist hunters, was among the groups that opposed the change. The only other state that bans Sunday hunting is Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints U.S. currency, is moving forward with plans to build its new facility in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The bureau is expecting to house at least 850 workers on site, with 600 additional employees working remotely, the governor’s office said. The 104-acre site, located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Prince George’s County, has been officially transferred to the Department of the Treasury. It will house a new state-of-the-art and environmentally conscious production facility to print U.S. paper currency and other federal security products. “Over the past three years, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the state of Maryland have worked closely on evaluating the potential for this Beltsville facility and determining how we can best work together to make this project successful,” Hogan said in a statement. The bureau is in the design stage of the project and plans to wrap up design development by summer 2023. Construction of the new facility, which is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore District, is anticipated to be completed by early 2027, with currency production starting midyear.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former transit police officer has pleaded guilty to assaulting and violating the civil rights of a 63-year-old man who refused to get off a bus last year but has avoided jail and could eventually have the charges dismissed. Prosecutors on Wednesday asked a Superior Court judge to sentence Nicholas Morrissey to a one-year suspended sentence with three years of probation, according to a statement Thursday from the Suffolk district attorney’s office. The judge, citing Morrissey’s military service and the fact he resigned, continued the case for an 18-month probationary period. That means charges could be dismissed if Morrissey complies with the terms of probation. He is also not allowed to seek another job in law enforcement. “The actions of one officer can sow seeds of distrust in our entire system,” Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Transit Police Department for their immediate actions to hold a member of their own ranks accountable and to ensure the wellbeing of the public they serve.” Morrissey’s attorney said his client is a Marine Corps veteran who had no prior disciplinary problems. “I think it was a fair disposition,” Robert Jubinville said. “This fellow had been on the job for 13 years and had never had any issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man in prison for 15 years for kidnapping and sexual assault was cleared of the crimes Wednesday after authorities discovered many mistakes, including a failure to disclose DNA results proving his innocence. “There were so many things missed along the way,” said Valerie Newman of the Wayne County prosecutor’s office, who reviews Detroit-area cases that can turn out to be wrongful convictions. Judge Kelly Ramsey approved a request to erase Terance Calhoun’s convictions in two cases from 2006 and immediately release him from prison. His earliest parole date would have been November 2023. Calhoun, 35, declined to speak during the court hearing, which was held by video conference, but wore a big smile when lawyers Tabitha Harris and Michael Mittlestat congratulated him. “Good luck to you,” the judge said. In 2007, Calhoun pleaded no contest to kidnapping and other charges and was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. He was accused of targeting two teen girls in Detroit in 2006. But a few months after Calhoun was sent to prison, tests revealed a condom linked to an assault on the second victim had ruled him out as the perpetrator. There is no indication the DNA results were given to his lawyer, Newman said. She also noted that a description of the attacker as a man with braids and a puzzle tattoo didn’t fit Calhoun.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Legislative leaders announced a deal Thursday to refill the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund and to pay bonuses to front-line workers, resolving a months­long impasse. The tentative agreement includes $2.7 billion to replenish the trust fund and pay back a debt to the federal government for jobless aid, as well as $500 million in bonuses for workers who took risks during the pandemic. House Democrats came down from their $1 billion proposal for bonus checks, cutting the amount per worker in half to $750 but keeping eligibility at about 667,000 workers. The proposal – which would spend all of Minnesota’s remaining federal pandemic relief funds of more than $1 billion – also includes $190 million for a pandemic response account to support efforts that are already ongoing, like the state’s testing apparatus. A House provision making hourly school employees eligible for unemployment insurance during the summer months was cut in the compromise. “We tried to get it done earlier,” said Senate Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, citing the Senate passage of its unemployment insurance bill in February on a bipartisan 55-11 vote. “It took a little bit longer than we’d hoped, but the final deal is a good deal for the people of Minnesota, and we’re happy to get it done.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves has vetoed part of a budget bill for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, saying he objects to spending $50 million for improvements to the adult hospital in Jackson. The Republican governor issued the partial veto of Senate Bill 3010 on Tuesday. Legislators specified the $50 million would come from Mississippi’s pandemic recovery money from the federal government. UMMC declined to comment on the partial veto, spokesperson Marc Rolph said Wednesday. Reeves wrote on Twitter that UMMC’s academic functions – teaching physicians, nurses and other health care professionals – are largely funded by the state, but the hospital is not. “They are responsible for their own operational budget – just like other hospitals,” Reeves wrote. The governor wrote that UMMC receives “competitive advantages” over other hospitals and physician groups because it does not need the Health Department’s approval for new facilities or large equipment. However, UMMC does need approval from the state college board. “There is little reason that Mississippi taxpayers should radically increase the commitment to further subsidize the operations of UMMC to the detriment of competitors,” Reeves wrote. “Furthermore, they currently have enough money to willingly turn away patients on private insurance, clearly indicating that they have no need for the state to underwrite their ambitious building/spending goals.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A divided state Senate narrowly passed legislation Thursday that could allow thousands of elderly, disabled and homeless residents to spend government food stamp benefits at restaurants – something currently allowed in only a handful of states. The bill revealed deep divisions within the Republican-led chamber, where most GOP members voted against what they described as an “expansion of the welfare state” even as Republican leaders joined with Democrats to support it. The measure passed 18-15, receiving the bare minimum to advance to the House with just two weeks remaining in the legislative session. Low-income residents receiving aid from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program generally must get food at retail locations, such as grocery and convenience stores. But the federal government allows states to enact policies authorizing elderly, disabled and homeless residents to buy food at restaurants that agree to sell meals at lower prices. Some in the conservative caucus claimed their party leaders were violating a core GOP campaign pledge by supporting the legislation and encouraging low-income residents to squander their benefits. Others pushed back, noting the bill doesn’t increase the overall cost of the program but rather offers options for hot meals for people in need. Those who are disabled or elderly might not be able to cook, and people who are homeless don’t have refrigerators to store food or kitchens to prepare it, said Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, the Republican whip responsible for rallying votes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new law that requires the state’s attorney general to warn voters if a proposed ballot initiative would hurt businesses does not apply to ballot measures that would amend the state constitution, a state judge has ruled. Wednesday’s decision by District Court Judge Chris Abbott of Helena allows signature gathering to continue for a constitutional initiative that seeks to cap residential property taxes at 1% of the assessed value and limit annual changes in valuations, thus limiting changes in residential property taxes. Market value assessments would be performed when property is sold or significantly improved, under the proposed initiative. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana Farmers Union, Realtor Jeff Barber, farmer Ron Ostberg and rancher Dennis McDonald argued in a complaint filed in January that Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and Attorney General Austin Knudsen did not meet the requirements of the new law before allowing signatures to be gathered to put Constitutional Initiative 121 on the November 2022 ballot. The state argued and Abbott agreed that the law passed in 2021 applies only to initiatives that seek to change the law, not to change the state constitution. The plaintiffs oppose the ballot initiative because putting a limit on residential property taxes could shift the tax burden to agricultural land and other property and lead to reductions in state services.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Another large case of bird flu at a farm has been confirmed, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday. The highly contagious avian influenza was found on a farm in Knox County in northeast Nebraska along the South Dakota border. It is the seventh confirmed case of the disease in the state this year, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture said in a news release. More than 2.1 million laying hens will be euthanized, agriculture officials said. The farm will also be quarantined, and a 6.2-mile control zone will be established. The department also announced that an order prohibiting any type of birds from events such as fairs, expositions, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird auctions has been extended to May 15. It was scheduled to expire Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A wild coyote howls at the glow of a lamp post in a snowy parking lot. A mustard-yellow recliner is beached in a flooded grove of trees. These images depicting interactions between the human and natural world are part of the Nevada Museum of Art’s Altered Landscape collection and the inspiration behind a new classical composition, “Altered Landscape,” which the Reno Philharmonic will perform May 7-8 at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. In the upcoming performance, the Reno Phil plans to present a composition that will tackle the complexity of climate change and how the pandemic reflected that complexity. “This is a project that sheds both light and hope on one of the most urgent issues of our time: climate change,” said Reno Phil Music Director Laura Jackson. “There is no question that we are in an era where human impact has reached every corner of the earth, and we can no longer take for granted the health and abundance of the natural resources we hold dear.” In 2019, Jackson commissioned Peruvian-born composer Jimmy López Bellido to create a piece of music that would tell a story about climate change. The Reno Phil is approaching orchestras worldwide to perform the symphony in their respective communities. Rather than paying a consortium fee to the Reno group, other orchestras will donate a minimum of $1,000 directly to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has blocked an attempt to eliminate a registration system put in place years ago to prevent widespread hepatitis C outbreaks. New Hampshire created the Board of Registration for Medical Technicians in response to David Kwiatkowski, who is serving 39 years in prison for replacing painkillers with saline-filled syringes tainted with his blood. Despite being fired numerous times over drug allegations, Kwiatkowski had worked in 18 hospitals in seven states before being hired in at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. After his arrest in 2012, 46 people in four states were diagnosed with the same strain of the hepatitis C virus he carries, including one who died in Kansas. The New Hampshire House recently passed a bill that would eliminate the board, with supporters saying it creates unnecessary bureaucracy at a time when health care facilities are struggling to hire workers. But the Senate killed it Thursday, citing the importance of patient safety.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Orsted, the Danish wind power developer, signed an agreement Thursday with New Jersey officials to use a state-financed manufacturing port to build the components of the state’s first offshore wind farm. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the agreement during an international wind energy conference in Atlantic City, from whose coast the project’s turbines should be visible on the distant horizon. Orsted, which is partnering with Newark-based PSEG to build the project, will lease the New Jersey Wind Port in Salem County for two years starting in April 2024. Murphy did not reveal how much the developers will pay for the lease. The parties signed the letter of intent Thursday, but binding agreements are to be submitted to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by June. The pact marks the first return on the state’s investment of up to $500 million in the wind port, designed to help the state attract companies interested in building wind power projects as New Jersey seeks to become the East Coast hub of the offshore wind industry. “This is a huge moment: Today is a vision turning into reality,” Murphy said at the conference, sponsored by the Business Network for Offshore Wind. “This is truly New Jersey’s ‘if you build it, they will come’ moment.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s K-12 schools should cut staff and think about downsizing the district’s footprint amid dwindling enrollment while spending more for the education of low-income students who fell further behind their peers during this school year, according to a report from the Legislature made public Wednesday. The report from the powerful Legislative Finance Committee recommended Albuquerque Public Schools let go of 400 of the district’s 12,000 employees but didn’t specify how many of the district’s increasingly empty schools it should shutter. The system has 144 schools and 73,000 students, down from 85,000 six years ago. Public schools in New Mexico have not recovered from the exodus of students that accelerated during the pandemic, with enrollment across the state and in Albuquerque still down about 4%, more than the average of 2.6% for 41 U.S. states. Thousands of families in New Mexico amid the pandemic tried home-schooling or charter schools for the first time and didn’t send their kids back to traditional classrooms this year. Despite getting financing federal pandemic relief funds, most school districts across the U.S. now have fewer students and less funding than before the pandemic, forcing educators to consider cutting spending.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s highest court on Wednesday rejected new congressional maps that had widely been seen as favoring Democrats, largely agreeing with Republican voters who argued the district boundaries were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The decision may delay New York’s primary elections by as much as two months and is likely a hammer-blow to Democrats’ national redistricting hopes, which leaned heavily on their ability to gerrymander New York state to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. The state’s Court of Appeals said the Democratic-led Legislature lacked the authority to redraw congressional and state Senate maps after an independent redistricting commission charged with crafting new maps failed to reach a consensus. The judges also said lawmakers gerrymandered the congressional maps to Democrats’ favor, in violation of a 2014 constitutional amendment designed to rout out political gamesmanship in redistricting. The Appeals Court handed authority to draw new district maps to an expert, known as a special court master, instead of the Legislature. “Prompt judicial intervention is both necessary and appropriate to guarantee the People’s right to a free and fair election,” said the court’s opinion, written by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State residents can now cast ballots in person for the May 17 primary elections. Election boards in all 100 counties opened early voting sites Thursday morning. People who are registered to vote or who apply at a site can cast ballots. Party nominations for the U.S. Senate and House, the Legislature, judicial positions and county offices are at stake. There are also municipal races – many of them officially nonpartisan – in towns and cities where 2021 elections were delayed. The early-voting period continues through the afternoon of May 14. Some counties will have early voting on preceding weekends. An unaffiliated voter can choose to cast ballots in the Democratic or Republican primary but not both. Registered Democrats and Republicans must vote in their party’s primary. People who are already registered have other voting options. They can request a mail-in absentee ballot by May 10, or they can vote in person May 17.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The planned Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in western North Dakota won’t get all the money initially promised from a Walmart heir, but officials say they surpassed its $100 million private fundraising goal anyway. Rob and Melani Walton had pledged $50 million to the project near Medora but wound up committing to $15 million instead, as first reported by KFGO radio. Melani Walton, a Williston native, had been a member of the library’s board but resigned last month. Rob Walton is the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Both library officials and the Waltons downplayed the diminished donation. “When the history of this remarkable institution is told years from now, Melani and Rob will occupy a significant place in that story,” library foundation CEO Ed O’Keefe told The Bismarck Tribune. “We wish them nothing but the best.” A statement from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation said the couple “is so pleased to have supported this project from its inception.” Library organizers set the fundraising bar at $100 million in order to access an additional $50 million in state money. O’Keefe declined to say how much money has been raised, citing “the quiet phase of the capital campaign,” but said that “I can assure you it is in excess of $100 million.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Frustrated Democrats took the unusual step Thursday of calling their own political mapmaking hearing of sorts, inviting public testimonials and streaming the proceeding on Facebook. State Sen. Vernon Sykes and House Democratic Leader Allison Russo are both members of the bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission, a seven-member panel controlled by Republicans. The commission has not yet reconvened despite facing a May 6 deadline set by the Ohio Supreme Court for fixing its fourth set of invalidated Statehouse maps – though it has set a meeting for May 4, the day after the primary election. Sykes and Russo said their decision to schedule the forum followed their repeated attempts to get the other commissioners to the table, or to convene the panel themselves. Neither strategy worked, they said. The GOP’s casual approach to the deadline follows a key decision last week by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which indicated in a separate federal lawsuit that it plans to impose the commission’s third set of legislative maps May 28 if no alternative is passed by then. The state Supreme Court has ruled the third set of maps – like the first, second and fourth – an unconstitutional gerrymander unduly favoring Republicans. “Too bad so sad,” influential Republican state Rep. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, said in a Twitter spat with former Ohio Democratic Chair David Pepper over the ruling. “We win again.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House gave final approval Thursday to a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The bill approved by the GOP-led House on a 68-12 vote without discussion or debate now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it within days. House members also voted Thursday to adopt new language prohibiting transgender students from using school restrooms that match their current gender identity and requiring parental notification to parents ahead of any classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity. “They’re all concerned about their elections coming up and making sure they have something they can put on a postcard to talk about,” said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Midwest City. The abortion bill, dubbed the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act, prohibits abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in the fetus, which experts say is roughly six weeks into a pregnancy. A similar bill approved in Texas last year led to a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state, sending many women seeking the procedure to Oklahoma and other surrounding states. Although Stitt already signed a bill this year to make performing an abortion a felony crime, it’s not set to take effect until later in the summer and might not withstand a legal challenge.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a $1.1 billion verdict against the state over its forest management practices, the latest development in a decades­long dispute over the best use of vast tracts of forestland that cover much of the state’s rural areas. A Linn County jury found in 2019 that Oregon breached its contract with 13 rural counties and 151 local taxing districts by failing to maximize timber harvests on state forests over the past two decades. The counties have said Oregon must manage more than 700,000 acres of state forestland for maximum timber revenue, while the state Department of Forestry believes it has the discretion to manage the land for wildlife and recreation. Gov. Kate Brown applauded the reversal and said in a statement that Oregon manages its forests sustainably “not only for the benefit and prosperity of this generation but those to come.” “Today’s decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals is a validation of the fact that a balanced, science-based approach to public forest management will produce the greatest long-term outcomes for all Oregonians, including the counties and taxing districts that receive revenue from state forests,” she said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHonesdale: A candidate in next month’s Republican primary for lieutenant governor was ordered this week to stay away from his home after his wife made claims of physical and mental abuse in obtaining a protective order. Teddy Daniels was accused of making threats, saying he would kill the family dog and grabbing his wife by the shirt. The woman also told a judge Daniels stalked her at work, “screaming at me, making me cry,” and continually cursed at her and threatened to throw her out of the home if he loses his campaign. He has hurled verbal abuse toward their son, she said in a handwritten, three-page petition. He also prevents her from seeing her family and told her she couldn’t attend a family funeral, she wrote. Daniels, 47, is one of nine candidates seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s May 17 primary, running with the endorsement of a leading candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano. Both are vocal supporters of ex-President Donald Trump. Daniels has said he, like Mastriano, was outside the U.S. Capitol during the insurrectionist riot Jan. 6, 2021. Responding to his wife’s accusations, Daniels vowed to stay in the race and claimed without evidence that he was the target of “political terrorism” meant to damage his campaign. A Wayne County judge granted a temporary protection from abuse order to Daniels’ wife Tuesday. Daniels was removed from his home in a gated community in the Poconos. The judge gave Daniels’ wife temporary custody of their child and ordered Daniels to turn over his guns.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday pulled out of a planned gubernatorial debate next week as a new online poll showed his popularity has fallen dramatically since last year. McKee was slated to participate in the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council candidate forum May 5 but said Thursday that he won’t do any debates until the election ballot is set at the end of June. “I’ll engage in these debates and forums once everybody signs their name on the line that they are running, and I am going to have to do that as well,” McKee told reporters at a general news briefing Thursday without elaborating on the decision. McKee skipped the first gubernatorial debate in February hosted by the Rhode Island Democratic Women’s Caucus. McKee’s office told RIPEC he is not doing debates last week after twice confirming he would attend, the business-backed fiscal watchdog group said Thursday. The announcement that McKee will not debate his rivals until the summer coincided with the release of an online poll from Morning Consult that found 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing, and 40% disapprove. It’s a big drop in popularity from last year, when Morning Consult found 59% of voters surveyed from July to October approved of the job McKee was doing, and only 25% disapproved.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People who want the state to become the 49th to pass a hate crimes law have explained, bargained and begged Republicans in the state Senate just to hold a debate on the bill. On Wednesday, with just days left before the measure dies, they turned to one of the survivors of one of the most heinous racist attacks in modern America seeking to persuade senators to at least take a vote on the bill. They showed a two-minute video of Polly Sheppard to the Senate chamber, where the bill has been stuck for months, with eight Republicans senators objecting and only eight more legislative days to take action. The racist gunman who killed nine of Sheppard’s church friends in 2015 pointed his gun at the woman but said he would spare her life so she could let the world know he was killing Black people because he hated them. One of the dead from the attack was Sheppard’s pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, whose portrait hangs in a place of honor in the Senate chamber. “Eight members of the South Carolina Senate are giving a safe haven to hate. Every time you look at senator Pinckney’s photograph, you should be reminded that hate killed him,” Sheppard said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: In the wake of a high school teacher handing out a letter that refuted the gender identities of transgender students, some local organizations and businesses are working to provide a safe, supportive community for LGBTQ+ kids. Watertown Love held an event Tuesday night during which students, friends and family could converse in a safe environment. The gathering also provided an opportunity for community members to show their support for those affected by Monday’s incident at Watertown High School, which the school district is investigating. Students received a letter from German teacher Calvin Hillesland saying that when they asked him to call their friends by masculine names, he felt it was “wrong” and “a lie.” First Congregational United Church of Christ in Watertown was one of the community entities that offered support. Pastor Dustin Bartlett provided a letter of his own to the students and all LGBTQ+ individuals who might be struggling with their understanding of God and how religion fits with their sexuality and gender. “I have read the Bible. I have read much of it, including the so-called ‘clobber passages’ that have been used to attack LGBTQ+ people, in the original Hebrew and Greek languages,” he wrote. “I am something of an expert on this question, certainly more so than that of a high school German teacher. And I want to set the record straight. ... You are loved and worthy of love, just as you are. God loves you, just as you are.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republicans advanced legislation Wednesday that would place more scrutiny over what books are placed in public schools’ libraries, moments after the bill’s sponsor in the state House said any inappropriate book should be burned. The measure is just one of several proposals introduced in Tennessee this year designed to impose more scrutiny and transparency in school libraries amid a national spike in book challenges and bans. School librarians have become the target of scorn from GOP lawmakers pushing for more oversight on materials provided to children, particularly those that touch on racism and LGBTQ issues. Rep. Jerry Sexton, R-Bean Station, introduced a last-minute amendment this week to a school bill that would give the state’s textbook commission – made up of politically appointed members – veto power over what books end up on school library shelves. Schools would have to provide the commission a list of their library materials. Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with books deemed to be inappropriate. “You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?” Clemmons asked. “I don’t have a clue, but I would burn them,” Sexton said on the House floor. Later, he amended what he had said on the floor to note that he wasn’t a member of the textbook commission and didn’t think any book-burning was likely to occur.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas officials are warning students to stay away from raccoons on campus after three students were bitten and received rabies vaccinations as a precaution. The UT Office of Campus Safety tweeted Wednesday that the university has seen “an increase of incidents involving raccoons and the UT student population where raccoons may be made bolder due to being fed by humans.” The raccoon in question is believed to be located around the outside of the McCombs School of Business and the Perry-Castañeda Library, and it might feel threatened by close contact, especially if it has offspring nearby, according to the UT Office of Campus Safety. The school said people should be aware of their surroundings in the area and seek medical attention immediately if they are scratched or bitten by a raccoon or any other wildlife. The university also is urging people to not approach raccoons with the intent to feed, pet or take pictures with the animals.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Canyon Overlook Trail, one of the oldest hikes in Zion National Park, is getting a facelift this summer, the park announced. With upgrades like improved trail tread, rehabilitated masonry, and handrails, the more than 5 million annual visitors to the nation’s second-most-popular national park will have an upgraded sight to see. “The (National Park Service) planned this work to protect the trail’s historic, rustic appearance and enhance safety for hikers,” officials said in a press release. The trail will be closed Monday to Thursday each week while work is underway until early June, and though it will be open most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, there might be intermittent closures on weekends. The Pine Creek canyoneering route and lower Pine Creek Drainage, with sections below the Canyon Overlook Trail, may be closed for short periods to “ensure safety,” the release said. “Canyoneers traveling this route need to be mindful of their surroundings, watch for signs showing closed areas, and be aware that work may be happening above them,” it said. The Canyon Overlook Trail is outside the east end of the Mount Carmel Tunnel and was originally built in the 1930s, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A foundation is working with the state community college system to provide a free, two-year college degree over the next five years. The J. Warren & Lois McClure Foundation announced the “Free Degree Promise through the Early College Program at CCV” on Tuesday for Vermont students in the high school classes of 2022-2026. In addition to providing tuition and fees after any federal and state financial aid, the foundation will provide career and education counseling and stipends to help pay for books, transportation and other college costs. The McClure foundation’s plan builds upon the Community College of Vermont’s Early College program that allows high school seniors to complete their last year of high school and first year of college at the same time. “Young people deserve a degree they can count on and afford,” McClure Foundation President Barbara Benedict said in a statement. “By guaranteeing this pathway through Early College to a free degree at CCV, we are telling Vermont’s young people we believe in them and we believe in their futures.” Vermont officials have been working for years to help alleviate what has become an acute labor shortage caused by declines in the number of working-age adults and the lack of trained workers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the House of Delegates voted Wednesday to remove their caucus leader, months after an unsuccessful election cycle that saw the party lose full control of the state government. The 48-member caucus voted by secret ballot to remove Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, who previously served as Virginia’s first female House speaker, according to lawmakers and staffers who spoke with reporters shortly after the vote. The membership voted against removing caucus chair Charniele Herring, lawmakers said. No immediate vote was held on who would fill Filler-Corn’s role. The vote on whether to remove the two women came after a campaign led in part by Del. Don Scott, an attorney and two-term House member from Portsmouth. Scott resigned a caucus leadership post, vice-chair for outreach, on Sunday and called for the election to remove Herring and Filler-Corn. He nominated himself to take over Filler-Corn’s role and nominated two young, progressive members to serve along with him. Filler-Corn, who served as the first female and first Jewish speaker of the House of Delegates for two years after Democrats flipped the chamber in 2019, conceded her role immediately. She called leading the caucus “the honor of my life.”\n\nWashington\n\nIssaquah: An invasive species is consuming and competing with native species in western Washington, including salmon. Scientists have spotted African clawed frogs in Issaquah, Lacey and Bothell, KING5 reports. The frogs were initially brought into the United States to be used in pregnancy tests and later became pets, said state wildlife scientist Max Lambert. Although Washington made it illegal to own them, some still do. Others who decided not to keep the frogs ultimately released them into ponds and streams. As officials began looking into the issue, they discovered hundreds of frogs. “These are considered one of the worst invasive species on earth,” Lambert said. “They’ll eat a lot of native insects, which are good forage food for our fishes and our amphibians, they will eat tadpoles of our native salamanders, and they’ll eat fish. We looked at some of their stomach contents – and they’re full of baby fish.” People working to restore salmon populations fear the frogs will infringe on that progress. Since Trout Unlimited began trapping in January, the organization has caught about 300 frogs, Rebecca Lavier said. About half of those have been found in the past few weeks. They believe it’s just a fraction of the population.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An investigation of conditions at a jail has found no evidence of inhumane treatment of inmates, Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday. The Republican governor ordered the investigation last month after a TV station reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper, and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress at the Southern Regional Jail in Beaver. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in a statement. The investigation by the state Department of Homeland Security determined inmates have continuous access to water at sinks in their cells and an industrial water fountain in each section of the jail. Every inmate is provided tumblers for water consumption, and the jail maintains a minimum three-day supply of bottled water for emergencies. In addition, inmates receive three drinks each day for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including those in segregation and quarantine units. There was no history of medical cases of dehydration, and no inmates have filed grievances for being deprived of water, according to jail records. In addition, ample toilet paper is provided to inmates, while the jail buys new mattresses for inmates regularly, according to the investigation.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Most of the respondents to the Wisconsin Conservation Congress’ spring survey say they support limiting the state’s wolf population to 350 animals. The congress, an influential group of sportspeople who advise the state Department of Natural Resources on policy, holds a survey each spring gauging respondents’ support for a wide range of outdoor and environmental proposals. This year’s survey was conducted online earlier this month. One question asked if the respondent supports limiting the wolf population to 350 animals. Of the Wisconsin residents who responded, 12,978 said they supported that number, 6,410 said they did not, and 2,277 had no opinion. Overall, 13,136 respondents said they supported the limit, 6,633 said they did not, and 2,326 had no opinion. The results are advisory only. The question comes as the DNR is revising its wolf management plan. A draft is expected to be released by June. The DNR’s current wolf management plan dates back to 1999 and lays out a goal of 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have held up the number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The virtual emergency room visits that a hospital began allowing early in the COVID-19 pandemic have been suspended, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Cheyenne Regional Medical Center’s telehealth visits began as a way to screen patients from home so that some could avoid visiting the hospital and risking the spread of the coronavirus, but as the virus’s spread “has cooled down,” CRMC is pausing the program and considering changes, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}]}

And the drop in value of Ford’s investment in Argo caused it to take a $2.7 billion charge in the just-completed third quarter. That resulted in an $827 million loss in the period.\n\nEven excluding the special charges for Argo and other items, Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents, a slide from the 51 cents it earned on that basis a year ago, but a slight improvement over the 27 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nFord reported automotive revenue of $37.2 billion, a jump of $4 billion from a year ago and $1 billion more than the analysts’ forecasts. The revenue was helped by a $3.4 billion from higher pricing on vehicles.\n\nFord did have some problems in the quarter beyond the charge it took for closing down Argo. It said supply shortages left it with about 40,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of the quarter that were built but awaiting needed parts before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nIt also was hit with $1 billion in higher-than-expected supplier payments, and a $1.5 billion increase in commodity costs.\n\nAnd it had a smaller profit and profit margin in its core North American market due to those higher commodity costs, and a loss in China, due to costs associated with the development of electric vehicles.\n\nWhile higher pricing on vehicles helped its European unit post a narrow profit in the quarter compared to a narrow loss a year ago, CEO Jim Farley did concede, “Our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.”\n\nBut, in good news, Ford raised its goal for full-year cash that will be generated by the business to be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion — up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion — on strength in the company’s automotive operations.\n\nShares of Ford (F) were down 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news.\n\nBut in the end, the big news of the earnings report was a major change in direction on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe company insists it still expects to offer full self-driving vehicles in the future, just not soon enough to make the investment such technology will require today. It said it decided it is better to invest in driver assistance technology that is closer to being implemented on vehicles today, and that customers want from their new cars, rather than a fleet of robo-taxis with no drivers at all aboard.\n\n“We’re optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” said Farley.\n\nFarley said he expects to be able to find jobs for many of the Argo employees at Ford, having them switch gears to develop L3 driver assistance features.\n\n“That’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo… we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief advanced product development and technology officer.\n\nHe said there is only so much talent available to develop the different driver assistance and self-driving features.\n\n“So this is the way we want to use that talent,” he said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland", "Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/business/ford-argo-ai-vw-shut-down/index.html", "title": "Ford, VW pull plug on robotaxis in blow to self-driving car industry ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nFord and Volkswagen, two of the world’s largest automakers, are shutting down their joint effort to develop self-driving cars, the startup Argo AI.\n\nFord said Wednesday that it had concluded that the large-scale profitable commercialization of self-driving cars was further out then expected.\n\nThe company is still “optimistic” about a future for fully self-driving cars, “but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement as part of the company’s larger report on its third quarter earnings.\n\nThe automaker will instead focus on simpler driver-assist technologies that have proven easier to develop and bring to market. Some Argo AI employees will join Ford for that work, Farley said. Ford offers a driver-assist technology called BlueCruise that is positioned as a rival to Tesla’s Autopilot software.\n\nVW described similar plans in a statement.\n\n“Our goal is to offer our customers the most powerful functions at the earliest possible time and to set up our development as cost-effectively as possible,” VW CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement.\n\nArgo AI confirmed in a statement that it would be shutting down.\n\n“Many of the employees will receive an opportunity to continue work on automated driving technology with either Ford or Volkswagen, while employment for others will unfortunately come to an end,” Argo AI said in a statement.\n\nArgo was founded in 2016 and had fewer than 200 employees in 2017.

The company was developing robotaxis, self-driving vehicles that can operate in a ridehail service that does not require human drivers. Argo AI was also developing self-driving delivery vehicles and had worked on related programs in US cities.\n\nThe team effort allowed Ford and VW to share the hefty costs of developing self-driving cars.\n\nThen-Ford CEO Jim Hackett said at the time that Argo AI would allow the company to “showcase the power of our global alliance in this era of smart vehicles for a smart world.”\n\nArgo AI CEO Bryan Salesky had spent three years working on Google’s self-driving car program, now known as Waymo, which kicked off the industry in 2009.

The company only recently resumed car testing in Pennsylvania, where the ATG division is based.\n\nUber's trucking efforts were kicked off when then-CEO Travis Kalanick made a deal in 2016 with former Google car veteran Anthony Levandowski to buy Otto, Levandowski's months-old self-driving truck start-up, for around $680 million.\n\nMore:Vending machines are coming to Uber\n\nMore:Business travelers increasingly use Lyft ride-hailing services\n\nBut last year, amid a series of corporate scandals related to Uber's culture and tactics that saw Kalanick depart, Waymo filed suit against Uber, claiming that Levandowski had stolen thousands of proprietary files related to Waymo's LiDAR sensor technology, which helps a vehicle see its environment via lasers.\n\nUber maintained that it did not use any stolen material to develop LiDAR, and fired Levandowski. When the case finally went to trial, it took just one week for Uber's lawyers to settle the case for around $245 million in Uber stock — with no admission of guilt.\n\nUber said Monday that it intends to continue to pour money into proprietary LiDAR development.\n\nUber's decision to shutter its trucking effort, first reported by TechCrunch, does not effect Uber Freight, a company focused on matching truckers with loads through an app, the company said.

VW declined to comment.\n\nArgo AI’s workforce had grown to about 2,000 people from more than 1,000 in 2020. The layoffs were first reported by Automotive News. The closing of Argo AI’s DC operation has not been previously reported.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley had said on the company’s latest earnings call this spring that self-driving technology is “expensive stuff,” and that it was becoming more interested in using the tech for moving things like cargo.\n\nMany of Argo AI’s competitors, including Alphabet’s Waymo and Toyota-backed Aurora, have already chosen to focus more on self-driving trucks, which industry experts say are much easier to build than robotaxis. The self-driving industry, including Argo AI, have learned that it’s a tall order to teach a vehicle to safely navigate a bustling city, with construction sites, pedestrians, cyclists and emergency vehicles. Trucks, on the other hand, mostly stick to highways.\n\nFarley also described access to capital as “very critical” as the automakers seek to fund Argo AI for “many years to come.” Startups are finding it more challenging to raise funding this year amid inflation, rising interest rates, a declining stock market and faltering economy.\n\nArgo AI was founded in 2016 and Ford became the majority stakeholder in 2017.

Matt McFarland/CNN\n\nArgo AI appears to be making significant progress toward a robotaxi service. In May, it announced it was offering self-driving rides without a human test driver behind the wheel to its employees in Austin and Miami.

It planned for the DC robotaxi service to be its second market after Miami, where it was already testing.\n\nSherif Marakby, who was then CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, said at the time that expanding to DC was “an enormous opportunity to understand how a comprehensive self-driving business could be utilized.” Marakby left Ford in 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe city will need to develop a policy to certify such a service, but that’s not being created currently, according to German Vigil, a spokesperson for the District Department of Transportation.\n\nArgo AI and Ford declined to say if regulations were a factor in the departure.\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify the relationship of Ford and Argo AI.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/us/five-things-october-27-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Oct. 27: Weapons test, Trump, Iran, Lake Mead ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

This comes after the military completed a successful test launch Wednesday to collect information on components of hypersonic missiles, including heat-resistant materials and high-end electronics. The Pentagon has made the development of hypersonic weapons one of its top priorities after China conducted successful hypersonic launches last year and Russia has begun using hypersonic missiles in its war on Ukraine. Hypersonic weapons travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or approximately 4,000 miles per hour, making them difficult to detect and intercept in time. The missiles can also maneuver and vary altitude, allowing them to evade missile defense systems. Separately, Biden administration officials on Wednesday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been warned of the “potential for dire consequences” if Moscow uses a nuclear weapon to attack Ukraine.\n\n2. Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has announced a Florida rally that will prominently feature Sen. Marco Rubio – but will notably exclude Gov. Ron DeSantis, even though he is currently running for reelection in the state. The rally comes as the relationship between Trump and DeSantis, once allies, has grown distant ahead of a possible presidential showdown in 2024. Trump is also annoyed that DeSantis has not said he wouldn’t run in 2024 if the former President entered the race, one source said. Meanwhile, Trump has been accelerating his plans for another presidential bid with recent campaign stops in Nevada, Ohio, Arizona and Michigan. He is also spending the rest of 2022 preparing his political operation – including assembling his campaign leadership, hatching plans for his remaining midterm rallies, and searching for a venue from which to launch his perceived political comeback.\n\n3. Iran\n\nThe US has imposed a slew of new sanctions against Iranian officials involved in the ongoing crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran. The Biden administration’s punitive measures on Iran come as the US and Europe work to counter Iran and Russia’s growing cooperation on the war in Ukraine. Russian forces have in recent weeks pummeled Ukrainian cities with Iranian drones. State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said last week that the “deepening” of relations between Russia and Iran should be seen as “a profound threat.” Separately, CNN has obtained exclusive visual evidence surrounding the death of Iranian teenager Nika Shahkarami, a 16-year-old protester who was found dead in Tehran last month. The Iranian government has said she died after falling from a building’s roof, but videos and testimony are raising fresh questions about officials’ claims.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive evidence shows protester was chased and then detained by police before disappearance 04:01 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Lake Mead\n\nA diver has found more human remains in Lake Mead, marking at least the sixth such discovery this year. The National Park Service confirmed the “finding of human skeletal remains” after the diver discovered what appeared to be a human bone on October 17. This latest finding comes as the water level of the massive lake continues to drop due to a prolonged drought. Declining water levels at the lake have also uncovered relics including sunken boats, a World War II-era landing craft and ancient volcanic rock. Lake Mead, which straddles the Nevada-Arizona border, is the nation’s largest reservoir and serves about 25 million people in Arizona, Nevada, California and New Mexico.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch as a sunken boat emerges from Lake Mead 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Self-driving cars\n\nFord and Volkswagen, two of the world’s largest automakers, are shutting down their joint effort to develop self-driving cars. Ford said Wednesday that it had concluded that the large-scale profitable commercialization of self-driving cars was further out than expected, and therefore would take a $2.7 billion hit to walk away from the startup Argo AI. The company said it is still “optimistic” about a future for fully self-driving cars, but added that “profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off.” Instead of having Argo develop self-driving car technology for cars without steering wheels, brakes or accelerator pedals, Ford said it will instead focus on simpler driver-assist technologies that have proven easier to develop and bring to market.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nTaylor Swift’s ‘Anti-Hero’ music video angers some viewers\n\nFollowing swift criticism online, Apple Music removed a controversial scene from the Grammy-winner’s new music video.\n\nChipotle is testing a robotic tortilla chip maker\n\nIn queso you didn’t know, Chipotle is testing a robot named “Chippy” that could debut in several locations soon.

We’re still working on the details of what’s next,” the company wrote in a brief statement shared on its LinkedIn and Twitter pages. Kittyhawk did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nKittyhawk had the lofty mission of “building autonomous, affordable, ubiquitous and eco-conscious air taxis,” according to its website. It was founded by Sebastian Thrun, a former Google executive who led the company’s self-driving car efforts.\n\nThe startup operated in secret until 2017, when it publicly unveiled its first aircraft — an ultralight electric plane dubbed Flyer that was designed to fly over water. Page, one of the world’s richest men, was said to have invested $100 million in flying car startups, including Kittyhawk.\n\nFlyer was ultimately retired in 2020, after more than 25,000 successful test flights, according to the company, and it reportedly laid off many of those who had been working on Flyer at the time. The company launched other electric aircraft prototypes and announced a partnership with Boeing in 2019.\n\nThe shuttering of Kittyhawk will not impact its joint venture with Boeing, which has been dubbed Wisk. In a tweet, Wisk said that it remains “in a strong financial position,” with both Boeing and Kittyhawk as investors.\n\nLike Kittyhawk, Wisk is developing an “all-electric, self-flying air taxi” that it says “rises like a helicopter and flies like a plane,” according to its website.

It isn't worth it.” His next: \"The comma one is cancelled.\"\n\nHotz, who first made a name for himself as a teen hacker who jailbroke an iPhone, suggested on Twitter that he would be pivoting his company to focus on new products and technologies.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz declined to comment. An email to Hotz, whose tweets suggested he was in China, did not get an immediate reply.\n\nU.S. aims to tame 'Wild West' of self-driving cars\n\nThe two-page letter from NHTSA lawyer Paul Hemmersbaugh does not call for Hotz to close Comma.ai. Rather, it encourages Hotz to \"delay selling or deploying your product on the public roadways unless and until you can ensure it is safe.\"\n\nIt closes, however, with a note that non-compliance to the letter could trigger fines of up to $21,000 a day.\n\nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx recently released a 116-page policy document that aims to guide automakers and technologists on best-practices when it comes to the manufacturing and deployment of autonomous vehicle features.\n\nThe Comma.ai news, which was first reported by tech site The Verge, comes after a flurry of activity in the self-driving car world.\n\nUber is busy picking up Pittsburgh passengers in self-driving cars. Ford says it will produce a car with no pedals or steering wheel by 2021. And an array of small startups such as Drive.ai are trying to break new technological ground in transportation using machine learning.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who had publicly sparred with Hotz and claimed that one person in a garage couldn't do the scientific work necessary to develop self-driving tech, recently announced that he would build all Teslas with autonomous hardware that one day would allow motorists to completely disconnect from the task of driving.\n\nFive cities chosen for self-driving car test\n\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt here last month, Hotz took the stage to say that Comma One was “fully functional, and about on par with Tesla Autopilot.\"\n\nPioneering technologist turned investor Marc Andreessen also appeared at the tech conference, where he praised the lone wolf approach to solving complex tech problems.\n\n\"He is one brilliant person, not 1,500 people,\" said Andreessen, a reference to the number of employees that his friend Jeff Bezos said he deployed on building voice assistant Alexa.\n\nIncreasingly, the division of labor between tech and auto companies is becoming clearer as self-driving mobility advances, with the former largely serving as tech supplies to the latter.\n\nUber is in a $300 million partnership with Volvo to develop self-driving tech, while Google is in a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to automate Pacifica minivans. Apple, which has been rumored to be building a car, recently laid off employees of its automotive project and pivoted from making a car to creating autonomous software, according to reports.\n\nWho's hiring for self-driving car jobs\n\nHotz was hardly on a lark by starting a company that aimed to sell kits that would, at least initially, turn various Acura models into cars that had a high degree of self-driving features, although not full autonomy.\n\nA small startup called Cruise Automation had the same approach, and last March was purchased by General Motors for $1 billion.\n\nAnother aftermarket self-driving tech company recently completed a successful 120-mile beer delivery without anyone at the wheel.\n\nA big rig cab equipped with sensors made by Otto, a startup bought by Uber recently for $670 million, made the delivery of Budweiser beer while its driver rested in the sleeper berth during most of the trip down Colorado's Interstate 25.\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/business/tesla-fsd-california-dmv/index.html", "title": "Tesla's 'full self-driving' feature may have finally met its match | CNN ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\n“Full self-driving,” the controversially named driver-assist feature from Tesla, may have finally met its match.\n\nTesla’s foil isn’t a silver-haired US Senator, world-class autonomous driving experts, or some of the country’s preeminent safety advocates. They’ve all warned that “full self-driving” isn’t really full self-driving. The technology is designed to navigate local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, but it requires an attentive human driver who’s ready to take control and correct the system, which “may do the wrong thing at the worst time,” Tesla warns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Elon Musk wants to end traffic. The company he built to do it may not deliver 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\nBut while these critics may have the traditional bully pulpit of the Senate or other institutions, they have no real power to change any policy on their own. An actual impact may instead come from an unglamorous public agency, one that many Americans think of as only capable of offering customers long wait times: the Department of Motor Vehicles. The California DMV has become the first US government entity to formally move against the naming of “full self-driving.”\n\nAutomotive regulation has traditionally fallen to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, and Congress, which can push NHTSA to regulate specific things like driver-assist technology. But NHTSA and Congress have spent recent years swept away in the excitement and lobbying surrounding a more eye-catching technology — fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nNHTSA has even exempted some robotaxis from its safety standards, and described many potential benefits of these technologies, including improved quality of life, safer roads, shorter commutes, lower energy usage and more access to jobs. It’s claimed in the past that leaving “breathing room for innovation” led to the development of technologies like air bags. Self-driving cars and trucks could, in theory, revolutionize transportation and save millions of lives if crashes become rarer, as supporters of the technology have predicted.\n\nCalifornia's DMV appears poised to take action on Tesla's \"full self-driving.\" Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a law related to self-driving cars. It hasn’t acted on the more pedestrian driver-assist technologies.\n\nNHTSA has no standards for these systems, which has effectively left automakers like Tesla to decide what’s safe enough. But there are strong signs in the last year that NHTSA is shifting some of its attention to driver-assist technologies. It announced last summer, for instance, that automakers must report driver-assist crashes.\n\nNHTSA has also cited its powers to protect the public from motor vehicle risks that it received when created in 1970.\n\n“Given the rapid evolution of these technologies and testing of new technologies and features on publicly accessible roads, it is critical for NHTSA to exercise its robust oversight over potential safety defects,” it said.\n\nNHTSA has even taken steps toward standards for one driver-assist feature, automatic emergency braking. But the first major regulatory impact may be from that unlikely candidate, the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nMost Americans’ interactions with their own state DMV is limited to dreary, underfunded offices with long lines and beleaguered staff. Most people are there to fill out forms and pay fees for various bureaucratic duties that the agency undertakes.\n\nBut that is not the entirety of the California DMV.\n\nIt has long been a leader in regulating autonomous vehicles, largely due to the fact many companies developing autonomous vehicles are based in California. It released its own rules for testing autonomous vehicles in 2015, and hasn’t backed down from conflict.\n\nUber provoked the DMV in 2017 when it tested autonomous vehicles in San Francisco without a required DMV permit. The DMV revoked Uber’s vehicles’ registrations in response, and Uber pulled its cars from San Francisco streets. (Uber fled to the looser regulations of Arizona, but was kicked out of the state in 2018 after one of its test vehicles was involved in a high-profile fatal crash. It then sold its robotaxi business in 2020.)\n\nNow, the California DMV is flexing the type of muscle that could force Tesla to drop the name “full self-driving,” according to autonomous driving experts.\n\nThe DMV recently filed a complaint that says Tesla’s description of its driver-assist technologies, Autopilot and “full self-driving,” is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking its license to sell motor vehicles in the state. The risk of losing such a license may force Tesla’s hand. The automaker was founded in California, it’s made most of its cars in California, and its vehicles are among the best-selling in California. “Full self-driving” is even designed to be at its best in California’s San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTesla’s use of the words “full self-driving” and “Autopilot,” as well as its descriptors of the technology on its website, suggest the vehicles are autonomous, when they aren’t, the DMV says in its complaint.\n\nTesla has long qualified the limits of its systems with disclaimers. But the DMV says in its complaint that one Tesla disclaimer “contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation.”\n\nIt’s unclear how Tesla and the DMV’s differences might be resolved, and the conflict could include lengthy litigation.\n\nA settlement could include changes to how Tesla talks about the systems on its website, a promise to avoid similar behavior in the future, or even new names for its products, according to Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researches autonomous vehicles.\n\n“Full self-driving describes a system that is used by a driver. That’s making me dizzy,” Smith said. “How can a driver use a full self-driving system?”\n\nTesla claimed in 2016 that all its new vehicles had the hardware capability for “full self-driving,” and it would soon offer complementary software for the cars to drive themselves. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. Tesla has released a beta version of “full self-driving” to more than 100,000 drivers, but the software requires constant vigilance as it sometimes makes dangerous decisions.\n\nThis is not the first fight over this type of language. A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla’s language was misleading, which the automaker appealed last year.\n\nWaymo chose to stop using the term \"self-driving\" and refers to its vehicles as fully autonomous. Andrej Sokolow/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nWaymo, the self-driving subsidiary of Google’s parent company, stopped using the term “self-driving” in 2021, saying that misuse by other automakers was giving the public a false impression of its capabilities. Waymo began referring to its robotaxis as “fully autonomous.” Waymo, which operates robotaxis in the Phoenix area, does not need a human in the driver’s seat to ensure safe operation.\n\nThe California DMV’s actions are officially limited to the state, but the impact could be much greater. It’s routine for California to lead on regulations and for other states to follow, such as vehicle emission standards. California’s large population makes tailoring vehicles just for that state too expensive for most automakers.\n\n“Once you talk about one state investigating, you could talk about 50 states potentially investigating,” said Smith, adding that it will become easier politically and factually. “They’re not putting their necks out.”\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/companies-pulling-back-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Companies pulling back from Russia over the war in Ukraine | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nDozens of the world’s biggest companies have abandoned or scaled back their operations in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exodus affects every corner of the economy, from its vast energy riches through autos, finance, retail, entertainment and fast food, starving Russia of new investment and removing products and services that had become popular in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHere’s a look at the major corporate departures.\n\nAutos\n\nFord (F) announced it was suspending its operations in Russia.

Artyom Geodakyan/TASS/Getty Images\n\nThe company has plants in St. Petersburg, Elabuga and Naberezhnye Chelny but said it had “significantly wound down” its Russian operations in recent years. The automaker said it was “deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine,” and noted it has “a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working at Ford around the world.”\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) said it was halting all exports to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nGM doesn’t have a significant presence there: It sells only about 3,000 vehicles a year through 16 dealerships, according to a spokesperson. That’s out of the more than 6 million vehicles the Detroit-based automaker sells annually.\n\nToyota announced it would stop making cars in Russia or importing them to the country “until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions.”\n\nVolkswagen (VLKAF) is stopping production of vehicles in Russia and has suspended exports to the Russian market. The decision applies to the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nNissan (NSANF) has suspended the export of vehicles to Russia, adding that it “anticipates that production will stop soon at our plant in St. Petersburg.”\n\nAviation\n\nBoeing (BA) said it would suspend support for Russian airlines.\n\nA company spokesperson confirmed the aircraft maker was pausing “parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,” and had also “suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv.”\n\nAirbus (EADSF) followed Boeing with a similar move. In a statement, the company said it has “suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country.”\n\nBig Tech\n\nAirbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that his company was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)’s cloud division, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, said March 8 it would halt new sign-ups for the service in Russia and Belarus. The company has already had a “long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government” and does not have data centers, infrastructure or offices in Russia, the company said in a blog post.\n\n“AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services,” Amazon said. “Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended.”\n\nApple (AAPL) has stopped selling its products in Russia.\n\nThe tech giant said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” about the Russian invasion. In response, the company has also moved to limit access to digital services, such as Apple Pay, inside Russia, and restricted the availability of Russian state media applications outside the country.\n\nA re:Store shop in central Moscow. re:Store is one of the largest Apple resellers in Russia. Vladimir Gerdo/TASS/Getty Images\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta said it would block access to Russian news outlets Sputnik and RT, the Russia-backed television network infamous for promoting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda, across the European Union.\n\nThe move comes after the company received “requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s VP of global affairs, wrote in a tweet.\n\nMeta has also said it has applied algorithmic restrictions on Russian state media that should prevent those posts from surfacing as prominently in users’ feeds.\n\nHitachi (HTHIY) said March 10 that it is pausing exports to Russia and suspending all manufacturing in the country, “with the exception of products, services and support for electrical power equipment that are indispensable to the daily lives of people,” it said.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate added that Russia accounts for just a small fraction — roughly 0.5% — of its revenue.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has suspended all business in Russia.\n\n“In Ukraine, we have been in constant touch with our local teams and continue to provide assistance that includes relocation and financial support,” Krishna said. “The safety and security of IBMers and their families in all areas impacted by this crisis remains our top priority.”\n\nIntel (INTC) said April 5 that it has suspended business operations in Russia. Earlier this year, the company said it stopped all shipments to Russia and Belarus.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) said it was suspending all new sales of its products and services in Russia. President and vice-chair Brad Smith also said the company is stopping “many aspects” of its business in Russia in compliance with government sanctions. Microsoft (MSFT) also said it will continue aiding in Ukrainian cybersecurity.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) said it will be suspending its streaming service in Russia.\n\n“Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia,” a Netflix spokesperson told CNN.\n\nNo other details were provided.\n\nPreviously, the company said it was refusing to air Russian state TV channels — something that the platform would have been required to do starting this week under Russian law.\n\n“Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service,” the company told CNN Business.\n\nNintendo (NTDOF) has stopped taking online orders in Russia.\n\nIn a statement on its Russian website, the Switch console maker said that it had “suspended the processing of payments in rubles,” and temporarily set its digital store on “maintenance mode.”\n\nRoku (ROKU), which sells hardware allowing users to stream content through the internet, has banned RT worldwide.\n\nSony (SNE) has halted all software and hardware shipments, and temporarily suspended orders on its online PlayStation store in Russia.\n\nThe entertainment giant has also paused plans to launch Gran Turismo 7, a driving simulator game, in the country. Sony “joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” it said in a statement.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) said it has closed its office in Russia “indefinitely” and restricted shows “owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media.” The streaming service removed all content from RT and Sputnik in Europe and other regions, a company spokesman said.\n\n“We are deeply shocked and saddened by the unprovoked attack on Ukraine,” the spokesman added. “Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever.”\n\nTwitter (TWTR) has similarly announced plans to “reduce the visibility and amplification” of Russian state media content.\n\nYouTube, which is owned by Google (GOOGL), said it blocked Russian state media within Ukraine, including RT. The video platform also said it would be “significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.” Google (GOOGL) and YouTube have also said they will no longer allow Russian state media outlets to run ads or monetize their content.\n\nConsulting\n\nAccenture is discontinuing its business in Russia as it “stands with the people of Ukraine,” it said.\n\nThe firm announced the move in a statement on March 3, where it thanked its “nearly 2,300 colleagues in Russia for their dedication and service to Accenture over the years.”\n\n“We will be providing support to our Russian colleagues,” the company added.\n\nIn a similar move, Deloitte announced on March 7 that it would stop operating in Russia and Belarus.\n\n“While we know this is the right decision, it will have an impact on Deloitte’s [approximately] 3,000 professionals located in Russia and Belarus. Like others, we know our colleagues in Russia and Belarus have no voice in the actions of their government,” the firm said.\n\n“We will support all impacted colleagues during this transition and do all we can to assist them during this extremely difficult time.”\n\nEY, otherwise known as Ernst & Young, also said it would remove its Russian practice from its official global network, but allow it to “continue working with clients as an independent group of audit and consulting companies.”\n\n“EY in Russia is a team of 4,700 professionals working in 9 cities of the country. The company has been operating in the Russian market for more than 30 years,” it said on March 7.\n\n“In light of the escalating war, the EY global organization will no longer serve any Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world.”\n\nConsulting and accounting firm KPMG International said that its “Russia and Belarus firms will leave the KPMG network.”\n\n“KPMG has over 4,500 people in Russia and Belarus, and ending our working relationship with them, many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades, is incredibly difficult,” the company said. “This decision is not about them – it is a consequence of the actions of the Russian Government.

Employees will still be paid.\n\nBurger King said it is pulling corporate support from its businesses in Russia. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the burger chain, said it “has suspended all of its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that Burger King restaurants will be closed in Russia, however, as the company said the chain’s roughly 800 locations there are “fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.” This means that the company cannot simply pull the plug on those restaurants as other brands such as McDonald’s have done.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) said that it is “suspending its business in Russia.” The company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n\nHeineken will stop producing and selling beer in Russia.

The six-hour event will include updates on Tesla (TSLA)’s work in artificial intelligence, “Full Self-Driving,” its supercomputer “Dojo” and maybe a humanoid robot, according to invitations posted online by Tesla (TSLA) supporters. The event is expected to be live-streamed.\n\nDojo is a supercomputer being designed to train AI systems to complete complex tasks like Tesla’s driver-assistance systems Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving,” which sometimes perform some driving tasks like steering and keeping up with traffic. Tesla’s previous AI Day included detailed technical explanations of the company’s work in a bid to attract leading engineers.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed before that in the long run people will think of Tesla as an AI company, rather than a car company or energy company. He has said that Tesla AI may play a role in computers matching general human abilities, a huge milestone many experts say is decades away and perhaps unattainable. Musk, who has a long history of predictions, has said it may be reached in 2029.\n\nBut more limited and easier to develop forms of artificial intelligence — like identifying emergency vehicles stopped on a highway — have proven to be a significant hurdle for the company as it pursues its dreams of self-driving cars. AI powers “Full Self-Driving,” but the system has faced criticism and backlash as it still requires driver intervention to prevent collisions and Musk’s deadlines for its capabilities slip year after year.\n\nAnd this summer Tesla’s director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, exited the company, several months after it was announced he was taking a sabbatical.\n\nIt’s not easy to predict what may or may not show up at any event helmed by Musk. Products heralded and talked about sometimes don’t perform as designed — like when Musk showed off the Tesla Cybertruck’s supposedly “unbreakable” windows, that promptly broke — and can’t even be bought years later. (Three years after the event Tesla sells a T-shirt that memorializes the broken window, but it has yet to sell a Cybertruck.)\n\nMusk has unquestionably disrupted entire industries with his work at Tesla and SpaceX. But he’s also earned a reputation for missing deadlines and overpromising.\n\nLast year’s AI Day “surprise,” for instance, was a Tesla “robot,” which was just a human dancing in a suit.\n\nMusk then claimed that the automaker is building a 5-foot-8, 125-pound humanoid robot, called Optimus or Tesla Bot and a prototype would likely be unveiled this year. It’s unclear if a prototype will be revealed Friday, but Musk tweeted Thursday that the event would include “cool hardware demos.”\n\nTesla is also working on wheeled robots for manufacturing and autonomous logistics, according to a Tesla job posting for a senior humanoid mechatronics robotics architect.\n\nMusk claimed last year that the humanoid robot would have a profound impact on the economy. It would begin by working on boring, repetitive and dangerous tasks, he said.\n\nTesla and Musk are not, of course, the first to bet on robots. Robots already handle many factory jobs, and companies like Boston Dynamics have worked for years to develop humanoid, animal-like, and other robots for industrial applications.\n\nHumanoid robots have long fascinated the public and earned a place in pop culture as powerful but sometimes dangerous. Tesla tapped into this when it posted on Instagram in a promotion for the event that, “if you can run faster than 5 mph, you’ll be fine.” The Tesla humanoid robot is planned to have a top speed of 5 mph, the automaker has said.\n\nBut creating a humanoid robot that rivals a human’s abilities has proved incredibly difficult for robotics experts. Artificial intelligence has seen major advances yet trails the general abilities of a human toddler. Most robots in use today are restricted to simple tasks in basic environments like vacuuming a home or moving parts in a factory.\n\nTesla would not be the first automaker to build a humanoid robot, either. Honda worked on a series of robots, known as Asimo, for nearly 20 years. The Japanese company shut down development of Asimo in 2018. Korean automaker Hyundai bought Boston Dynamics in 2020.\n\nMusk said Thursday that AI Day would be “highly technical” as it is meant for recruiting engineers to work on artificial intelligence, robotics and computer chips.\n\n“Engineers who understand what problems need to be solved will like what they see,” Musk tweeted Friday.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}]}

He was 68.\n\nCarter, who led the Defense Department from February 2015 to January 2017, suffered a “sudden cardiac event” on Monday night in Boston, his family said in a statement. He is survived by his wife, Stephanie, and his children, Ava and Will.\n\nCarter was a “a man of extraordinary integrity” who was “guided by a strong, steady moral compass and a vision of using his life for public purpose,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“I was Vice President at the time, and President Obama and I relied on Ash’s fierce intellect and wise counsel to ensure our military’s readiness, technological edge, and obligation to the women and men of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world,” Biden said.\n\nIn leading the Pentagon, Carter oversaw the final years of US involvement in Afghanistan under Obama’s presidency and US efforts to combat the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, which included the deployment of US troops. His tenure also saw efforts to expand the available roles of women in combat as well as lifting a ban on transgender people being able to serve openly.\n\nTaking over from Chuck Hagel, who was forced out as defense secretary in November 2014, Carter was immediately tasked with addressing the rise of ISIS, which by then had taken significant territory in Iraq. Although Obama had made withdrawing US military forces from Iraq a key priority of his foreign policy, he ultimately recommitted US troops to the country to deal with the terrorist group.\n\n“It’s necessary but not sufficient to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria because this is where it began and is what I have called the parent tumor of the cancer,” Carter, using another term for the group, told reporters during a visit to Baghdad in 2016.\n\n“Like cancer, ISIL has spread to … other places and it also threatens our homelands,” he said then.\n\nUnder Carter’s leadership, all US military combat positions were opened up to women, and in 2016, the Pentagon lifted a ban on out transgender people being able to serve.\n\nHaving studied the issue for almost a year, he said at the time that the decision was “a matter of principle.”\n\n“We don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission. We have to have access to 100% of America’s population,” he said. “Although relatively few in number, we’re talking about talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction,” he said. “We want to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we’ve invested in and who’ve proven themselves.”\n\nRegarded as a “technocrat” in part due to his degrees in theoretical physics and medieval history from Yale and Oxford – he authored or co-authored 11 books and over 100 articles on physics, technology, national security and management, according to his Department of Defense biography – Carter had a long and distinguished career in government. His career began in 1981, working as an analyst in the Office of Technology Assessment, International Security and Commerce Program for Congress. He served at the Pentagon as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under then-President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1996 and as under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn late 2014, following the Republican takeover of the Senate, Obama was looking for a new defense secretary who would not only better address the rise of ISIS but would be able to be confirmed. In announcing Carter as his selection, Obama said, “having served both Republican and Democratic Secretaries, he’s respected and trusted on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe announcement was met with widespread praise. Sen. John McCain, then the incoming Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, called him “one of America’s most respected defense professionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.”\n\nCarter was confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 93 to 5.\n\nCarter was also a recipient of the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal, which is the highest award given to civilians from the department, on multiple occasions. At the time of his death, he had been a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School as the Belfer professor of technology and global affairs, and director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and reaction.", "authors": ["Karl De Vries Shawna Mizelle", "Karl De Vries", "Shawna Mizelle"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/25/ash-carter-obama-defense-secretary-dies/10595312002/", "title": "Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter dies; he served last two years ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who served in the final two years of the Obama administration, died Monday, according to a statement from his family.\n\nCarter oversaw the initial Pentagon effort to attack the Islamic State militants who had seized huge chunks of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and had established a caliphate. In an earlier Pentagon post, Carter took the lead on the military's efforts to protect troops from roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2017, Carter led the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School.\n\nCarter died of a \"sudden cardiac event\" Monday evening in Boston, according to the family's statement. He was 68.\n\n\"He was a beloved husband, father, mentor, and friend,\" the statement said. \"His sudden loss will be felt by all who knew him.\"\n\nA Rhodes Scholar and theoretical physicist, Carter had served in several senior posts at the Pentagon, including overseeing weapons acquisition and as deputy secretary before Obama nominated him for the top job. Unlike many of his predecessors, including Obama's previous three defense chiefs, Carter had not served in the military.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nCarter helped spearhead the Pentagon's effort to field Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an interview in 2012, Carter, as Deputy Defense Secretary, told USA TODAY that troops traveling in the trucks were 14 times more likely to survive a bomb blast than those in Humvees. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates had made MRAPs the Pentagon's top priority after reading USA TODAY's reporting on the trucks. Gates credited MRAPs with saving thousands of lives.\n\nCarter pushed the Pentagon to deploy more surveillance equipment to battlefields to protect troops and became involved in efforts to train and deploy bomb-sniffing dogs.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Carter to be Defense Secretary in November 2014. Beginning in 2015, Carter ushered in major changes to the way the military treated troops. All combat jobs were opened to women, transgender troops were allowed to serve openly and the military's retirement system was modified to allow 401(k)s for service members.\n\nIn late 2015, Carter ordered the deployment of special operations troops, backed by a U.S.-led bombing campaign, to train and assist local ground forces retaking ground from ISIS militants. The campaign ultimately rolled back ISIS gains and eliminated their brutal caliphate governing structure, although militants remain.\n\nObama on Tuesday praised Carter for making America and the world safer.\n\n\"As president, I relied on Ash’s strategic counsel as we invested in innovation and a stronger, smarter, more humane, and more effective military for the long term,\" Obama said in a statement. \"Under his leadership, America accelerated its counterterrorism efforts, opened combat roles to women, modernized its weapons systems, and strengthened our alliances around the world.\"\n\nCarter is survived by his wife, Stephanie, and his children, Ava and Will.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/us/five-things-october-26-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for October 26: Senate race, Jan. 6, Iran, Voting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz are vying for votes in Pennsylvania in a race that is considered the Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat in the Senate, with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey retiring at the end of the term. During the debate, Fetterman’s delivery was at times halting and repetitive, dropping words during answers and occasionally losing his train of thought.

Much of the attention heading into the debate focused on how Fetterman’s struggle with auditory processing and speech could impact the conversation against Oz, a celebrity doctor who rose to fame by hosting a daily television show for years.

January 6\n\nThe Justice Department is asking a federal judge to force two of former President Donald Trump’s White House lawyers to testify about their conversations with the former President, according to three people familiar with the investigation. The move to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin just last week is part of a set of secret court proceedings. Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations about the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators. Separately, Hope Hicks, who served as Trump’s communications director, is being called back for a formal interview with the House select committee investigating the insurrection, a source familiar with the details told CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Most aggressive subpoena I've ever seen': Honig on Jan 6 committee's latest move 04:23 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Iran\n\nAnti-government protests have gripped Iran since the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being taken by morality police to a “re-education center” for apparently not wearing her hijab properly. Today marks the 40th day since her death and in Iranian culture, the 40-day mark of a person’s passing is an important day of mourning. According to Iran’s state-run media IRNA, Amini’s family will not hold a gathering for her passing today in an effort to quell the violence. “Considering the circumstances and in order to avoid any unfortunate problem, we will not hold a ceremony marking the 40th day,” the family’s statement said, according to IRNA. On Sunday, President Biden threw his support behind the demonstrators in the country, saying the US stands with the “brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.” In response, Iran said it will sue the US, alleging “direct involvement” in the protests.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter explains why journalists are being arrested for covering protest 02:45 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Voting machines\n\nTwo counties in the Western battleground states of Arizona and Nevada are moving forward with plans to hand count ballots in this year’s consequential midterm elections – a sign of the deep distrust of electronic vote tallying machines in some pockets of the country. Officials in the two communities still plan to use machines for the tallies, but experts worry the additional hand counts could result in two different totals and could further undermine public trust in elections. Critics also say hand counting thousands of ballots is not likely to produce accurate results. Meanwhile, local election workers are leaving their posts in droves due to continued threats and harassment as the November midterms draw closer. In some places, the exodus has opened the door to election deniers seeking roles in county elections offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Woman confronts armed man near ballot drop box 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n5. LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is rolling out new features to catch bots and fake accounts on its site. While often thought of as a tamer social platform for professionals and job seekers, LinkedIn is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated bad actors on the site. The professional networking company has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers for applying for high-profile job openings. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. The company told CNN Business this week that the new features will soon help users evaluate the authenticity of accounts before engaging with them.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nBaby beaver builds makeshift dam to keep her nemesis out\n\nA cute beaver is going viral for her gnaw-ledge on how to fend off enemies.

The former pilot for the Afghan Special Mission Wing – the elite of Afghanistan’s military – recently moved from Fort Pickett in Virginia to Chicago, where he has found a place to live and a roommate.\n\nHe is adjusting – slowly, he admits – to a new country. But everyone who would truly make America a place he could call home – his wife and four children, his two sisters and his mother – is still thousands of miles away, trapped in his native Kabul.\n\n“I am starting from zero to build up my life,” Khohestani told CNN, “but now I have a big issue and big problems in Afghanistan.”\n\nIn mid-August, he and other pilots from the Special Mission Wing flew their aircraft across the border to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in a desperate bid to keep some of the Afghan military’s most advanced equipment from falling into Taliban hands and thereby enabling their own de facto air force.\n\nMany fled the country without their families during the audacious move. They have waited for the US to evacuate their loved ones ever since.\n\n“All those families, they’re stuck in Kabul,” Khohestani told CNN.\n\nAn Afghan Special Mission Wing pilot hovers his helicopter during a training exercise. Courtesy Peter Quinn, President & CEO of Ark Salus and Army Veteran\n\nKhohestani, a colonel in the Special Mission Wing with more than 3,000 hours in Russian Mi-17 helicopters and 200 hours in Black Hawks, told his family to wait outside Kabul International Airport as the US and its allies evacuated thousands of Afghans in late August.\n\nBut the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate on August 26, which killed 13 US service members and scores of Afghans, dashed any hope Khohestani had of his family fleeing the country quickly. The flow of Afghans out of the country decreased dramatically in the final days of the evacuation, and the environment around the airport became a danger zone with a very real possibility of another attack.\n\nHe feels a sense of shame that he left his family behind.\n\n“Now everyone is moving around, changing houses, changing apartments,” Khohestani said. His wife and children have waited in Afghanistan ever since he left, afraid of the Taliban coming after them.\n\nAfter the military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan at the end of August, the State Department took over the efforts to bring out American allies and others.\n\nBut those evacuation flights, conducted by Qatar Airways and other foreign commercial airlines, have slowed to a trickle as the US works out what sort of diplomatic relationship it will have with the Taliban.\n\nCol. Belal Khohestani (right) sits in the back of helicopter, chatting with a member of the US military. Courtesy Peter Quinn, President & CEO of Ark Salus and Army Veteran\n\nState Department press secretary Ned Price said last week that the US effort to evacuate Afghans at risk, as well as American citizens and green card holders, is ongoing.\n\n“We have continued as well to do what we can to support Afghans to whom we have a special commitment, and that includes those who fall within the category of the [Special Immigrant Visas],” said Price. “We are looking at alternatives to processing for the larger cohort within this category knowing that, even though our presence on the ground in Afghanistan is no more, we are doing what we can from other posts and looking at creative solutions to continue our efforts to safely relocate those individuals who wish to depart the country.”\n\nDespite the Taliban’s promises of amnesty, Khohestani fears retribution against his loved ones.\n\nA Human Rights Watch report released in late November alleges the Taliban executed dozens of members of the Afghan security forces after they surrendered. The report focuses on a few provinces across the country, but Human Rights Watch says the 47 cases it examined “reflect a broader pattern of abuses” throughout Afghanistan.\n\nResearchers at the organization said the Taliban “have also targeted family members of former security force members.”\n\nThe Taliban’s deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi rejected the report while acknowledging that “some former forces were harmed.”\n\nDrew Horn (left, standing) speaks with members of the Afghan military.

It was the entire SMW. They protected me and safeguarded us on a daily basis.”\n\nQuinn has worked to get visas for the families of Khohestani and other Afghan military pilots to leave Afghanistan, through Pakistan, India and other locations so they can begin making their way to the United States. The process is not easy, with no direct flights and a screening and vetting process for each Afghan refugee.\n\nQuinn is undeterred.\n\n“These guys are heroes,” said Quinn. “They need to be welcomed warmly.”\n\n“We were counterparts. We were doing the missions together,” said Hashmatullah Ahmadzai, also a helicopter pilot with the Afghan Special Mission Wing. “SMW was kind of part of the US armed forces.”\n\nAhmadzai hasn’t seen his wife and son in more than four months.\n\nThe hardest time was right after he arrived in Uzbekistan, he said, because the authorities there took his cell phone. He would wait hours for a three-minute call with his family. Now living in California, he is thousands of miles farther away, but he can communicate with them on messaging services.\n\nFor their own safety, Ahmadzai said his family is constantly on the move. His father and brothers were also in the Afghan military fighting the Taliban, which he fears makes them a target for retribution.\n\n“We lost everything. Our job, our house, our money. We start here from zero,” Ahmadzai said.\n\n“The United States is a good country, a good economy, good work, but it still takes time to make your life better.”\n\nA better life for the Special Mission Wing pilots begins with a family reunion, but they must contend with two uncertain futures – their own in a new country and the future of their families in a country to which they can no longer return.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}]}

And they feel the government is not doing enough to fight inflation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden can point to a booming jobs market as evidence of a strong recovery, but he can also expect to face tough questions at Wednesday’s press conference about the economic problems that are making voters anxious right now. Here are a few that could come up:\n\n1.) In December, Biden suggested inflation had peaked — but since then, consumer prices have accelerated to fresh 39-year highs. When can the American people realistically expect inflation to get back to normal levels?\n\nThe high cost of living is the biggest problem in today’s economy. Prices of everything from new cars to full-service meals rose at the fastest pace on record in December.\n\nIn just the past few days, for example, Peloton (PTON) and Netflix (NFLX) have raised prices and orange juice futures have climbed to three-year highs amid the weakest Florida harvest since World War II.\n\nHigh inflation is largely a consequence of Covid. Demand has surged as the economy recovers from the pandemic, but supply simply can’t keep up — in part because of Covid-related supply bottlenecks.\n\n2.) The worker shortage is contributing to the high cost of living. Beyond Build Back Better, what additional plans does the Biden administration have to fill vacant jobs? What about ramping up immigration?\n\nThe Build Back Better Act could have helped address the worker shortage by making childcare more affordable. That may have encouraged moms and dads to get into — or back into — the workforce.\n\nBut Biden’s signature legislation is very much in doubt and the worker shortage persists.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce has called for doubling the number of legal immigrants coming into America, arguing this be the No. 1 thing the government can do to fight inflation. But it’s not clear there is any appetite in Congress right now for immigration reform.\n\n3.) Not even two months after Biden tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, oil prices climbed to fresh seven-year highs. Doesn’t that show that the SPR wasn’t a real solution? What steps is the administration considering to contain gas prices now?\n\nBiden announced the biggest-ever release of barrels from the SPR just before Thanksgiving. Oil prices have fully recovered their losses.\n\nPrices at the pump now are ticking higher, rising to $3.32 a gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA. That’s just 10 cents shy of the seven-year high set last fall.\n\nThe White House has said Biden still has tools to address pump prices. But what are those tools, and under what circumstances does the president intend to use them?\n\nRising geopolitical tensions have been driving up crude prices in recent days. The potential of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, which the White House has warned might happen at any moment, could send prices much higher. It isn’t clear what, if any, contingency plans the Biden administration is making to cushion an oil shock triggered by a clash between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n4.) By many metrics, supply chains remain severely stressed. What is the administration’s plan to unclog them and ensure grocery store shelves remain stocked?\n\nThere have been glimmers of hope on the supply chain front, and yet the situation remains very challenging. That’s keeping pressure on prices.\n\nPeloton cited supply chain problems behind its decision to jack up prices. So did companies like Ikea and Procter & Gamble. And grocery stores have struggled to keep shelves stocked due to a variety of factors, including supply chains, Omicron and bad weather.\n\nIn a research report earlier this month, Goldman Sachs said its congestion tracker remains at a level of 10 out of 10, indicating “fully bottlenecked” supply chains. Bank of America said logistics bottlenecks are “showing no signs of easing with US port congestion near record highs and North Europe hitting new highs.”\n\n5.) The Federal Reserve plans to hike interest rates and end its bond buying stimulus program. Does the administration support the Fed’s plans? Is there concern these moves might slow the economy or roil financial markets?\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Biden tapped for another four-year term leading the central bank, has signaled growing concern about inflation. After months of keeping its foot on the easy money pedal, the Powell-led Fed is finally planning to tap the brakes to cool off inflation and investors have gotten nervous about the impact of the Fed withdrawing support. And there are risks that if the Fed moves too quickly, it might hurt the recovery in the process.\n\nBiden, who has frequently said he respects the independence of the central bank, may not want to weigh in directly on Fed policy.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nBritain’s Conservative Party, which has weathered the resignation of two prime ministers since December 2019, cannot remain in government for another two years without calling a general election.\n\nWell, technically, they could. But that doesn’t mean they should.\n\nLaura Beers Laura Beers\n\nUnder British law, as long as a party can command a parliamentary majority, it can continue in power for up to five years before calling an election.\n\nAnd the Conservative Party, despite having suffered a series of recent by-election defeats, still maintains a working parliamentary majority of 71, meaning that Britain’s next general election could conceivably come as late as January 2025.\n\nOn Monday, Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson’s former finance minister, won the contest to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister of Britain. Johnson himself had seriously considered challenging Sunak to regain the premiership, before announcing Sunday evening that he would not stand in the leadership race.\n\nSince the announcement of Liz Truss’s resignation on Thursday, Conservative MPs have been citing the letter of the law to defend the party’s seeming determination to remain in power, despite the insistence of opposition parties and even some Tories that a general election is now a moral, if not a legal, imperative.\n\nBut as any three-year-old knows, there are two meanings of “You can’t do that!” On the one hand, there is “You can’t do that because it is actually impossible.” There is also, “You can’t do that because it is unconscionable.” When one of my sons clocks the other one on the head and I shout, “You can’t do that!” both boys understand my meaning.\n\nChanging leaders twice in the course of a parliamentary term without consulting the British electorate is the political equivalent of whacking your brother just because he annoyed you. You just can’t do it and expect to get away with it. This is especially true when, as in the current political moment, there have been dramatic reversals of party policy since the previous general election.\n\nBritain is facing inflation, rising borrowing costs and predicted deficits on a massive scale which will likely require either significant tax increases, spending cuts or both.\n\nThe policy decisions taken in the next few months will have implications for years to come. There is a political imperative for Britons to be given a say as to how their leaders should tackle the current crisis. By ignoring that imperative, the Tory party would risk further eroding faith in Britain’s democratic process, at a time when democracy is under significant threat around the globe.\n\nThere is a political imperative for Britons to be given a say as to how their leaders should tackle the current crisis. Laura Beers\n\nIn the current situation, it is untenable to argue that the mandate which the public gave to Boris Johnson and the 2019 Conservative election manifesto still holds. This is true despite the fact that Sunak, the new party leader, served in Johnson’s administration.\n\nIt would have to be true even if Johnson had returned as prime minister – an incredible political reincarnation which Johnson seriously considered attempting before announcing on Sunday that he would not stand for the leadership despite the “very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative Party members.”\n\nEven before Truss announced her resignation, Britain’s opposition parties have been calling for a general election in the wake of her disastrous “mini-budget,” the series of policy U-turns that followed and her decision to sack her newly appointed chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\nFollowing Truss’s resignation announcement, Labour leader Keir Starmer reiterated those calls, emphasizing that the British people had a right to weigh in on the question of who should lead the country.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people. They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish,” Starmer said.\n\nLikewise Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, asserted that there was now a “democratic imperative” to hold a general election, and the Liberal Party leader Ed Davey, insisted that the Conservatives had a “patriotic duty” to “give the people a say” about the future direction of the country.\n\nThat Britain’s opposition parties are clamoring for an election is unsurprising. The latest opinion polling shows Labour up over 30 points on the Tories, the party’s largest poll lead in history. If an election were called in the next few months, Labour would almost certainly win a comfortable majority.\n\nBut the conviction that “the British public deserve a proper say on the country’s future,” extends beyond the opposition ranks. A YouGov poll conducted Thursday found that nearly two-thirds of Britons believed that Truss’s replacement should call an early general election.\n\nIn asserting the imperative for an early general election after two changes of leadership, the opposition parties have history on their side. British political parties have frequently made a single change of prime minister without calling an early election.\n\nGordon Brown replaced Tony Blair in June 2007 and did not hold an election for nearly three years. John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 and did not call an election for another year and a half. Similar to Brown, Jim Callaghan, who succeeded Harold Wilson, lasted nearly three years without an election.\n\nBut in each of these cases, the men who took over had been long-serving and high-ranking members of their predecessors’ administrations, and (with the exception of Major’s abandonment of the highly unpopular poll tax) largely continued the policy program on which their predecessor had been elected.\n\nIn that sense, their ascension to the premiership was more akin to the elevation of a vice president after the death of a president in the United States – a significant change in government, but one accepted to be within the bounds of democratic legitimacy.\n\nIn contrast, the only prime minister in the modern era to govern without seeking a new electoral mandate after two changes in leadership was Winston Churchill, whose wartime coalition government had the united support of all parties in the House of Commons and the clear backing of the British public.\n\nBefore Churchill, we need to look back to 1828, when the Duke of Wellington succeeded the Viscount Goderich, who in turn had succeeded George Canning (who died in office after 119 days and who held the title of shortest serving prime minister for nearly two hundred years, until Liz Truss came along.)\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe Tory Wellington remained in office for a year and a half without calling a general election. But Britain in 1828 was not a true democracy. Fewer than 10% of adult males could vote, and several MPs represented “rotten boroughs” which were effectively controlled by a handful of wealthy families. The notion of democratic accountability simply did not exist in the way that it does now.\n\nToday, in the 21st century, with universal adult suffrage, Starmer is right that the Tories cannot treat Britain as their personal fiefdom. After all that has happened since Johnson’s resignation in July, they must seek a fresh mandate to remain in power.\n\nAfter all the chaos and dysfunction, the British people deserve a say over who governs the country.", "authors": ["Laura Beers"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-liz-truss-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Liz Truss wins Conservative Party ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series of scandals.\n\nTruss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.\n\nShe pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/uk/boris-johnson-replacement-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Conservative leadership race: Who might replace Boris Johnson as ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe race to replace British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ramping up, with 11 candidates declaring their intention to run, many on platforms of lowering taxes and promises to clean up government following Johnson’s crisis-plagued leadership.\n\nSir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative party backbenchers announced on Monday that a new leader would be announced on September 5, the same day that the British parliament returns from its summer recess. He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/20/liz-truss-british-prime-minister-resigns/10494916002/", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as UK prime minister after 45 days in office", "text": "LONDON – Liz Truss became the shortest-serving leader in British political history after she resigned Thursday less than two months into the job.\n\nHer announcement came after her attempt to roll out aggressive tax cuts aimed at spurring economic growth but instead dramatically roiled financial markets, led to unprecedented central bank intervention and drove her poll ratings to the lowest ever recorded for a prime minister.\n\nTruss, 47, lasted 45 days in office. Because Britain elects a party, not a specific leader, she will be replaced by another lawmaker from her ruling Conservative Party. The process to replace Truss will take place within the next week.\n\nTruss will remain as prime minister until then.\n\n\"I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability,\" Truss said in in a brief statement outside No. 10 Downing Street in London. \"I recognize, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate to which I was elected by the Conservative Party.\"\n\nThe previous shortest tenure for a British leader was held by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served for one year and one day, from 1963 to 1964.\n\nWhy did Liz Truss resign? The move follows weeks of turmoil\n\nTruss's resignation comes after several weeks of political chaos during which she abandoned most of her economic policies.\n\nTruss fired Kwasi Kwarteng, her close ally and finance minister, on Oct. 14, even though he was implementing the pro-growth agenda she campaigned on.\n\nKwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, a former foreign minister who was beaten to the prime minister job by Boris Johnson in 2019. Hunt also failed to make a runoff in the Conservative Party process that selected Truss.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LIZ TRUSS: She models herself on Margaret Thatcher\n\nSince she took over, multiple polls have shown that the opposition Labor Party would likely win a landslide victory in a general election. Under British political rules, the Conservative Party must call an election before January 2025.\n\nWho could be the next prime minister?\n\nFives names have already bubbled up:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nSunak is the front-runner, according to betting markets and news reports. Sunak, 42, lost out to Truss when she became prime minister on Sept. 6. Sunak was Johnson's finance minister. Before embarking on a career in politics, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and at a hedge fund. He met his wife, the daughter of the co-founder of Infosys, one of India's largest technology companies, while studying for an MBA at Stanford University. The couple have an estimated wealth of $1 billion, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual gauge of the 1,000 wealthiest people and families in the U.K. Sunak served in Johnson's Cabinet as finance minister.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nMordaunt, 49, leader of the House of Commons, was once regarded as the most likely lawmaker to succeed Johnson. She has been a member of Parliament since 2010 and served as trade minister. She also had a stint as minister for local government and was the first woman named armed forces minister. Mordaunt was one of the leaders behind the “Brexit” referendum approved by voters in 2016, which led to Britain's separation from the EU. She is a reservist in the Royal Navy.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nHunt, 55, is another longtime Cabinet minister with leadership ambitions. He appears to have already ruled himself out for prime minister, but a week has become a long time in British politics lately, so he could find a way to reassert himself in the contest. Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, described Hunt as the \"Mitt Romney of British politics\" in 2019, a reference to the Utah senator known for his professionalism and lack of political charisma.\n\nBen Wallace\n\nWallace, 52, is Britain's defense secretary and has won plaudits at home and abroad for his strong support for Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Wallace supported Truss when she ran for prime minister, which could work against him.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nJohnson, 58, left office himself only on Sept. 6, but his name has never been far from the headlines as a possible candidate for a comeback. Johnson is still well liked by Conservative Party members even though he resigned after a series of scandals connected to coronavirus lockdowns. Johnson has been silent on whether he'd take the job again. The Times (of London) is reporting Johnson is considering running in the contest.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSir Graham Brady , leader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday.\n\nleader of the 1922 committee, a group of influential Conservative Party lawmakers who determine party rules, said he expects a new prime minister to be announced by Oct. 28. Truss was selected by ordinary Conservative Party grassroots members, about 81,000 of them. Brady announced late Thursday that to enter the race to be the next party leader and thus prime minister, candidates need to secure the backing of 100 lawmakers by Monday. Because there are 357 Conservative parliamentarians, this means a maximum of three lawmakers will be on the short list. If three make the list, lawmakers will vote on those, and the candidate with the least support will be eliminated. If a second vote is needed, lawmakers will then be able to signal whom they prefer in what is called an \"indicative vote.\" If both candidates choose to stay in the contest after this second round, then the final decision will be made again by the 81,000 grassroots members of the party who elected Truss.\n\nOpposition Labor Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate general election, a scenario that seems unlikely give that the ruling Conservative Party, according to polls, would almost certainly lose any such vote.\n\nWhat are they saying?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/gallery/rishi-sunak/index.html", "title": "Photos: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak | CNN", "text": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.\n\nRishi Sunak is the United Kingdom's latest prime minister, replacing Liz Truss — the country's shortest-serving leader of all time.\n\nSunak is the first Hindu and the first person of color to lead the UK.

Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/25/sunak-britains-next-pm-st-louis-school-shooting-5-things-podcast/10594856002/", "title": "Rishi Sunak to be Britain's first PM of color, latest school shooting: 5 ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Rishi Sunak to become Britain's first prime minister of color\n\nHear what he plans for the country.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 25th of October 2022. Today, a look at Britain's next Prime Minister. Plus, election debate season rolls on and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nJustice Department officials have unsealed charges against 13 Chinese operatives in three so-called influence campaigns. One involves two intelligence officers accused in an attempt to obstruct a federal criminal investigation into the Chinese telecommunication's company, Huawei. The Supreme Court has temporarily paused the subpoena battle surrounding Senator Lindsey Graham in Georgia. It surrounds his involvement in the State following the 2020 election. And Leslie Jordan has died. The comedian and actor was best known for television roles on Hearts Afire and Will & Grace. And became a social media sensation in recent years. He was 67.\n\n♦\n\nBritain is set for yet another prime minister change. Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak was selected by the country's ruling Conservative Party just seven weeks after he was beaten to the office by Liz Truss. She resigned last week amid economic turmoil in the country. Sunak will be the fifth British prime minister in just six years and the third in less than two months after Truss and Boris Johnson. He's the country's first leader of South Asian descent, its first Hindu Prime Minister, and the nation's first leader of color. He's also the youngest prime minister in modern history.\n\nSunak takes over with Britain in the middle of challenging economic times. Forecasters suggest its economy has already fallen into recession and the country is being hit with some of the highest energy and borrowing costs in Europe. Borrowing costs were made worse by Liz Truss as predecessors moved to aggressively cut taxes. Annual inflation in the country hit 10.1% in September, a 40-year high.\n\nSunak is a former banker and finance minister under Boris Johnson's government. He focused on the economy during a speech yesterday.\n\nRishi Sunak:\n\nWe face a profound economic challenge. We now need stability and unity. And I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together because that is the only way we will overcome the challenges we face and build a better more prosperous future for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSunak quickly rose up the political ladder after a privileged upbringing and lucrative marriage. His wife is the daughter of the founder of one of India's largest technology companies and they have an estimated wealth of a billion dollars. Sunak has spoken often about his Indian roots and as a practicing Hindu. He said lighting candles to mark the religious festival Diwali outside the official Downing Street residents was one of the proudest moments of his career.\n\n♦\n\nFlorida's candidates for governor hit the debate stage last night. Republican governor Ron DeSantis and Democrat Charlie Crist went at it, and it was Crist on the offensive He trails DeSantis in both polling and spending. Crist hit on abortion in his opening statement saying, \"You're going to hear a stark contrast in this debate and this election. It's a stark contrast between somebody who believes in a woman's right to choose. I think that's fundamentally important, and Governor DeSantis has signed a bill that would restrict that right, even in cases of rape or incest.\" DeSantis weaved around abortion at times but did defend the law he signed, banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAnother focus for Crist was on whether DeSantis will commit to a full term as governor, saying he's committed to run for president in 2024.\n\nCharlie Crist:\n\nYou talk about Joe Biden a lot. I understand you think you're going to be running against him. I can see how you might get confused, but you're running for governor, you're running for governor, and I have a question for you. You're running for governor, why don't you look in the eyes of the people of the State of Florida and say to them if you're reelected, you will serve a full four-year term as governor? Yes or no? Yes or no, Ron? Will you serve a full four-year term if you're reelected governor of Florida? It's not a tough question. It's a fair question. He won't tell you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs for DeSantis, he repeatedly worked to link his Democratic opponent with President Joe Biden.\n\nRon DeSantis:\n\nWell, listen I know that Charlie's interested in talking about 2024 and Joe Biden, but I just want to make things very, very clear, the only worn-out old donkey I'm looking to put out the pasture is Charlie Crist.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHe specifically referenced inflation saying \"It's much more expensive to replace a roof today than just three years ago, thanks to the Biden/Crist policies that unfortunately is contributing to the increase.\"\n\nAnd the pair clashed on immigration, Governor DeSantis spent $1.5 million in Florida taxpayer money last month to fly asylum seekers from Texas to Massachusetts. Crist called that a political stunt. The move has drawn an investigation into possible human trafficking by DeSantis. And he's being sued by a Florida State Senator for misusing state funds. Still, he said he had no regrets.\n\n♦\n\nAs for the Senate race in Pennsylvania, the first and only debate is taking place tonight between Republican Mehmet Oz, and Democrat John Fetterman. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with reporter Bethany Rogers to find out why only one was scheduled and what we can expect to see tonight.\n\nBethany Rogers:\n\nDemocrat John Fetterman has been recovering from a stroke that almost killed him back in May. And he's kind of had a gradual return to the campaign trail. So this was the only debate that they actually ended up getting scheduled despite the Republican candidate Mehmet Oz pushing for more time and for more events like this.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo The Wall Street Journal reported that immigration is becoming a key component in this race. Why is that?\n\nBethany Rogers:\n\nI think that Oz has tried to focus on it. I think nationally Republicans go to immigration as sort of an issue because polling has shown that it advantages their candidates when that becomes a focus of the race or an issue that voters are making decisions on. Oz has really tried to tie questions on immigration to problems of drugs and crime coming across the border.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nBethany, aside from the battle for control in the Senate, what else is at stake in this race and the future of elections in Pennsylvania?\n\nBethany Rogers:\n\nI think that some of the issues around male and voting and what former President Trump does in response to the results in Pennsylvania could be very telling. There's been some reporting saying that he's going to try to use this midterm kind of as a test case for 2024 and see if he could kind of contest some of the results here if they don't really go the way that Republicans want them to.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTwo people were killed and seven injured after a former student opened fire at a high school in St. Louis yesterday. The 19-year-old gunman shot and killed a 61-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School according to police. They also said the attacker graduated from the school last year and had no criminal history. He had almost a dozen 30-round high-capacity magazines on him and was killed by police at the scene. St. Louis Police Commissioner Mike Sack said the day's trauma will affect an entire community.\n\nMike Sack:\n\nNow, this is a heartbreaking day for all of us. It's going to be tough. While on paper we might have nine victims, eight were transported and one remained. We have hundreds of others. Everyone who survived here is going to take home trauma.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe seven injured were all stable. Police said they included male and female students aged 15 and 16 with injuries including shrapnel and gunshot wounds. It's still not clear how the gunman was able to enter a locked school. The shooting is the 257th incident of gunfire on school grounds this calendar year, according to the K-12 school shooting database. And there have been at least 39 school shootings this year that led to injuries or deaths, according to Education Week. That's the most in a single year since the outlet began tracking such incidents in 2018.\n\nWith yet another American shooting we wanted to use this morning to consider how we cover gun violence across the country. The Columbia Journalism Review held a summit last year on how to improve coverage of gun violence. Kyle Pope is the editor-in-chief and publisher of the Review. He says they found it's important to cover gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nKyle Pope:\n\nGun violence is a sort of daily public health crisis in America that tends largely to go uncovered until one of these high-profile events comes up. And we're not saying that these things don't deserve coverage. We're saying that we're living in a kind of pandemic of gun violence and that it deserves daily sustained attention that it's not getting. More than a hundred people die in America every day from gun violence. And it is a health crisis and it affects disproportionately marginal communities and communities of color. And we think it needs to be framed that way and it's just not. And the sad fact is that there's not a community in America that's unaffected by this.\n\nWe're not arguing that this isn't a terrible thing that happened or that it doesn't deserve coverage. All we're arguing is that this is happening every single day, literally without fail in the country. And that all those other people who are being victimized and all those other communities that are being sort of attacked by this deserve attention from the press as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find more of Kyle on Twitter @kylepope.\n\n♦\n\nThere's some good economic news as wages are rising on average, but that could also bring bad news. PJ Elliott spoke with money reporter, Medora Lee to find out why.\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nThere are different measures of wages, but one of the ones that a lot of people look at is Employment Cost Index, and that rose 5.1% in the second quarter annually. That's below the inflation rate, but it was the fastest pace since the series began in first quarter 2002.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nMedora, you wrote that this is a good thing for workers but not so much for inflation. Can you go more into that?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nWorkers will demand more higher wages because they realize that their money's not going as far as they had hoped, and so they'll ask for more money. And so the companies will give them higher pay, but they have to pass that cost through, so they'll charge higher prices for that. And so this is what they call the wage-price spiral.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what if anything can be done to stop the wage spiral?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nWe have to get inflation down. And to do this, the Fed doesn't really doesn't have very many tools. It has to raise interest rates.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nHow high would rates have to go for things to stabilize?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSome top economists like former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and then some of the economists at Deutsche Bank, think that the Fed funds rate has to probably move to at least 5%, maybe even higher. It just depends on whether we have any more shocks that could push inflation higher.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us seven mornings a week right here, wherever you're listening right now. Thanks to PJ Elliott for his great work on the show, and I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/india/rishi-sunak-india-british-ties-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What do Indians think about Rishi Sunak's rise?

But 75 years since the end of the British Raj, many Indian commentators gleefully pointed out how times have changed.\n\n“Indian son rises over the empire. History comes full circle in Britain,” an NDTV headline said.\n\n“From Age of Empire to Rishi Raj as Sunak moves into No 10,” thundered The Times Of India.\n\n“India was [once] under the governance of Britain. Now, an Indian-origin man has become the Prime Minister of England,” a Zee News anchor said.\n\nOthers were more blunt about what they saw as the symbolism behind Sunak’s appointment, news of which emerged on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\n“Another Diwali gift to the country.

Aaron Chown/AP Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nWhen he took his parliamentary oath in 2019, Sunak clutched the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. He made history a year later when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nNow he is at the pinnacle of power – and that, analysts say, is the epitome of the diaspora’s success.\n\nPant, from the Observer Research Foundation, said Sunak’s appointment symbolizes how people of South Asian descent have “cut across political parties in the UK,” adding Sunak “will shape the political trajectory” of Britain.\n\n“I think there is a certain comfort level that people of the Indian diaspora have in these democracies,” Pant said. “And that is reflective of the largest success of India globally.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/uk/rishi-sunak-sajid-javid-resignation-boris-johnson-intl/index.html", "title": "Huge blow for Boris Johnson as senior UK government ministers ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt a huge and sudden blow on Tuesday when two of his top ministers announced their resignations, saying they could no longer work for a government mired in scandal.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced their decisions to quit within minutes of each other on Tuesday evening, plunging Johnson’s troubled administration into renewed chaos and prompting a wave of other junior ministers and officials to resign.\n\nSome called on Johnson himself to step down, and there was speculation that if he refused to go, members of his own party would launch a formal effort to unseat him – less than a month after the last one failed.\n\nThe immediate cause of the resignations was the bungled handling of a recent controversy, but came against the backdrop of months of turmoil in which Johnson was fined by police for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules.\n\n“The public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously,” Sunak said in his resignation letter, posted to Twitter. “I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.”\n\n“I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this,” Sunak added.\n\nJavid wrote that “it has been an enormous privilege to serve in this role, but I regret that I can no longer continue in good conscience.” Javid added that the vote of confidence in the prime minister last month “was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.”\n\n“I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too,” Javid wrote.\n\nOther ministers and officials occupying more junior posts in the government quit in the hours that followed, with more resignations continuing on Wednesday morning. Johnson moved to shore up his position, replacing his two Cabinet ministers late on Tuesday.\n\nScandal after scandal\n\nThe latest crisis blew up out of Downing Street’s handling of last week’s resignation of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, who stepped down from his post last Thursday amid allegations he had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before.\n\nWhile he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nDowning Street had struggled to explain why Pincher was in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations about his previous alleged conduct, denying Johnson knew anything specific about the allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that a complaint had been made against Pincher in the Foreign Office about three years ago and that Johnson was briefed on what happened.\n\nMinutes before Sunak and Javid announced their resignations, Johnson acknowledged it “was a mistake” to appoint Pincher to his government.\n\n“I got this complaint. It was something that was only raised with me very cursory, but I wish that we had acted on it and that he had not continued in government because he then went on, I’m afraid, to behave, as far as we can see – according to the allegations that we have – very, very badly,” Johnson said in a broadcast interview.\n\nUK opposition leader Keir Starmer said it was “clear” that the government was “collapsing.”\n\n“Tory cabinet ministers have known all along who this Prime Minister is. They have been his cheerleaders throughout this sorry saga. Backing him when he broke the law. Backing him when he lied repeatedly. Backing him when he mocked the sacrifices of the British people,” the Labour Party leader said in a statement released after the two resignations.\n\nFor months Johnson has been facing a barrage of criticism over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson has faced numerous other scandals that have hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide victory just two-and-a-half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping MPs to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nBut while he managed to win the confidence vote, he suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nAccording to an Ipsos UK survey conducted between 22 and 29 June, Johnson’s Conservative Party, by some measures, is at its lowest level recorded in more than a decade. Just 21% of respondents said it is “fit to govern” – the lowest number for either the Conservatives or Labour since Ipsos started tracking this metric in 2011.\n\nThe chaos in Westminster had ripple effects in the financial markets, pushing the value of the British pound against the dollar to its lowest in more than two years.\n\nMore resignations\n\nDowning Street did not hesitate filling the vacant roles. Nadhim Zahawi, who was previously Secretary of State for Education, was appointed as Chancellor, while Downing Street Chief of Staff Steve Barclay became the new Health Secretary. Michelle Donelan replaced Zahawi as Education Secretary.\n\nThe resignation of the two Cabinet ministers prompted more junior figures to follow. Conservative party vice chair Bim Afolami announced his decision to quit live on television. During an interview with Tom Newton Dunn on Talk TV, Afolami said: “I just don’t think the Prime Minister any longer has my support… the support of the party or indeed the country anymore.”\n\nAlex Chalk, who served as the Solicitor General for Englnad and Wales, one of the government’s most senior law officers, also quit, saying in his resignation letter that it was time “for fresh leadership.”\n\n“To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible,” Chalk said.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Morocco, Andrew Murrison, also stepped down, blasting the “rolling chaos of the last six months” and saying that Boris Johnson’s “position has become unrecoverable.”\n\nAt least half a dozen other junior-ranking government officials also announced resignations later on Tuesday, and more quit on Wednesday morning.\n\nAllies of the Prime Minister insisted he would fight on. But, adding to the sense of chaos, two more ministers resigned just as Zahawi was giving an interview to BBC Radio 4’s Today program, regarded as the most high-profile of morning broadcast shows. As Zahawi responded to being told of the first resignation, the presenter, Nick Robinson, interrupted him to tell him of another.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Houston then failed to score with runners on second and third to end the game.\n\nThe Astros first jumped out to a 5-0 lead by the bottom of the 3rd inning, with four runs scored off a pair of blasts hit by Kyle Tucker in his first two at-bats.

He quickly ascended through the Mets' minor league system, ultimately making his major-league debut in 2013 and immediately showing promise, pitching to a 3.50 ERA with 271 strikeouts in 285.1 innings in 49 starts across his first two seasons.\n\nWheeler underwent Tommy John elbow surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing elbow that he suffered during spring training in 2015.

Now comes the conundrum with deGrom.\n\nOver the past two seasons, while battling back, side, forearm and shoulder injuries, deGrom has only combined to pitch 156.1 innings. When he is on the field, deGrom is one of the most dynamic pitchers in the game. He has picked up a pair of Cy Young awards and has a lifetime ERA of 2.52 with a sub-1.00 WHIP.\n\nBut deGrom has not pitched more than 200 innings since 2019, and he'll be looking for a contract to rival the record $43.3 million-per-year deal inked by teammate Max Scherzer last offseason.\n\nThere is bound to be suitors for arguably the best pitcher to ever take the mound at Citi Field.

But the Astros evened things up in a hurry as two of their most indispensable players recovered from their own foibles.\n\nFor Altuve, October heroics are expected.

And a pattern was quickly established.\n\nNo. 2 hitter Jeremy Peña: First-pitch curveball, RBI double.\n\nNo. 3 hitter Yordan Alvarez: First-pitch fastball fouled off, followed by another swing on a slider, knocking it the opposite way off the left field wall for another RBI double.\n\nIt was the first time in World Series history a team started a game with three consecutive extra-base hits.\n\nAnd for the Astros, seeing the old Altuve back was almost as big a relief as squaring the series. He added singles in the fifth and seventh, the latter coming on a swing at a ball practically over his head.\n\n\"Early in the playoffs I was swinging at everything and then getting slowly better at swinging at my pitch,\" says Altuve. \"And yeah, I got a hit on a pitch almost above my head today.\n\n\"But it's a hit, so it's good.\"\n\nSays manager Dusty Baker of an Altuve breakout: \"If I say it every day, it's got to happen one of these days. You know just how I feel about Altuve. His track record speaks for itself. I mean, he swung the bat great today. Boy, it was great to see. All the guys on the team were extremely happy for him.\n\n\"Hopefully he can continue and start to roll the way Altuve can roll.\"\n\nWheeler entered Game 2 with a 1.78 ERA and 25 strikeouts in 25 ⅓ innings this postseason, very much the playoff ace the Phillies hoped for. But the Astros never let him get comfortable. And in Game 2, Valdez would not yield the 5-0 lead he eventually received, as Game 1 starter Justin Verlander did the night before.\n\nNo, this is a new Valdez.\n\nThe old one was probably the player most culpable for Houston’s six-game loss to Atlanta in the 2021 World Series. Valdez started Games 1 and 5 and was terrible: A 19.29 ERA thanks to 10 earned runs in 4 ⅔ innings, four home runs allowed, a Game 1 loss and a gracious bailout by his teammates for a Game 5 no-decision.\n\nBut Valdez went to work on his focus and his repertoire, consulting a sports psychologist to keep him on point during games and adding a cut fastball to complement a 95-mph sinking fastball and curveball.\n\nOh, that curveball. It was particularly biting Saturday night.\n\nThrough five shutout innings, nine of Valdez’s 13 swings and misses came on his curve. It was particularly nasty on a fourth-inning strikeout of Phillies slugger Bryce Harper, during which Valdez showed him his cutter, a trio of 95-mph sinkers and finally a huge breaking ball that had Harper flailing.\n\nTwo innings later, his pitch count in the 90s, Valdez encountered Harper again, this time with two on. But Harper skidded a fastball right at Altuve, who initiated a 4-6-3 double play.\n\nBy then, Bregman’s third home run this postseason, a two-run shot that was also the sixth World Series homer of his career, staked Valdez to a 5-0 advantage.\n\nHe finished with nine strikeouts in 6⅓ innings, an inherited earned run scored. It nearly duplicated his seven-inning, nine-strikeout, no earned run effort in Game 2 of the ALCS.\n\nThis Game 2 was a decidedly different outcome than his two stumbles against Atlanta one year ago. And this one came while pitching in front of his father, who overcame a fear of flying to make it to Houston from the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"Definitely last year my emotions got the best of me,\" Valdez said after his sixth career postseason victory and second in as many starts, after striking out nine Yankees in seven innings of ALCS Game 2. \"I wasn't able to throw even more than two innings without giving up a run. But those were things that I was able to learn, separate my emotions from my job being on the field. Whenever I'm on the field, on the mound, I just keep my emotions outside of the field, try to stay calm, collected.\n\n\"To have my dad here gives me a little bit of extra strength, and especially he's just used to seeing me pitch on TV, seeing guys like Altuve, Bregman, Peña on TV. Now he's able to see them in person. It means a lot. And, yeah, it means the world to me that he's here, that they're both here.\"\n\nStill just 28 and with less than four years of service time, the Astros have witnessed Valdez come of age firsthand.\n\n\"I think it's his focus and his self-confidence,\" says Bregman. \"I think he's confident in himself, he attacks, he knows that he's got good stuff. I think he has a lot of confidence in (catcher) Martín (Maldonado) and the pitches that he's calling.\"\n\nThe Astros didn’t need Altuve to progress, just rediscover his old self. His three hits in Game 2 give him 99 in the postseason, moving past Kenny Lofton, Chipper Jones and Albert Pujols to rank sixth all-time. Alvarez, meanwhile, doubled and walked after coming in on a 3-for-25, 10-strikeout skid.\n\nIf both are back, as the Astros know them, than a club that’s now 8-1 this postseason once again looks very dangerous as the Series shifts to Philly for Monday’s Game 3.\n\nPhiladelphia closed out the defending champion Braves in the NLDS and the San Diego Padres in the NLCS by winning five games at home. Theoretically, the Phillies could do the same to Houston next week.\n\n\"Obviously, we’d like to go back home up 2-0,\" says first baseman Rhys Hoskins, \"but if you told us before the series started that we’d be able to steal a game here and have a win under our belt, guaranteeing three games at home, I think everybody would be pretty ecstatic tonight.\n\n\"We’ve been here before.\"\n\nSo, too, have the Astros.

LOUIS (AP) — More than a decade ago, the talented triumvirate of Albert Pujols, Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright helped power the St. Louis Cardinals past the Philadelphia Phillies in the divisional round of the playoffs, and ultimately to a World Series title.\n\nA lot has happened since, and not a lot of it good around Philadelphia, where the Phillies have had more losing seasons than winning ones and secured a wild-card spot earlier this week for their first return to the postseason.\n\nThe two clubs will meet again, 11 years after their last thrilling playoff showdown, set to play a best-of-three National League wild-card series at Busch Stadium. And wouldn't you know it? Pujols, Molina and Wainwright are still around, and each could have a starring role when the series begins Friday afternoon.\n\n“I've thought about it a lot, right? It literally became like a fork in the road — one went right, one went left,” John Mozeliak, the Cardinals' president of baseball operations, said Thursday in recalling the decisive Game 5 of the 2011 series. St. Louis won 1-0 behind Chris Carpenter's three-hit gem against Hall of Famer Roy Halladay.\n\n“It was such an epic game, probably one of the greatest games any of us got to watch,” Mozeliak said. “For us it became more of a springboard, and in the Phillies' case, it became a turning point for their franchise, too.\"\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nThe Cardinals continued to challenge for championships over the next decade, losing three times in the NL Championship Series and once in the World Series.\n\nThe team they're taking into this postseason might be the best one yet: Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt will be getting plenty of MVP votes. The starting rotation, buoyed by the trade-deadline arrival of Game 1 starter Jose Quintana, has been solid. And the bullpen has been among the best in baseball.\n\nMolina will be back behind the plate, Wainwright is available out of the bullpen and Pujols, after soaring past the 700-mark for career home runs and topping Babe Ruth in career RBIs, will attempt to continue his torrid second half.\n\n“We've had a lot of different contributors throughout the year,” first-year manager Oliver Marmol said. “What our corner guys have done in Nolan and Goldy is unbelievable. They answer the bell every day, and without them we're not here. You can go down the list. But what Albert has done has been remarkable.\"\n\nThe Phillies are pretty remarkable, too.\n\nThey were going nowhere when team president Dave Dombrowski fired manager Joe Girardi in June, replacing him with Rob Thomson. They were 23-29 and 5 1/2 games out of the playoffs, despite a payroll pushing $237 million.\n\nBut with Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber and JT Realmuto leading the offense, and a rotation featuring Aaron Nola and Game 1 starter Zack Wheeler shutting down hitters, Thomson led one of the biggest turnarounds in baseball. Only the Dodgers and Braves have better records in the NL since the soft-spoken Canadian took over.\n\n“I feel a sense of pride for these players,” Thomson said. “We’re glad to be here but we’ve got more to go.”\n\nHARPER’S HOPE\n\nHarper has largely lived up to his $330 million contract in Philadelphia, winning his second MVP last season and putting together another strong year despite a series of injuries — a small tear in his elbow ligament that turned the right fielder into a designated hitter, and a broken thumb that cost him most of the summer.\n\nThe one thing Harper hasn't done is win a postseason series, losing all four in the divisional round when with the Washington Nationals.\n\n“I’m so excited to be back here with an organization that I absolutely love,” said Harper, who hit .286 with 18 homers and 65 RBIs this season. “This is the plan, right? This is the goal, to do this. But this is Step 1, as well.\"\n\nIN THE WHEELHOUSE\n\nWheeler (12-7, 2.92 ERA) got the nod in Game 1 in part because of his two outings against the Cardinals this season. He tossed seven innings in each, allowing a combined nine hits while striking out 10 and walking two. The Phillies won both.\n\n“You just try to stay within yourself. Be yourself,” Wheeler said. “Attack hitters, work ahead and get outs.”\n\nQ'S AND ANSWERS\n\nQuintana was 3-5 with a 3.50 ERA with Pittsburgh when the Cardinals called at the trade deadline, hoping the veteran pitcher could solidify their starting rotation.\n\nIn St. Louis, he's gone 3-2 with a 2.01 ERA in 12 starts, including three innings of one-hit ball in a final tune-up Monday in Pittsburgh.\n\n“As soon as I got traded and starting pitching for the Cardinals,\" Quintana said, “I could feel the energy. It was so exciting.”\n\nCLOSING TIME\n\nBoth teams could have question marks when it comes to holding the lead in the ninth.\n\nThe Phillies' Seranthony Dominguez and David Robertson have scuffled of late, meaning former rotation stalwart Zach Eflin could be called upon to close out games. He's allowed one earned run over seven appearances out of the bullpen.\n\nRyan Helsley will get the call for the Cardinals, assuming the middle finger he jammed Tuesday against the Pirates doesn't cause him problems. Helsley threw during Thursday's workout and Marmol was optimistic about his availability.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNola (11-13, 3.25) will start Game 2 for Philadelphia on Saturday with Ranger Suarez (10-7, 3.65) getting the nod Sunday if the series goes to a decisive third game. The Cardinals will send Miles Mikolas (12-13, 3.29) out in Game 2, but Marmol was coy with his plans for a potential decider, saying: “When we get to Game 3, I’ll announce it then.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/10/18/2022-nlcs-playoff-schedule-padres-phillies-times-tv-live-strem/10532825002/", "title": "San Diego Padres vs. Philadelphia Phillies in 2022 NLCS: Schedule ...", "text": "It's been more than a decade in the making, but the Philadelphia Phillies are back in the National League Championship Series and on the brink of reaching the World Series.

San Diego first traveled to New York to dispatch a 101-win Mets team before conquering its biggest foe and most hated rival, the juggernaut Los Angeles Dodgers, who won a major-league leading 111 games this season.\n\nSUPER STARS:Linked by 2019 free agent frenzy, Harper and Machado square off in NLCS\n\nOPINION: It's time fans adapted to MLB's imperfect playoff format\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nPLAYOFF SCHEDULE: Results, game times and matchups for every series\n\nThe Phillies last played in the NLCS in 2010; the Padres last made that round in 1998.

He told MacPhail that before they fired GM Matt Klentak.\n\nDombrowski had just moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and agreed in June of 2020 to be consultant and advisor for the Nashville Stars ownership group, paving their expansion franchise efforts.\n\nSorry, he told MacPhail, his best friend in baseball for nearly 45 years, attending each other’s weddings, he was not interested.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\n“I know he kept saying no,\" Phillies owner John Middleton said, “but I wasn’t going take no as an answer unless I heard it directly from his own mouth.’’\n\nNow, 22 months later after turning down the job again and again, here is Dombrowski, leading the Phillies to the World Series for the first time since 2009, with Game 1 on Friday night against the Houston Astros.\n\n“We aren’t here without him,’’ Middleton told USA TODAY Sports in a 90-minute interview from his home. “We are watching a guy that is historically great. One hundred years from now, when they ask, who are the best GMs in the history of the game, Dave Dombrowski may just be the best.\n\nDombrowski, president of baseball operations, is the first executive to lead four different franchises to the World Series, and vying to be the first to win a World Series with three different teams. He led the Florida Marlins to the World Series championship in 1997, the Detroit Tigers to the World Series in 2006 and 2012, the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2018, and now the Phillies.\n\n“I’ll bet any amount of money that will never be broken,’’ Middleton said, “not 100 years from now. Not 200 years from now.’’\n\nDombrowski has a provision in his contract that permits him to leave if Nashville gets an expansion team and he’s offered to run their baseball department, but sorry, Middleton said, there will not be a next team.\n\n“There’s not a chance that we'll let him get away,’’ Middleton said.\n\nDombrowski, 66, has two more years remaining on his four-year, $20 million contract, but there already are plans to lock him up to an extension, perhaps keeping him in Philadelphia for the rest of his career.\n\nReally, there’s no chance Dombrowski has any intention of parting company anyways, falling in love with the city, the culture of the organization, and, Middleton.\n\nThis is home.\n\nThis is where he’s appreciated.\n\n'CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES': How the NFL chased MLB World Series off football's holy day\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nDombrowski still has trouble understanding why he was fired by the Red Sox. They won a World Series just 45 weeks earlier. They won three consecutive division titles. Their farm system was being restocked. The future was bright. And voila, right before a night game Sept. 8, 2019, he was fired.\n\n“I don’t think I was treated right,’’ Dombrowski tells USA TODAY Sports. “It hurt. It didn’t end the way I hoped or was handled.’’\n\nThe Phillies, ironically, were next up on the Red Sox schedule. Dombrowski was scheduled to have dinner with MacPhail. He never showed. Instead, Red Sox owner John Henry came to Philadelphia.\n\n“I still don’t have any idea why John Henry fired him,’’ Middleton said. “I really don’t understand it. But I’m grateful he did. We wouldn’t have Dave Dombrowski and we wouldn’t be in the World Series.’’\n\nHenry didn’t address the firing until three weeks later, simply saying, “Right after the World Series, I think it became clear to me that perhaps we weren’t going to be on the same wavelength going forward. But I was hopeful throughout the year, that maybe that perception would change. It didn’t.’’\n\nThe firing left Dombrowski disillusioned and guarded. He was blindsided in Boston. He wasn’t about to let it happen again.\n\nA year later, MacPhail telephoned Dombrowski a couple of days before the firing of Klentak to gauge his interest. There was none.\n\nThe Phillies officially fired Klentak, technically demoting him, on Oct. 3, 2020, after five consecutive losing seasons. MacPhail again called Dombrowski. The answer remained the same.\n\n“I had given my word to Nashville,’’ Dombrowski said. “They were paying me a nice sum of money. I didn’t see that it was right to leave.’’\n\nThe Phillies began the interview process. They interviewed more than 30 candidates. They trimmed down to seven . Then, it was two: Minnesota Twins GM Thad Levine and former Orioles and Red Sox GM Dan Duquette.\n\nThey offered the job to Levine, who had even come to Philadelphia to house-hunt. Levine, who went to college at Haverford in Pennsylvania, decided to stay put. He and his wife, with their three kids, love the Minneapolis area, the Twins organization, and ultimately didn’t want to uproot the family.\n\nMiddleton then told MacPhail to reach out one more time to Dombrowski, and if he said no again, wanted to at least hear it from his own mouth. MacPhail called him, got the same answer, and asked him if it was okay if Middleton called.\n\n“I said to Andy, if he doesn’t want to work, he doesn’t want to work,’’ Middleton said. “But I’d like to hear that directly.’’\n\nMiddleton telephoned the next day and basically told Dombrowski he was wasting his time in Nashville. The city wasn’t close to getting a team, certainly not by 2024, which Dombrowski believed.\n\n“If you don’t want to work, that’s one thing,\" Middleton told Dombrowski. \"If you do want to work, it won’t be in Nashville. You should talk to (Commissioner) Rob (Manfred).’\"\n\nSo, Dombrowski telephoned Manfred and MLB officials, who confirmed Middleton’s opinion. Nashville may indeed be the No. 1 expansion site. But expansion isn’t close.\n\nSaid Middleton: “I told him, 'I’ll let you out of your contract any time you want. If there’s anything going on in Nashville that could change their landscape, you can opt out of your contract anytime you want.’\"\n\nJohn Loar, managing director of Music City Baseball, who hired Dombrowski, told him he had no obligation to stay. He can remain as an advisor, and if he wanted to come back, the door was open.\n\n“We weren’t going to keep him here when he had such a great opportunity,’’ Loar said. “We couldn’t be happier for him. He’s showing what he means to an organization.’’\n\nMiddleton and Dombrowski kept talking. It was in the middle of COVID, and Dombrowski and Middleton never met face-to-face, with their interactions limited to the telephone.\n\n“It doesn’t take a lot of time to interview Dave Dombrowski,’’ Middleton said. “It wasn’t whether Dave is good enough person to get the job. I had to convince the man to come back and help me. He wants to know, 'Does this guy want to win? Is this guy pinching pennies to pay a 20-year-old rookie $500,000 instead of a good, competent veteran that cost $5 million?'\n\n“I told him, 'You have a lot of latitude here. I’m prepared to lose money. I’m prepared to lose a lot of money. I just want to win.’’’\n\nMost important, Middleton stressed, you can trust him. Just ask around.\n\n“The biggest thing was that he needed to be reassured,’’ Middleton said, “having been burned in Boston. When you win the 2018 World Series title, and you’re fired the following August, you can’t go through that process and have it not affect you psychologically and emotionally. Dave needed to know that he wasn’t going to walk into a situation where I was going to flip on him.\n\n“Andy was invaluable and deserves a lot of credit. He was really helpful re-assuring Dave about me. We wouldn’t have Dave without Andy.’’\n\nMacPhail, who became best of friends with Dombrowski from their days together in Chicago in the late 70’s when MacPhail worked for the Cubs and Dombrowski for the White Sox, told Dombrowski he had never been to a place that was more family-oriented than the Phillies. There was no one more beloved than former Phillies president Dave Montgomery, who set the franchise’s vision, while Middleton’s passion for the franchise and city of Philadelphia was unparalleled.\n\n“When you lose 100 games, and you’re with the Middletons and Bucks (chairman David Bucks) singing Christmas carols,’’ MacPhail said, “it tells you all you need to know. I was not doing that with (Orioles owner) Peter Angelos.’’\n\nIt wasn’t until a month after Dombrowski accepted the job that he even met Middleton face-to-face in the Phillies’ office with COVID raging.\n\nThey greeted one another in the hallway on the second floor of the executive offices, put on masks, gave each other a fist-bump, retreated to their offices, and then talked on the phone for several hours.\n\nDombrowski quickly impressed Middleton by asking if he could promote Sam Fuld to GM and Jorge Velandia to assistant GM, saying they were invaluable to the organization. The analytics department, which was a one-man band making $100,000 in 2014, now is budgeted for the millions. The Phillies, who had gone 10 years without a playoff berth, let alone a winning season, produced its first back-to-back winning seasons in a decade.\n\nAnd the Phillies are back on the center stage of the baseball world with Dombrowski becoming only the third GM/head of baseball operations to win National League pennants with two franchises, joining Branch Rickey and Bob Howsam.\n\nDombrowski has made a slew of brilliant moves and signings since his arrival, but the one that may be most responsible for the Phillies’ World Series berth was the decision to fire manager Joe Girardi and replace him with bench coach Rob Thomson.\n\nMiddleton and Dombrowski quietly had been talking about the possibility of needing to replace Girardi for almost a year, but wanted to give Girardi a little more time, seeing if the team can perform to its potential.\n\n“You can be a good manager, but sometimes the personality or style is not the right fit for a clubhouse, and I think that was the case with Joe,’’ Middleton said.\n\nThe Phillies waited as long as they could, but when they were 22-29, 12 games out of first place, Dombrowski went for a morning run to clear his head. When he got back to his apartment, he called Middleton. It was time to make a change. Girardi was fired, Thomson was promoted to be the interim manager.\n\n“It was no surprise,’’ Middleton said. “Quite frankly, I was waiting for Dave to make this decision. We had talked about it, but Dave still wasn’t there until that morning.’’\n\nIt worked out greater than even Middleton and Dombrowski imagined, with the Phillies going 65-46, despite a late swoon when the Phillies nearly coughed up a playoff berth by losing 10 of 13 games before clinching the wild card spot in Houston.\n\nThey talked about removing Thomson’s interim label in the second half, but when the Phillies struggled, Dombrowski told Middleton he wanted to see how the team would respond.\n\n“Dave told me, 'This is a very important test for Rob,’ ‘’Middleton said. “'I need to see how he handles this, the pressure, the players feeling pressure. The really good managers can deal with this. If you can win a World Series, you’ve got to have a manager deal with this because pressure mounts. If a manager can’t handle going through a slump, that, you’ve got to think whether you really want that person to help this team.’\n\n“Rob was such a calming force for the players.’’\n\nMiddleton asked Dombrowski if he was ready to make Thomson the permanent manager when they clinched the playoff berth in Houston with two games to spare. Not yet. Dombrowski still wanted to wait. When they swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the wild-card round, celebrating in the middle of the visiting clubhouse at Busch Stadium, Dombrowski leaned over to Middleton and said, “I need to talk to you about Rob.’’\n\nDombrowski called Middleton at 9 the next morning. Middleton telephoned MLB to inform them they were making an internal promotion and would not need to interview outside candidates. And Thomson was rewarded with a two-year contract on Oct. 10.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Phillies are clinching a World Series berth, Dombrowski and Middleton are holding the National League Championship trophy in the air, and MacPhail is in Middleton’s suite, listening to the ovation from the frenzied sellout crowd.\n\n“Having gone through this here, seeing the expression and emotions on everyone’s faces,’’ Dombrowski said, “it’s like seeing your children opening Christmas presents.

Clemens picked up the splintered wood and threw it angrily in front of Piazza as he ran toward first, missing the Mets’ star by about 2 feet. Clemens then pitched the best World Series game of his career with a two-hit, nine-strikeout shutout before leaving after eight innings in the Yankees’ nervous 6-5 victory.\n\n2003 — Alex Gonzalez led off the bottom of the 12th with a solo homer, lifting Florida to a 4-3 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series.

Braves manager Bobby Cox brought in closer Mark Wohlers for a two-inning save against the bottom third of the Yankee order in the eighth. Yankees backup catcher Jim Leyritz came to the plate for his first at bat of the night with two men on.

Koufax won the pitchers’ Triple Crown, leading the league in wins (25), strikeouts (306) and ERA (1.88). Koufax set a record for shutouts by a left-handed pitcher with 11, that stands to this day. The previous record of nine shutouts had been held by Babe Ruth for nearly 50 years.\n\n1981 — The Los Angeles Dodgers came back to beat the New York Yankees 8-7 in a sloppy 3½-hour marathon and tied the World Series 2-2. The Yankees blew a 6-3 lead. On one play, Reggie Jackson lost the ball in the sun and it bounced off his shoulder for a two-base error.\n\n1985 — Danny Jackson’s five-hitter cut St. Louis’ lead to 3-2 in the World Series as the Kansas City Royals took Game 5, 6-1.

The Mets also ended the Yankees’ record 14-game winning streak in the World Series.\n\n2004 — Boston’s Curt Schilling became the first starting pitcher to win a World Series game for three different teams, as the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-2, for 2-0 lead in the Series. Schilling, the fifth pitcher to win a World Series game with a team from both leagues, had won with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.\n\n2005 — Scott Podsednik homered in the bottom of the ninth inning and Paul Konerko hit the 18th grand slam in World Series history in Chicago’s 7-6 win over Houston in Game 2 of the World Series.\n\n2007 — Boston set a record for runs and victory margin in a World Series opener as the Red Sox flattened the Rockies 13-1. Boston finished with 17 hits, becoming the first club to hit eight doubles in a Series game since 1925.\n\n2012 — Pablo Sandoval became the fourth player to hit three home runs in a World Series game, connecting twice against Justin Verlander and once off Al Alburquerque to lead the San Francisco Giants over the Detroit Tigers 8-3 in the series opener.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/10/24/world-series-has-modern-feel-astros-phillies-matchup/10588177002/", "title": "Astros, Phillies give World Series a truly postmodern feel", "text": "It will be a World Series in the most modern sense.\n\nAfter all, the Philadelphia Phillies gained entry to this postseason thanks to a playoff berth that did not exist a year ago. And while the Phillies and Houston Astros have a postseason history, it dates to the 1980 National League Championship Series — some 32 years before the Astros would be booted to the American League, tear down their operation and build back a dynasty.\n\nSo come Friday, when the No. 6 seed from the NL — purists, close this tab now — and the four-times-in-six-years AL pennant-winning Astros clash in Game 1 at Houston's Minute Maid Park, it will truly be a postmodern Fall Classic.\n\nALCS:Astros sweep aside Yankees to reach World Series for fourth time in six years\n\nNLCS:Bryce Harper becomes legend, lifting Phillies to first World Series since 2009\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nWORLD SERIES:MLB's complete 2022 postseason schedule\n\nHere are four things to know as we head toward Justin Verlander’s first pitch in Game 1:\n\nScorned stars\n\nIt's hard to find two more boisterous venues for a World Series than Minute Maid and Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park, which has resembled a South Philly bacchanalia the past two playoff rounds.\n\nBut don’t worry about the principal actors getting unnerved on this massive stage. They’ve seen much worse.\n\nThe Astros, of course, are now three seasons into their role as baseball’s chief villains, with one season without attendance restrictions since their sign-stealing scandal was revealed. They were thoroughly unaffected by a return to New York for the ALCS, thumping the Yankees in two games as the boos for scandal protagonists Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman lost steam as the Yankees lost ground.\n\n“Obviously, the Yankees' fans are really, you know, fans. And they get in the game a lot,\" Altuve said, diplomatically as possible. “They, you know, really love the game. How can I say it? They love the game. It's a little different here than other places.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NLCS MVP and $330 million man Bryce Harper has been the subject of boos since he was a teenager, simply because … well … we’re not entirely sure, actually.\n\nHarper had the chutzpah to submit to a Sports Illustrated cover story at age 16, essentially calling his shot that he would not only make the major leagues but be a dominant player.\n\nBy 23, he was the NL MVP.\n\nSomehow, this has made him a target of boos everywhere he’s gone. That now includes Washington, where he played perhaps the biggest role in elevating a middling franchise to relevance. Rather than thank you, he’s reminded that he should have accepted a below-market offer from the team that already harvested seven years of his career.\n\nNow, after batting .400, hitting a pair of home runs – including the series-clinching two-run shot in Game 5 – he’s NLCS MVP, and finally facing an opponent that gets more shade than him.\n\nDugout discrepancy\n\nDusty Baker has been doing this since 1993. Rob Thomson has been doing this since June.\n\nOK, that’s a little unfair. Thomson, who rightfully had the interim tag removed from his managerial title after the Phillies advanced out of the wild-card round against the St. Louis Cardinals, is a consummate baseball lifer, spending three decades in the Yankees organization, including 10 seasons as their bench coach. He left for a similar opportunity in Philly, survived the Gabe Kapler firing and continued on when Joe Girardi took over the Phillies dugout.\n\nNow, Girardi’s firing and Thomson’s elevation to the manager’s chair is undeniably a turning point in their season.\n\nThe Phillies were 22-29 under Girardi, 65-46 under Thomson and now 9-2 in the postseason. Certainly, it’s never as simple as switching out the manager’s chair, especially when so many Philly sluggers were slumping badly when Girardi was canned. Yet the subsequent resurgence of Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos and the grander role assumed by youngsters like shortstop Bryson Stott and outfielder Matt Vierling probably aren’t so pronounced without the more relaxed air under Thomson.\n\nAs for Dusty?\n\nHe’s headed to back-to-back World Series, his third in a 25-year managerial career in which he hasn’t been fully appreciated until the twilight. Much will be made about the win-it-for-Dusty narrative, and Astros players will dutifully answer, even if they know the chance to win a ring themselves can be just as fleeting.\n\nBut there is genuine love for their 73-year-old manager, whose 2,093 career wins ranks ninth all time. The “Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!” chant that broke out on the victory podium following Sunday’s ALCS clincher and the insistence his retro dance moves be included in their clubhouse celebrations reflect an appreciation that he is the final piece of an organizational ethos that empower the player.\n\nIf this is it, a title would be one heck of a way to go out. As for Thomson, he’ll ascend the 100-win mark next year — at worst, at the helm of the defending NL champions.\n\nRelief efforts\n\nOh, this series will have aces: While Philadelphia is known for its slugging, Games 1-2 starters Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler are probably the biggest single reason why the Phillies stayed in the race — and gained the upper hand on the Cardinals, Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres in the playoffs.\n\nAnd Verlander, at 38 and with a rebuilt elbow, is the favorite to win the AL Cy Young Award, backed by oft-dominant lefty Framber Valdez and fearless veteran Lance McCullers Jr.\n\nBut most games will be won or lost by the bullpens. And the Astros’ is bordering on the absurd.\n\nAbsurdly dominant, that is.\n\nIn 33 postseason innings, Houston’s bullpen has yielded three earned runs and posted a 0.82 ERA, with 52 strikeouts and just 10 walks. Right-hander Bryan Abreu has been particularly filthy, with six scoreless outings and 10 strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings while finding himself in increasingly higher-leverage roles.\n\nThe power arms are so abundant that Ryne Stanek, who had an outstanding regular season (1.15 ERA, 62 strike outs in 54 2/3 innings) has been invisible much of the postseason, not appearing in a game until the 11th inning of ALDS Game 3. He’s thrown just two innings (and struck out four of six batters faced) but realizes Houston’s arms edge won’t depreciate with each passing round because, well, they’re so stacked.\n\n“The starters make our jobs way easier by not overexposing us, by their ability to go deep into games and keeping games close,” says Stanek. “ All the guys in the bullpen passing the baton and keeping it where it’s at, it’s incredible.\n\n“It makes a tremendous difference having the depth we have. We can throw out anybody in the bullpen in any situation and feel comfortable they’re going to get the job done because they’ve been battle-tested, they’ve executed in big spots all year.\n\n“Once you get in these situations, you have to roll deep. Because if you don’t, and you only ride a handful of guys, that tax wears on people eventually. But having the ability to roll six, seven guys deep, of very effective arms that can throw leverage, that can throw multis, that can do all the things, is tremendous.”\n\nThe Phillies? They’re, um, not quite so fortunate.\n\nThe bullpen has been a sticking point for years in Philadelphia, probably the No. 1 unit keeping the club from realizing its postseason potential over several years of 80-ish wins promise. Yet the crew fell into place rather serendipitously in recent weeks.\n\nStarter Zach Eflin became a part-time ninth-inning guy because he didn’t have enough time to recover from a knee injury to rejoin the rotation late in the year. Fireballing lefty Jose Alvarado was optioned to the minors shortly before Girardi was fired; he’s now a threat to take down batters over multiple innings. David Robertson hurt his calf celebrating the club’s NL wild-card triumph in St. Louis. He’s recovered just in time to cover late innings as needed.\n\nAnd when Robertson couldn’t close the ninth in Game 5 of the NLCS, Ranger Suarez — who threw five innings and was the winning pitcher in Game 2 — came in on one day of rest to record the final two outs, including the clincher.\n\nThe Phillies’ ad hoc relief plan will leave them at a significant disadvantage. But that doesn’t mean they can’t find their way to 27 outs.\n\nNew blood\n\nHere’s your semi-annual reminder that the true “winners” at the trade deadline are often not those who make the splashiest headlines.\n\nLittle was made when the Phillies shipped one of their best prospects, catcher Logan O’Hoppe, to the Los Angeles Angels for center fielder Brandon Marsh. Their acquisition of utility infielder Edmundo Sosa barely registered outside of Philadelphia.\n\nBut both players significantly improved the team’s defensive profile and Marsh’s three-run home run in Game 4 of the NLDS might have been the biggest blow to help knock out the defending champion Braves.\n\nSimilarly, DH Trey Mancini and catcher Christian Vazquez weren’t viewed as difference-makers when Houston added them, and Mancini struggled mightily after his trade from the Baltimore Orioles. But both pitched in significantly in toppling Yankees ace Gerrit Cole in the pivotal Game 3 of the ALCS, and Vazquez, teamed with fellow veteran catcher Martin Maldonado, brings a 2018 championship ring and significant dog mentality to the squad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

Discovery. The studio on Tuesday named Gunn and veteran executive Peter Safran co-chairmen and CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios.\n\nThe roles will have Gunn and Safran developing a long-term plan for the company’s DC Comics properties, in film, television and animation. Both will continue to also produce, develop and direct individual projects, the studio said.\n\n“We’re honored to be the stewards of these DC characters we’ve loved since we were children,” said Gunn and Safran in a written statement. “Our commitment to Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Harley Quinn, and the rest of the DC stable of characters is only equaled by our commitment to the wonder of human possibility these characters represent. We’re excited to invigorate the theatrical experience around the world as we tell some of the biggest, most beautiful, and grandest stories ever told.”\n\nSafran has produced many films for Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, including Gunn’s “The Suicide Squad” as well as “Aquaman,” “Shazam” and the horror films in “The Conjuring” universe.\n\nStarting Nov. 1, Gunn and Safran will report directly to David Zaslav, the president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, who praised their “singular and complementary talents” in a statement.\n\n“Their decades of experience in filmmaking, close ties to the creative community, and proven track record thrilling superhero fans around the globe make them uniquely qualified to develop a long-term strategy across film, TV, and animation, and take this iconic franchise to the next level of creative storytelling,” Zaslav continued.\n\nHow James Gunn retooled this 'Suicide Squad' and made these supervillains his own\n\nFor the past four years, Walter Hamada headed what was previously called DC Films but officially departed the studio last week, ahead of the theatrical launch of “ Black Adam.”\n\nZaslav had promised a “reset” to the studio’s DC operations in an overhaul to implement a more Marvel-like 10-year structure and improve quality, and with that, bring in a more centralized creative executive, akin to Marvel’s Kevin Feige. Some in Hollywood were surprised Tuesday when, instead, two were named.\n\nUnlike Marvel, DC has several different threads operating simultaneously in its films with Todd Phillips’ “Joker” sequel and Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” in addition to the films of Henry Cavill’s Superman, who made an appearance in “Black Adam.”\n\nReview: James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad' is a bloody marvel that blows up the superhero genre\n\nGunn, the rare filmmaker to have active projects with both main superhero powerhouses, is also wrapping up his “Guardians of the Galaxy” trilogy, which is expected in May, and he’ll have a “Guardians” holiday special on Disney+ in November too — the trailer was revealed just shortly before the DC announcement.\n\nMike De Luca and Pam Abdy, co-chairpersons and CEOs of Warner Bros. Film Group, said in a joint statement that, “to have them both committing to work together to forge this new era for DC is a literal dream come true. We all share a very similar sensibility and passion for this universe and the stars couldn’t have aligned any better.”\n\nReview: Great 'Guardians of the Galaxy' sequel is just short of magical", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/politics/dark-money-donation-conservative-group-invs/index.html", "title": "Massive dark money donation: New conservative group got $1.6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new group led by a prominent conservative lawyer has received $1.6 billion from one donor – the largest single contribution to a politically focused nonprofit that’s ever been made public, and a fortune that could be used to fuel right-wing interests.\n\nThe nonprofit, Marble Freedom Trust, received the contribution in the form of stock and then funneled more than $200 million to other conservative organizations last year, a tax form CNN obtained from the IRS shows.\n\nMarble Freedom is led by Leonard Leo, the co-chairman of the conservative Federalist Society, who advised former President Donald Trump on his Supreme Court picks and runs a sprawling network of other right-wing nonprofits that don’t disclose their donors, which are often referred to as dark money groups.\n\nA CNN review of financial documents connected the donation to Barre Seid, a low-profile, 90-year-old Chicago electronics company executive and philanthropist who has previously been tied to smaller anonymous contributions to other right-wing groups. The New York Times, which first reported the contribution on Monday, also identified Seid as the donor.\n\nThe massive donation instantly makes the Utah-based group one of the most well-funded organizations bankrolling conservative causes in the US – a staggering distinction for a group with zero public profile or even a website. In comparison, the single contribution is more than double the total amount raised by Trump’s presidential campaign committee during the entire 2020 election cycle.\n\nRobert Maguire, the research director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called the donation “stupefying,” and “by far” the largest known contribution to a dark money political group.\n\n“I’ve never seen a group of this magnitude before,” Maguire said. “This is the kind of money that can help these political operatives and their allies start to move the needle on issues like reshaping the federal judiciary, making it more difficult to vote, a state-by-state campaign to remake election laws and lay the groundwork for undermining future elections.”\n\nLeo said in a statement that “it’s high time for the conservative movement to be among the ranks of George Soros, Hansjörg Wyss, Arabella Advisors and other left-wing philanthropists, going toe-to-toe in the fight to defend our Constitution and its ideals” – referring to two liberal-leaning billionaires and a consulting firm that manages several smaller dark money groups on the left.\n\nSeid did not respond to requests for comment left on phone numbers listed for him and his longtime assistant.\n\nHuge anonymous donation has ties to Chicago executive\n\n“Dark money” generally refers to nonprofits that get involved in politics but do not disclose their donors, a practice that significantly ramped up after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010. Many dark money groups, like Marble Freedom, are 501(c)4 organizations – nonprofits that are allowed to participate in politics as long as it is not their primary activity.\n\nGroups on both sides of the political spectrum have increasingly turned to dark money in recent years to sway voters or push agendas without revealing their ultra-wealthy benefactors – but the Marble Freedom donation dramatically eclipses even the largest of the previously known groups.\n\nMarble Freedom’s tax return covers its initial year of existence between May 2020 and April 2021. The gift of just over $1.6 billion came in the form of 100% of the stock of a privately held company, which Marble Freedom then sold to another company, according to the tax form.\n\nThe arrangement likely saved Seid a large amount of money in taxes, according to Marcus Owens, an attorney and former director of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, who reviewed the form for CNN. If Seid had personally sold the stock in the company, he would likely have had to pay capital gains tax on the proceeds of the sale. By donating the stock to Marble Freedom, he avoided having to pay that tax, and the nonprofit would be exempt from paying it.\n\nMarble Freedom wrote that it was withholding information about which company was donated and who it sold to because “disclosing it would effectively disclose the identity of its donors.”\n\nBut details about the donation connect it to the sale of the Chicago-based electrical device firm Tripp Lite, whose longtime chairman was Seid.\n\nAfter receiving the donated stock, Marble Freedom sold the company on March 17, 2021, according to the tax form. The same day, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the American-Irish power company Eaton acquired Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion.\n\nDuring the sale, “the sole shareholder of Tripp Lite” was represented by New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Law360 reported at the time. Less than two weeks later, Marble Freedom paid Sullivan & Cromwell $940,000 in legal fees, the tax form shows. A spokesperson for Eaton said the company would not provide more details about the acquisition, and several lawyers involved in the transaction did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeid served as chairman and CEO and listed himself as the “owner” of Tripp Lite in federal campaign donation records from 2008. He worked at the company, which produces power strips, surge protectors and other devices, for more than 50 years, according to a Facebook post from Tripp Lite. He grew up in Chicago, the son of immigrants from Russia, according to Census records, and graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nSeid has previously had a history of donating anonymously to conservative political groups and causes. An internal 2015 document from the Bradley Foundation, a right-wing nonprofit, stated that the conservative think tank Foundation for Government Accountability had received support from “Barre Seid (anonymously).” The document was part of a trove of records from Bradley that was hacked and released, and was later included as an exhibit in Senate testimony.\n\nIn addition, Salon reported in 2010 that “Barry Seid” was listed in tax documents as the identity of an anonymous donor who gave nearly $17 million to a group that produced an anti-Islam documentary and sent DVDs of the movie to millions of households during the 2008 election. An assistant for Seid told Salon that he did not contribute to the organization, although she didn’t address whether he made the donation by routing it through another group.\n\nAnd publicly released emails suggest that Seid may also be the anonymous donor who pledged $20 million over five years to George Mason University’s law school in order to rename it for former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The emails were obtained through a public records request and published by George Mason Law alum Allison Pienta in 2019. The school has refused to identify the donor but has said that Leo coordinated the gift.\n\nSeid and his wife make public donations through another nonprofit, the Barbara and Barre Seid Foundation, which mostly funds Chicago-based cultural organizations and universities but has given to conservative and libertarian groups such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute. Seid also donated to various political campaigns in Illinois and elsewhere in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nBig spending and opaque groups\n\nEven in its infancy, Marble Freedom Trust has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to other dark money groups.\n\nLeo, Marble Freedom’s chairman and trustee, is one of the most influential figures in the world of conservative dark money. A longtime executive at the Federalist Society, a national network of right-leaning lawyers, Leo has led or served on the board of more than a dozen different nonprofits. Several of his groups have been associated with political campaigns promoting conservative Supreme Court nominees, operating in complex networks of spending.\n\nThe new $1.6 billion donation “solidifies Leo as just an absolute gravitational force within the conservative political and legal world,” Maguire said. “He was already the man behind the scenes raising money for reshaping the American judiciary, and this amount of money just takes it to a stratospheric level.”\n\nOn the Marble Freedom tax form, Leo is listed as being paid a $350,000 annual salary for 25 hours a week of work for the group.\n\nThe form states that the group’s mission is to “maintain and expand human freedom consistent with the values and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.” While politics can’t be its primary focus, it can use at least some of its huge resources to influence this year’s midterms or future elections.\n\n“This is such a significant amount that it would be a game-changer if they do decide to devote even a portion of that to election-related spending,” said Anna Massoglia, the Editorial and Investigations Manager at OpenSecrets, a group that researches campaign finance.\n\nMarble Freedom reported making four donations to other nonprofits – transactions that appear to have taken place between the sale of the stock in mid-March 2021 and the end of April 2021.\n\nThe largest contribution was a $153 million gift to the Rule of Law Trust, a dark money nonprofit led by Leo that has funded other conservative organizations. The group’s tax returns show it received just under $80 million in donations in 2018 and no contributions in 2019 or 2020, so the gift from Marble Freedom represents a massive funding boost for the organization.\n\nMarble Freedom contributed $41.1 million to Donors Trust, a nonprofit that distributes money to conservative and libertarian groups in addition to nonpolitical organizations. The group is a donor-advised fund, which means its contributors can recommend where their donations to the fund are sent.\n\nIn the past, Donors Trust has funneled millions of dollars to groups that have amplified false claims about election fraud and advocated for more restrictive voting rules. The group has previously said that its donations are intended to “serve the public good.”\n\nMarble Freedom also donated $16.5 million to The Concord Fund, a nonprofit that has advocated for conservative nominees to the Supreme Court and other judgeships and is associated with a group that has pushed restrictive voting laws. Concord, which was previously known as the Judicial Crisis Network, raised $20.4 million from July 2019 to June 2020, according to its most recent tax return.\n\nIn addition to the three groups with political connections, Marble Freedom gave $18 million to Schwab Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.\n\nMarble Freedom lists two other board members in addition to Leo, both of whom are unpaid. One is Tyler Green, the former solicitor general of Utah, who has represented the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups in multiple voting-related lawsuits in recent years. Green, who is listed as Marble Freedom’s administrative trustee, is also a former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The trust’s address is listed as a home in North Salt Lake, Utah, that Green owns.\n\nThe board’s third member is Jonathan Bunch, a former Federalist Society vice president who has been involved with various groups led by Leo. Bunch is listed as Marble Freedom’s successor trustee. Green and Bunch did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the end of April 2021, Marble Freedom had more than $1.4 billion in assets – positioning it to play a major role in conservative causes potentially for years to come.\n\n“This group is emblematic of the corrosion and the breakdown of our campaign finance system,” Maguire said – and how it gives “wealthy donors, whether they be corporations or individuals, access and influence over the system far greater than any regular American can ever imagine.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Curt Devine Drew Griffin", "Casey Tolan", "Curt Devine", "Drew Griffin"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business/spanx-new-ceo/index.html", "title": "Spanx names a new CEO | CNN Business", "text": "1.

One source said there were multiple planning calls between Trump campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet on December 14, 2020, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.\n\nTrump and some of his top advisers publicly encouraged the “alternate electors” scheme in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico. But behind the scenes, Giuliani and Trump campaign officials actively choreographed the process, the sources said.\n\nOne fake elector from Michigan boasted at a recent event hosted by a local Republican organization that the Trump campaign directed the entire operation.\n\n“We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that,” Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, said at a public event last week that was organized by the conservative group Stand Up Michigan, according to a recording obtained by CNN.\n\nListen to Meshawn Maddock describe the Trump campaign’s involvement in the fake elector plot at a recent speech in Michigan “[Matt Maddock] fought for investigations into every part of the election we could. He fought for a team of people to come and testify in front of the committee. We fought to seat the electors. Um, the Trump campaign asked us to do that – under a lot of scrutiny for that today. My husband has, he’s suffered for that a little bit in Lansing because it’s not very popular, but you know when you represent the whole state of Michigan and that’s what I see it now. I realize that even though you’re going to vote for somebody to be your next state representative, your next state senator, the truth is, this body of people, they represent all of us.\n\nMaddock was also one of the 16 Trump supporters from Michigan who served as fake electors and signed the illegitimate certificate that was sent to the National Archives.\n\n“It was Rudy and these misfit characters who started calling the shots,” a former Trump campaign staffer said. “The campaign was throwing enough sh*t at the wall to see what would stick.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Extraordinary rebuke of the former President': Toobin weighs in on SCOTUS decision 02:48 - Source: CNN\n\nIntegral to the Jan 6 plan\n\nThe scheme was integral to Trump’s plan to get then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden’s electors and replace them with the GOP electors on January 6 when Congress counted the electoral votes. It has also come under renewed scrutiny by the January 6 select committee and state attorneys general, raising questions about the involvement of Trump’s campaign and whether any laws were broken.\n\nCommittee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi told reporters Thursday the panel is looking into whether there was a broader conspiracy or involvement from the Trump White House in the creation or submission of these fake electors.\n\n“That’s a concern” Thompson said.\n\nIn its subpoena letter sent to Giuliani on Tuesday, the House committee specifically references his efforts to convince state legislatures to overturn election results. The document cites Giuliani’s comments from December 2020 in which he publicly urged lawmakers in Michigan to award the state’s electoral votes to Trump.\n\nOne of the pro-Trump electors from Pennsylvania, Sam DeMarco, told CNN there was a last-minute dispute, where the state’s GOP electors pushed Trump campaign officials to add legal caveats to the fake certificate to say they were only electors-in-waiting, if Trump’s legal challenges prevailed.\n\nThe fake documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico ultimately contained these caveats, but the documents from the other five states explicitly claimed, falsely, that the pro-Trump electors were the rightful electors.\n\nIt’s not clear that any of the fake electors themselves participated in strategy sessions with top Trump campaign brass. But both Maddock from Michigan and DeMarco from Pennsylvania have said they were in direct contact with members of the Trump campaign.\n\nMany of the players involved in the scheme, including Maddock, stand by their actions and are still pushing the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Giuliani, a Trump spokesperson and a representative from Stand Up Michigan did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAdvancing the lie that the election was stolen\n\nAfter Trump failed to stop battleground states from certifying Biden’s victory, Trump campaign officials, led by Giuliani, launched its parallel effort to disrupt and undermine the Electoral College process. This included publicly promoting false claims of fraud, while quietly exploring the fast-diminishing avenues to overturn the results.\n\nTrump hoped Republican legislators from the seven battleground states would replace Biden’s authentic electors with the rogue GOP slate, and that Pence would seat those electors during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi preside over a Joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 Electoral College results after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol earlier in the day on January 6, 2021. J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nA source familiar with the situation told CNN that Pence was concerned about the possibility of “alternate electors,” and his team carefully worded what he said that day during the Electoral College certification to recognize only the legitimate electors.\n\nOne of the sources with direct knowledge of the scheme, a former Trump campaign staffer, told CNN that Giuliani worked closely on the seven-state stunt with Christina Bobb, a correspondent for the pro-Trump propaganda network One America News.\n\nMany of Giuliani’s unhinged conspiracies about the 2020 election found a home at OAN. And in a deposition last year as part of a civil lawsuit, Giuliani said Bobb was “very active in gathering evidence” as “part of the legal team” working for Trump’s campaign during the presidential transition.\n\nBobb reached out to a top Arizona legislator about supposed voter fraud, according to emails obtained by the government oversight group American Oversight through a public records request. In the December 4, 2020, email Bobb said she was sending the message on Giuliani’s behalf. The emails flesh out how Trump’s team was trying to press state legislatures to overturn the results.\n\nBobb didn’t respond to messages seeking comment about the pro-Trump electors.\n\n“They were all working together. Rudy, John Eastman, and Christina Bobb, in tandem, to create this coverage for OAN, to advance the Big Lie,” the former Trump campaign staffer told CNN.\n\nWhile mainstream news outlets covered the Electoral College proceedings, which cemented Biden’s position as President-elect, OAN focused on the rogue electors and voter fraud myths.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported new details about the role of Giuliani and Bobb.\n\nBattleground Michigan\n\nRepublicans in Michigan were central to the effort to try and overturn the election results and Meshawn Maddock – along with her husband State Rep. Matt Maddock – were instrumental to the effort inside the state.\n\nThe Maddocks have deep ties to Trump. The former president has endorsed Matt Maddock in his bid to be Michigan House leader. Maddock tweeted a photo last year of an article written about his campaign that Trump had signed, and added, “Matt, I am with you all the way.”\n\nIn the months leading up to January 6, Matt Maddock consistently pushed Trump’s lie about the election. In early December 2020, Matt Maddock and other state GOP lawmakers in Michigan held a series of hearings seeking to validate unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud – prompting a personal visit from Giuliani.\n\nWhen the effort to convince state legislators in Michigan to block Biden’s electors ultimately failed, Maddock was among the GOP lawmakers from five states who sent a letter to Pence on January 5, urging him to delay certification of the electoral votes. Pence refused to go along with the plan.\n\nMeshawn Maddock is equally close to Trump and is still peddling the lie that the election was stolen.\n\nAlong with being an elector, she also helped organize buses to take GOP activists to Washington for protests around January 6 and took part in the march to the US Capitol. She later disavowed the violence that came after the march.\n\nMaddock was named co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party one month after January 6. But as she is gaining prominence, her role as a fake elector is also attracting legal scrutiny.\n\nAttorney General of Michigan Dana Nessel, center, is escorted to the entrance of the Michigan State Capitol on December 14, 2020 in Lansing, Michigan, on the day electors would meet to certify the electoral college vote.

But the internal debate shows that even some of Trump’s strongest allies were concerned about the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro speaks with people as he awaits a speech from U.S. President Joe Biden at Mack Truck Lehigh Valley Operations on July 28, 2021 in Macungie, Pennsylvania.

Biden brought it up at a news conference Wednesday when asked about his stalled voting-rights bills in Congress.\n\n“I never thought we would get into a place where we were talking about… what they tried to do this last time out – Send different electors to the state legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn’t win but the Republican candidate won,” Biden said. “I doubt that anyone thought that would happen in America in the 21st century, but it is happening.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden answers questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House on January 19, 2022. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe coordinated nature of these fake elector efforts and the rising power of Big Lie-promoters in Republican circles has concerned voting rights organizations across the country.\n\nNancy Wang, executive director of the Michigan-based Voters Not Politicians, said her group was founded in 2016 to address redistricting and voting access, but Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election spurred her group to focus on countering anti-democratic efforts at large.\n\n“This is existential. This about the very fundamental institutions of our government - whether we can vote at all, whether we have any power whatsoever,” Wang said. “It is a completely different time that we are facing in 2020 and 2022. It really feels urgent. It is a battle of a completely different kind. It is massive, it is coordinated at a national level. It is much more threatening.”", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Zachary Cohen Dan Merica", "Marshall Cohen", "Zachary Cohen", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/entertainment/johnny-depp-amber-heard-careers/index.html", "title": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: Can their careers survive the trial ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter six weeks of testimony in a defamation trial that has aired the good, bad and the very ugly of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s former relationship, the case is now in the hands of the jury.\n\nWhatever the verdicts in Depp’s $50 million suit and Heard’s $100 million countersuit, something else is true: The fate of their respective careers will be decided in the court of public opinion, according to Hollywood insiders.\n\nCNN spoke with six entertainment industry experts for this story, some of whom spoke on background to protect professional relationships.\n\nWhether fair or unfair, the wave of support Depp has received on social media during the trial – especially on TikTok – may serve him well going forward, one veteran publicist who has known Depp for years told CNN.\n\n“I wasn’t sure what to expect before he took the stand and if anything, I believe this has done nothing but help his public image,” the source said.\n\nAnother top Hollywood publicist, who hasn’t worked with either Depp or Heard, said neither of their images have fared well.\n\n“Both are highly dysfunctional.

She also accused Depp of sexual violence during their relationship.\n\nDepp claimed multiple times on the stand that he has never struck a woman, denied Heard’s allegation of sexual battery and called himself a victim of domestic abuse by Heard, which she denies.\n\nDepp and Heard met in 2009 on the set of their film “The Rum Diary” and were married from 2015-2016 before divorcing.\n\nPhotographs as well as audio and video recordings painted a picture of two people in a relationship with what was characterized as “mutual abuse” by Laurel Anderson, a clinical psychologist who worked with Depp and Heard in 2015 as their marriage counselor, in testimony played on April 14. (To illustrate how contentious this trial has been, the witness’s use of the term itself has spurred criticism.)\n\nEntertainment agent Darryl Marshak thinks film studios might – at least, initially – be hesitant to engage with the actors entangled in a controversy that has played out so publicly.\n\n“Robert Downey Jr. won an Academy Award and then aired his personal business out in the world and people kind of recoiled,” said Marshak, who has previously represented stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Hilary Swank. “I think Hollywood is a strange place. When you air your dirty laundry in front of the machine, the executives, all the people that make the parts move, they sort of recoil from a hot flame.”\n\nDepp claims a 2018 op-ed by Heard in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse” defamed him. He has starred in two films since the op-ed, which did not mention him by name, “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Minamata,” both independent films.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Every word of it is true': Heard speaks on op-ed after break in defamation trial 04:33 - Source: CNN\n\nHeard, whose countersuit claims she was defamed by an attorney for Depp who called her abuse allegations a “hoax,” will appear in the sequel to “Aquaman,” scheduled for release in 2023.\n\nMarshak said he believes Depp’s “unbelievable talent” will help him return to movie screens.\n\n“Hollywood is also forgiving and as it moves forward and this thing stops airing and Johnny is able to move fluidly back into the business. I think he’ll reemerge again,” he said. “Hollywood is a fickle place.”\n\nThe courtroom performance by the legal teams for Depp and Heard – a live-streamed trial watched by millions – may also shape industry perspective on the two stars.\n\n“Globally, people have seemingly become polarized by the trial, we have watched this unfold in the press prior to its culmination in the courtroom, ” Amanda K. Ruisi, founder and president of AKR Public Relations & AKR Ventures, told CNN.\n\nRuisi believes Depp’s representatives have been more effective.\n\n“Mr. Depp’s legal and strategic communications team have done an incredible job in delivering a consistent message in the courtroom and throughout the media, which I believe has helped corral the support from his fan base.”\n\nNot that Depp’s supporters needed the nudge. The scales of social media justice are heavily tipped in his favor, so much so that the imbalance has prompted headlines pondering the reason behind it. One writer for The Cut asked, “Here is a woman recounting, in agonizing detail, how an extremely famous man allegedly abused her. Why, in 2022, do so many people seem to hate her for it?”\n\nSociologist Nicole Bedera offered a few theories – both on Twitter and in an article for Harper’s Bazaar – about why both female survivors of domestic abuse and many women period have seemed to support Depp.\n\n“It can be scary – and for victims, re-traumatizing – for women to empathize with an abuse survivor. If violence really *is* everywhere and if it *feels* like it can happen to anyone, then a lot of women will start to worry that they will be next,” she wrote. “So is it surprising that a lot of women are coming to Depp’s defense? No. Not at all.”\n\nHeard has had her supporters, but notably fewer vocal ones than Depp – both in the entertainment business and in and around the courthouse.\n\nHeard’s former co-star David Krumholtz has come to her defense publicly, actress Ellen Barkin testified for her defense team and comedian Kathy Griffin wrote in response to a pretrial tweet from Heard, “I’m thinking about you and sending all the love.”\n\nFor two working actors, the question once court is adjourned is will producers send them scripts as reliably as onlookers have been sending tweets?\n\nFranchise futures in peril?\n\nThe crux of both Heard and Depp’s lawsuits rests in claims that their careers – specifically their futures in respective film franchises – have been adversely affected.\n\nDuring the past several weeks of testimony, Depp’s team has tried to prove that Depp, who portrayed Jack Sparrow in five films, was dropped from a potential sixth film in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise due to Heard’s op-ed.\n\nJohnny Depp in \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" Peter Mountain/Walt Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nJerry Bruckheimer, who produced the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films, told The Times that “the future is yet to be decided” regarding Depp’s involvement in a possible next installment.\n\nThe producer said that the creative team is “developing two ‘Pirates’ scripts” – one that would potentially have Margot Robbie as the lead and “one without” Robbie.\n\nThe last film was 2017’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.”\n\nIn a taped deposition played for the court, Depp’s former agent, Christian Carino, who began representing Depp in October 2016 and even represented Depp and Heard at the same time, testified that he believed accusations of domestic violence made by Heard against Depp cost the actor a paycheck that would have been worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd when an attorney for Heard pressed Carino on other issues Depp may have had while working on previous “Pirates” films, he dismissed them.\n\n“I’m aware of him being tardy but he’s been tardy on everything his entire life,” Carino said. “I think it’s troublesome to everybody, but everyone has learned how to produce a film to deal with it.”\n\nOther witnesses saw his behavior as more detrimental.\n\nTracey Jacobs, who testified in a recorded deposition and represented Depp for 30 years as his talent agent before being terminated, said as a witness that she was honest with Depp that showing up late consistently to sets and his behavior, including drug and alcohol use, was hurting his career.\n\n“His star had dimmed due to it getting harder to get him jobs given the reputation that he’d acquired due to his lateness and other things,” Jacobs testified. “People were talking and the question was out there about his behavior.”\n\nA Hollywood director, who hasn’t worked with Depp but has met him, told CNN that he doesn’t think Depp will ever helm another major franchise.\n\n“I believe that Johnny Depp will be able to be cast in various independent films because he still has significant name value and there’s an audience for him, however the studios will be more cautious because of insurance reasons and because of the potential to stop protection and they would be more concerned about public backlash as opposed to smaller independent companies,” he said.\n\nJason Momoa and Amber Heard in 2018's \"Aquaman.\" Warner Bros/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to Heard, the director believes the attention around the trial hasn’t helped her image.\n\nCurrently, there’s a petition to have Heard dropped from the upcoming “Aquaman” sequel, which has already been filmed and is in post-production. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThat likely won’t happen. But Walter Hamada, the head of DC Films, which produced “Aquaman,” testified that the creative team had concerns about Heard resuming her role in the franchise over a lack of chemistry with co-star Jason Momoa.\n\nHe also said the studio never planned to portray Heard as a co-lead in the second film and that Heard’s role was not reduced in the forthcoming film, titled “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nWhatever decision the jury renders, Juda Engelmayer, founder of Herald PR, who has represented celebrities like disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, told CNN that Depp’s time in court – which included quirky, meme-able moments involving doodling and jelly beans – has bolstered his image.\n\n“His testimony, whether true or an act, has caused a resurgence of fans who missed him,” he said. “For his reputation and career, studios see he still has a fan base,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I knew it was wrong': Amber Heard testifies in defamation trial 04:46 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for Heard, whose career was less established than Depp’s when their relationship and troubling accusations began, that’s harder to say, according to sources.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, before the drama with Depp came to light, Heard told Vanity Fair she was up for the ebbs and flows of an acting career.\n\n“Do you think you would have pursued it if you knew it was gonna be this much of a circus?” Heard was asked in a 2013 interview.\n\n“Absolutely,” Heard responded. “I love very much the struggle that you’re constantly…you’re constantly put in a state of fight or flight.

Wade, corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and, in some cases, their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.\n\nThe court’s decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling, which protected the federal, constitutional right to an abortion, is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America, leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon, state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nMillions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure, adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many, employers’ benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.\n\nIn response, corporations, some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states, are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup (C), Salesforce (CRM) and Match Group (MTCH) first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some, including Bumble and Lyft, also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women’s rights, such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent, and worry about the impact these states’ anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nHere are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) extended its financial support for “critical healthcare,” including abortions and gender-affirming care, to include coverage for travel expenses for such services, after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.\n\nApple\n\nThe company’s existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state, according to an Apple (AAPL) spokesperson.\n\nMeta\n\nThe tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement “to the extent permitted by law” for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services, according to a spokesperson. “We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,” the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nYelp\n\nYelp’s existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women, family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas and Oklahoma, which ban abortions after 6 weeks.\n\n“This ruling puts women’s health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we’ve made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe,” Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp (YELP), said in a statement Friday. “Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision, and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why this company will cover travel and health care for employees seeking an abortion 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDisney\n\nDisney (DIS) employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location, according to a company spokesperson.

CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a “crushing blow to reproductive rights” and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July, abortion will be included in the company’s health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far from home, according to spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti.\n\nNike\n\nThe sportswear company said in a statement that it covers travel and lodging expenses in situations where healthcare services are not available close to home, according to a statement Nike (NKE) released Friday.\n\n“No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage, to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility, surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions,” the statement reads.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion, according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly, Starbucks (SBUX) acting executive vice president of partner resources.\n\n“We all need to process this in our own way, and as you do, here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live, or what you believe, we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare,” Kelly said in the letter.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods\n\nFor employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access, Dick’s will provide up to $4,000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available, the company said in a statement Friday.

They were like, ‘This is not what that is, we have two amazing guys who are really young and like minded.’ … I just said I would love to invest in them.”\n\nAbraham Ancer, Mark Wahlberg and Aron Marquez Flecha Azul\n\nThe trio partnered during the coronavirus pandemic, with Wahlberg inking a deal last year as the principal investor. And yes, he did take a visit to the brand’s distillery in Jalisco, Mexico, which has been owned and operated by a local family since 1840.\n\n“I said I want to put my money where my mouth is and cut a big check and get involved with your brand and utilize all of my resources … everything that we have we are going to tap into and utilize to make sure this brand is as successful as possible.”\n\nFlecha Azul has five types of tequila: Blanco, Reposado, Añejo, Cristalino and Extra Añejo. It’s currently sold in California, Texas, Nevada and Georgia, and plans to launch nationwide later this year.\n\nFlecha Azul\n\nAncer said that having Wahlberg come on board was a “no-brainer.”\n\n“It just felt like it was meant to be. He tried Flecha Azul and loved it,” he said. Adding, “our focus was to bring a tequila that’s made the traditional way with no shortcuts. It is extremely important for me to honor my culture and the families that have dedicated their lives to tequila making.”\n\nA crowded space\n\nWhen it comes to celebrities and tequila, Wahlberg acknowledges that it’s a space that has been occupied by some of Hollywood’s heavyweights. George Clooney and Rande Gerber’s Casamigos sold to Johnnie Walker-owner Diageo in 2017 for up to $1 billion. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson launched Teremana, which last month announced it has sold over 600,000 nine-liter cases. Even Kendall Jenner has her own line, 818.\n\nWahlberg is unphased by the competition.\n\n“The space is growing thanks to guys like Dwayne who have created a lot of awareness and excitement,” Wahlberg said.\n\nBut that’s not stopping Wahlberg from heading for the top.\n\n“We’re coming for everybody’s spot … We plan on being the best because we have the best product out there. It’s the best value proposition for the customer,” he said.\n\nAdding, he’s down to host a tequila-off with Johnson and Clooney.\n\n“I’ve tasted their product, they haven’t tasted mine! Those guys know me very well, they know my competitive spirit!’”\n\nOff screen, Wahlberg has his hand in several businesses, including his line of fitness apparel, Municipal, his family’s “Wahlburger’s” burger chain and investing in fitness company F45 (FXLV).\n\n“If I was going to be doing anything in the spirits space that really reflected my upbringing, my childhood, it would be Irish Whiskey being an Irish Catholic from Boston. But my interest is really to support them and what they’ve created,” Walhberg said.\n\nWahlberg’s lifestyle\n\nFlecha Azul\n\nIf you follow Wahlberg on Instagram then you know about his passion for fitness and his early morning workout sessions know as the “4 AM Workout club.” He told CNN Business that tequila fits right into his regimen.\n\n“I was always a wine guy,” he said. “But there’s a lot more sugar, a lot more calorie intake. And to find out that I would have to do a lot less cardio at 50 years old and that tequila was probably the best thing for me to be drinking … when I tried Flecha I was like this is really special, so I’m much more a tequila guy now. But of course everything is in moderation.”\n\nMark Wahlberg/Instagram\n\nWahlberg, now an internationally known actor, first stepped on to the scene in the 1990s as a member of the rap group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. He broke into acting with a lead role in the film “Fear” in 1996 and went on to receive acclaim for his next gig as Dirk Diggler in 1997’s “Boogie Nights.”\n\nNow, more than two decades later, he’s been nominated for two Academy Awards, eight Emmy Awards and starred in movies like “The Departed,” “Ted,” and “The Fighter.”\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nHe said this past year has been especially tough.\n\n“It was easy for me to stay positive until I got Covid, and then I experienced a depression and sadness like I’ve never felt,” he said.\n\nHe said things took an ever darker turn after the death of his mother, Alma, last April while he was filming his latest project, a movie called “Father Stu.” But he channeled those emotions on screen.\n\n“I lost my mom during the film, even if you live to 100 it’s a very short life so to be able to not only understand that, accept that but embrace that. This is a movie about forgiveness and love, and there’s not a lot out of that in the world.” He calls the project, “the most important film that I’ve ever done.”\n\nWhether it’s movies, tequila or his passion for fitness, Wahlberg is certain about one thing.\n\n“I kind of stick to things I know and understand and am passionate about,” he said. “Everything is about people feeling good, looking good. All things I’m hands on in and I won’t get involved in a space unless I know there’s a very serious adult from that space really leading the charge and heading the business.”", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/birx-covid-book-silent-invasion/index.html", "title": "In new book, Birx describes how data failures, bureaucracy and ...", "text": "(CNN) Issues with data collection and testing, slow communication and interpersonal conflicts within the Trump administration hurt the initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, former White House Coronavirus Response Task Force Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx says in her new book, published Tuesday.\n\nThroughout the book, \"Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It's Too Late,\" Birx speaks to her struggle to get through to an administration unprepared for the pandemic and President Trump, who quickly chilled on her stark projections of the damage the virus could do.\n\n\"Any other president would have wanted to know just how bad things were going to get and what could be done to prevent the worst case,\" Birx wrote of her early days on the task force in 2020. \"Except, this wasn't any other president or any other White House. This was President Trump and the Trump White House. I was standing on constantly shifting sand, among political players I didn't know and a president who apparently liked his news served good and upbeat, or not at all.\"\n\nBirx levies critiques too against the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its initial reaction to the illness as flu-like and lack of clear division of duties among agencies. Birx attributed some of this to CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield's status as a \"political appointee\" in the Trump administration.\n\n\"The rank and file would question everything that came from Bob and this White House,\" she said of her difficulties getting CDC officials on board with acknowledging broad asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus.\n\nStill, as political messages drove out public health messages, Birx wrote, she and some of the doctors in the Covid-19 response formed a pact: If any were fired, Redfield, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn agreed they would all resign in protest.\n\n\"I was neither hoping to be fired nor willing to resign independent of the others being let go,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I didn't believe my departure would change anything for the better. Accusing the Trump administration of negligence wasn't going to suddenly produce a different response to the pandemic from them.\"\n\nThe optics of firing her would be bad, she wrote.\n\nAfter Birx told CNN's Dana Bash in August 2020 that the virus was \"extraordinarily widespread,\" Birx wrote, Trump called her and demanded the name of the person who booked the interview, saying \"That's it! Do you understand me? Never again! The virus is under control.\"\n\nAlthough they were making progress, she wrote, \"The president was wrong. We didn't have the virus under control.\"\n\nAside from a \"dysfunctional\" White House, the United States struggled to keep pace with the fast-moving virus, Birx wrote. Fixing the problems uncovered by the Covid-19 pandemic may help save the country from the next, she says.\n\nAddress inadequate data collection and analysis\n\n\"Data is everything in a pandemic,\" Birx writes in the book. \"Data shows your gaps; it shows where communities have an effective response; it lays bare the truth, where things are deteriorating and where they are better. It allows you to stay laser-focused and develop evidence-based policies. Without comprehensive data, you won't have a comprehensive response.\"\n\nBefore joining the Covid-19 response, Birx wrote, she thought US health officials were seeing data that she couldn't access. But once she arrived in March 2020, it became clear to Birx -- who had previously worked on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- that the country was \"dangerously behind the eight ball\" on data collection on the emerging coronavirus.\n\nBirx described a meeting in March at which the task force received a single double-sided page of data that \"summarized case data and deaths by state.\"\n\nIn 2020, she wrote, data in some states was often being sent by fax and then passed along to the CDC.\n\n\"How was this really happening? How in the world could we not have clear data at this point?\" she wondered.\n\nAll the US had, she said, was \"a static, partial thirty-thousand-foot awareness. I pressed the flats of my hands into my eyes and shook my head. I had expected something very different, but now I could see not only that the data-reporting structures that had taken years to build in Africa weren't present in the United States, but that we had days to get the same job done here.\"\n\nUnderstand that a new virus may behave differently\n\nBirx wrote that even before she signed on to the White House team, she suspected that asymptomatic spread was contributing to the quick rise in Covid-19, although the evidence was slim.\n\n\"After years of experience seeing asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic cases being ignored in tabulations, anytime I read a number indicating a confirmed case, I multiply that by a factor of between three and ten,\" she said.\n\nEarly on at least, the focus was on those with symptoms, much like in the case of the flu.\n\nBut the virus that causes Covid-19 is very different.\n\nThat became clear when cases surged in New York City, a dramatic rise that \"couldn't be explained by symptomatic spread alone.\"\n\n\"If there'd been any doubt before about the extent to which asymptomatic spread was a significant contributor to the rise in case numbers, the New York City numbers convinced the team that my estimate of at least 30-50 percent asymptomatic spread was likely accurate and possibly even conservative,\" Birx wrote. \"Even though the testing issues prevented us from having the quantity and type of data we needed, a preponderance of numerical evidence, the picture was crystal clear.\n\n\"For those of us in that tiny room, doubt had been replaced by a communal sense of dread,\" she said of the task force.\n\nDevelop tests early\n\nContributing to the lack of clear, granular data on Covid-19 and the misunderstanding of silent spread was a significant need for testing in the United States. The CDC's early test was flawed, putting the country weeks behind on testing, Birx wrote. Even then, public health labs weren't equipped to move fast and handle the volume the Covid-19 response would need.\n\nWriting about a meeting with American Covid-19 testing manufacturers early in her tenure, Birx said that learning that the White House had dragged its feet on meeting with manufacturers, on top of limited tests and slow test processing, represented a \"worst-case scenario.\"\n\n\"In later conversations, I asked one of the manufacturers critical to the production of high-throughput and point-of-care tests if anyone in the administration or from the CDC had called them in January and February 2020,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Their reply was that, in fact, it had been the other way around: the manufacturers were the ones calling the CDC to understand what it was doing and how they could help. The manufacturers were held at arm's length\" by the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. \"They were told their assistance wasn't needed,\" Birx wrote.\n\nLater on, Trump's rhetoric on testing shifted -- he suggested that the United States had high case numbers because it tested so many people -- but Birx said the task force was working rapidly to expand it, spending billions on tests and supplies and implementing serial testing in nursing homes and universities.\n\n\"At no time did anyone tell us to stop this acceleration in testing. The president was a master at saying one thing to appease his base while his administration did another in support of combating the virus,\" she wrote.\n\nPush for solutions before there's a problem\n\nBirx's book concludes with a list of \"critical issues\" to address in the US around pandemic response and preparedness. It includes clarity on how responsibilities are divided between agencies, ramped-up testing and diagnosis, improvements to CDC data collection and \"overarching\" improvements for public health coordination.\n\nSome of those changes are still needed to manage the current pandemic.\n\n\"One of the most important takeaways here is to not wait until the surge or the holidays are upon us,\" she wrote. \"We have learned that there are lulls in the outbreaks. During these interludes, we needed to expand testing access. We should have used that time to prepare for the next surge by getting as many Americans as possible to buy into making critical behavioral changes needed to protect their vulnerable family members.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLooking ahead, Birx wrote that the solutions can't be pushed into place only when there's an emergency.\n\n\"We don't need one set of standards and processes for improving public health of the country and another for pandemic preparedness -- they need to be integrated and utilized between pandemics to improve the health of the nation,\" she wrote.\n\n\"We need to stop just observing the problem and begin addressing the problem.\"", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/04/08/mlb-100-most-powerful-people/100172102/", "title": "The 100 most powerful people in MLB", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\n1. Rob Manfred\n\nA protégé of Hall of Fame Commissioner Bud Selig, Manfred has shown a radically different approach in his two years as baseball’s chief executive. While Selig was painfully slow adopting change, awaiting strong consensus among owners, Manfred is quick to make change. He is showing a strong willingness for innovation and a burning desire is to speed up the pace of play, marketing it to youth without damaging its fabric of being a timeless sport, or offending baseball’s conservative and traditional fan base.\n\n2. Dan Halem\n\nHalem is Manfred’s right-hand man, performing all of Manfred’s duties before he became commissioner. A brilliant man, he’s the point person on all of the labor, economic and legal fronts, and was the driving force on the new collective bargaining agreement and baseball’s Biogenesis drug investigation. He widely is viewed as Manfred’s successor if he stays in baseball.\n\n3. Tony Petitti\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nPetitti is the creative force in Manfred’s inner circle in baseball’s hierarchy as the chief operating officer. Petitti, the former executive vice president of CBS sports, created and developed the Major League Baseball Network. He also is the catalyst behind baseball’s vision of speeding up the pace of the game to engage younger fans and the viewing audience.\n\n4. Bill DeWitt\n\nDewitt has been CEO of the Cardinals since 1996, but has risen to considerable power under Rob Manfred, and is Manfred’s closest ally in ownership circles. He is a former chairman of the executive council and also a former chairman of the Commissioner’s succession committee that helped elect Manfred. Manfred, in fact, may not have been elected commissioner without DeWitt’s strong influence. He succeeds Jerry Reinsdorf as the most powerful owner in the game.\n\n5. Scott Boras\n\nStill – and probably always – the uber agent. Boras Corporation enjoyed $132.3 million in commissions last year, according to Forbes, and even as some of its legacy players retire – Mark Teixeira, Prince Fielder and others – the client list remains deep, relevant and lucrative. Bryce Harper will hit the market in two years; Kris Bryant may surpass whatever Harper fetches come 2021. Players love Boras for getting top dollar; ownership and front offices have no choice but to respect his clout, passion and knowledge of the industry and game.\n\n6. Bob Bowman\n\nThe longtime president and CEO of MLB’s uber-successful advanced media wing, Bowman has helped the league generate billions in income thanks in large part to a successful – if sometimes frustratingly territorial – online video product that governs and profits off all the sport’s streaming broadcast packages and highlights. Since the 2015 implementation of Statcast in all 30 MLB parks, MLBAM now tracks an overwhelming amount of raw on-field data to be synthesized by its teams, its broadcasts, and its team of in-house analysts.\n\n7. Tony Clark\n\nExecutive director, players association. Clark, now in his fourth season as head of the union, is the first former major leaguer to hold that position. In December he and MLB officials negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that extends through the 2021 season and increases the minimum player salary to $535,000 this year. The MLBPA has long been regarded as the strongest union in major pro sports, and baseball remains the only one among them without a salary cap.\n\n8. Terry McGuirk\n\nThe Braves’ CEO since 2001, McGuirk a powerful voice among baseball executives, while also having the ear of Manfred. The former Turner broadcasting executive maneuvered the stunning deal that led the Braves to move from downtown Atlanta to $672 million SunTrust Park, with a surrounding $452 million mixed-use development, without it being publicly known before an announcement.\n\n9. Casey Close\n\nHe helped keep Derek Jeter’s name out of blaring headlines for the better part of two decades, and now Close is making his own name by controlling much of the ever-lucrative pitching market. Close changed the game – at least for a while – by negotiating opt-out clauses into deals for Zack Greinke, Masahiro Tanaka and Clayton Kershaw. Greinke already cashed in, to the tune of a new $206.5 million deal after the 2015 season. Tanaka and Kershaw are up next the next two winters. The low-key approach combined with lucrative results will ensure blue-chip players arrive in the Excel Sports Management stable.\n\n10. Rob McGlarry\n\nPresident of MLB network, reporting directly to Bob Bowman. McGlarry, an executive at the network since it launched in 2009, has played an instrumental role in negotiating MLB’s broadcasting agreements since arriving in 2003.\n\n11. Bryce Harper\n\nHe’s supposedly second to Kris Bryant in fan recognition and likability among active major leaguers, but Harper’s relevance can’t be denied. He cast himself as the unofficial torch bearer for the expressive, occasionally brash young ballplayer with his “Make Baseball Fun Again” exhortation. The rare athlete who lived up to and perhaps exceeded the significant hype preceding him, Harper was an MVP by 22, and now boasts endorsements for almost every significant MLB corporate partner: Gatorade, T-Mobile and Under Armour, to name a few. After the 2018 season, it’s almost certain he will set a new standard for biggest contract. D.C.? New York? L.A.? Soon, it will be Harper making that call.\n\n12. Kevin Plank\n\nUnder Armour inked a deal in December that will have the sportswear company supplying Major League Baseball’s uniforms beginning in 2020. The company’s logo is set to feature on the front of jerseys once they take over, rather than the tiny logo on a sleeve as we have become accustomed to. MLB fan apparel has become a big part of Under Armour’s business, challenging Nike’s long-standing dominance. Under Armour also sponsors Clayton Kershaw and Bryce Harper, two of the most high-profile stars in the game.\n\n13. Eric Shanks\n\nHe’s the co-president and COO of the powerful Fox Sports Media Group, Major League Baseball’s largest broadcast rights holder, which annually produces the World Series. He has been only the third president of the company at the age of 38, believed to be the youngest leader of a broadcast network sports division.\n\n14. Joe Torre\n\nThe Hall of Fame manager and former star player brings and on-field and dugout perspective to his job as chief baseball officer, the main connection between the commissioner’s office and the teams and umpires in matters related to the playing of the game. Torre oversees discipline for on-field actions and has been involved in the implementation of instant replay and pace-of-play rules.\n\n15. Tom Ricketts\n\nThe Ricketts family owns the Cubs, and Tom is the chairman of a board of directors that also includes siblings Pete, Laura and Todd. Under the Ricketts’ ownership, the Cubs have embarked on a $550 million renovation of Wrigley Field and its surroundings that is still ongoing. The product on the field has also been upgraded, as confirmed by last year’s World Series championship – the franchise’s first since 1908. In the pipeline: A possible Cubs TV network.\n\n16. Theo Epstein\n\nWhen you build potential dynasties in Boston and Chicago, and break century-long “curses” for the Red Sox and Cubs, it puts you in a different stratosphere, even in an ra where front-office executives are idolized to an extent. Epstein, president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has broken even further away from the pack of genius GMs, building not just a champion but, by all appearances, a perennial powerhouse in Wrigleyville. Ricketts gave him a reported $50 million deal to stick around; then-President Obama suggested he run the Democratic National Committee, an East Room joke that had more than a shred of truth to it. Still just 43, Epstein and his trusted lieutenants will almost assuredly keep the Cubs humming, but the baseball industry – and beyond – can’t help but ponder his next move.\n\n17. Brian Seeley\n\nSeeley is MLB’s top investigative cop and a former assistant U.S. attorney. He has a prosecutor’s mindset and a rich legal background. In 2014, he led the investigative unit that exposed the Biogenesis doping scandal -- one of the most extensive drug investigations in sports history -- that resulted in 14 player suspensions.\n\n18. Hal Steinbrenner\n\nFor a few years after George Steinbrenner ceded control of the Yankees to his sons in 2008, it appeared the brash and outspoken Hank Steinbrenner might carry on the family’s tradition of hands-on, front-facing, controversy-courting ownership. But Hal Steinbrenner, by reputation the far more reserved brother, seems instead to be guiding the club toward an unlikely pragmatism now culminating in the club’s fruitful youth movement. The new-look Yankees seem primed to foster a core of good young players apt to complement whatever big fish they inevitably lure in free agency in the coming offseasons, all while still raking in significant revenue from the YES Network.\n\n19. Mark Walter\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers owner. Walter, a Chicago financier, and his investment group bought the Dodgers for a record $2.15 billion in 2012, then parlayed that purchase into a $8.3 billion TV contract. The Dodgers finished second in Walter’s first year as owner and have won four consecutive NL West crowns since then, though they’re still seeking their first World Series appearance since 1988.\n\n20. Jerry Reinsdorf\n\nReinsdorf, who owns the Chicago White Sox and Bulls, is one of only three men who have owned sports franchises that won championships in multiple sports. Reinsdorf, who has owned the White Sox since 1981, was former Commissioner Bud Selig’s closest ally and easily the most powerful owner in the sport during Selig’s reign. He still wields considerable power among owners, but his attempt to have someone else succeed Selig instead of Manfred failed.\n\n21. John Henry\n\nThe 67-year-old investor is the principal owner of the group that purchased the Boston Red Sox in 2002, two years before the team ended its celebrated “Curse of the Bambino” by winning the World Series for the first time since 1918. Since then, the Red Sox have won twice more and are ranked third on Forbes’ list of the most valuable franchises – with a value in 2016 of $2.3 billion. Henry’s reach also extends to the media that cover the Red Sox. His Fenway Sports Group owns 80% of the New England Sports Network (NESN), which broadcasts Red Sox games. He also owns The Boston Globe.\n\n22. Derek Jeter\n\nLong the face of baseball and a future first-ballot Hall of Famer, the telegenic former Yankee shortstop still carries a lot of weight in the sport. His online media outlet, The Players’ Tribune, offers baseball's biggest stars a direct means of communication with fans that extends far beyond social-media character limits. And Jeter, who earned $265 million in salary across his career plus millions more in endorsements, may soon make his long-held dreams of ownership come true, as he’s reportedly part of an ownership group vying to purchase the Miami Marlins.\n\n23. John Skipper\n\nPresident, ESPN. Skipper greenlighted the current eight-year, $5.6 billion deal with MLB that extends both sides’ partnership through 2021. Though ESPN televises three games a week during the regular season, the network has become a minor presence in the postseason, with rights only to one of the wild-card games. As ESPN feels the financial strain of cord-cutting, its relationship with baseball in future years will bear watching.\n\n24. Stuart Sternberg\n\nHe owns one of MLB’s smaller fish – the Tampa Bay Rays – and voted against the most recent collective bargaining agreement, calling it a missed opportunity “to address the extraordinary and widening competitive gap that exists on-field between higher and lower revenue clubs.” But the Rays’ stadium situation is untenable, everyone knows it and the franchise, while not a free agent, has a greater potential for mobility than any other. Tampa Bay? St. Petersburg? Montreal? The first two are far more likely, but the twists in their venue saga bear watching as 2027 – when their lease at Tropicana Field expires – approaches.\n\n25. James Andrews\n\nThe foremost authority in the elbow-reconstruction procedure known as Tommy John surgery, Andrews has extended the careers of hundreds of pitchers. He would like to prevent at least that many from requiring the operation. Andrews has spoken out about the dangers of overusing youth pitchers and co-authored a set of guidelines known as Pitch Smart to help them avoid injuries.\n\n26. Larry Baer\n\nBaer was one of the key figures in keeping the San Francisco Giants from moving to Tampa Bay in the early 1990s and in getting their privately financed ballpark built; he has since ascended to CEO. The club’s current streak of 489 sellouts is the majors’ longest. The Giants have won three World Series under Baer’s stewardship while becoming innovators in areas such as ticket pricing and player rest.\n\n27. Andrew Friedman\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations since 2014, Friedman first rose to prominence in baseball when he was named the Tampa Bay Rays general manager in 2005 at age 28. His analytic approach turned the perennial losers into a playoff team for the first time in franchise history when they reached the World Series in 2008. With the Dodgers, he has assembled what could be described as an all-star front office that includes former MLB GMs Josh Byrnes (San Diego) and Farhan Zaidi (Oakland). Friedman now has big-city dollars to mix with his baseball savvy: For the past three seasons, the Dodgers have had baseball’s largest payroll.\n\n28. Jeffrey Loria\n\nFive years after opening a stadium made possible by strong-arming area taxpayers, the Miami Marlins owner is now hard at work on a multi-billion dollar exit strategy: Selling the club. Numerous bidders have reportedly emerged for the club, including names such as Derek Jeter and the Kushner family. Loria had a huge hand in baseball’s exit from Montreal and solidifying the Marlins’ future in South Florida. Now, he’ll hold all the cards in determining who will steer the franchise in the future.\n\n29. Billy Bean\n\nStill one of only two former MLB players to publicly come out as gay, Bean now serves as the league’s Ambassador for Inclusion. In that role, Bean tours clubhouses every year to engage with players in the hopes of fostering environments more accepting than those he confronted during his playing days in the late 1980s. Bean’s visits have come with some controversy – most notably when then-Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy said he “disagree(s) with the (gay) lifestyle” during spring training in 2015 – but Bean persists in shepherding the league into the 21st century. The results are already evident, as the club has outlawed cross-dressing as a rookie hazing ritual.\n\n30. Jane Forbes Clark\n\nHall of Fame chairman. The granddaughter of Hall of Fame founder Stephen C. Clark, she’s a major mover and shaker in Cooperstown, N.Y., which swells to several times its size every year at the end of July for the induction ceremonies. She also serves as a liaison between the Hall and the players who return yearly to welcome new inductees.\n\n31. Bill James\n\nThe impact of James as a baseball writer, historian and statistician cannot be overstated in the game we know today. He was the first to use what’s now known as “sabermetrics” (a term he coined from the Society for American Baseball Research’s acronym) as a new way of looking at and measuring the game – often in direct opposition to conventional wisdom at the time. His annual self-published Baseball Abstract spawned a new generation of analytically minded sportswriters. He is currently a Senior Baseball Operations Advisor for the Boston Red Sox, a position he’s held since 2002.\n\n32. David Ortiz\n\nEven in retirement, Big Papi remains an influential figure. Ortiz still appears in national TV commercials and he’s revered by both American and Latin players, especially those from his native Dominican Republic. He’s baseball’s quintessential ambassador, and he has the commissioner’s ear.\n\n33. Mark Shapiro\n\nShapiro, president and CEO of the Toronto Blue Jays, is one of the most powerful disciples of Atlanta Braves vice president John Schuerholz. He was a fixture in the Cleveland Indians organization for 24 years, and groomed such GMs and executives as Chris Antonetti and Mike Chernoff of Cleveland, Ross Atkins of Toronto, Neal Huntington of Pittsburgh, Derek Falvey of Minnesota, David Stearns of Milwaukee and Mike Hazen of Arizona. He has been so instrumental in the hiring of new GMs that MLB cut ties with search firm Korn Ferry.\n\n34. Mike Trout\n\nThe best player in baseball by far, Trout enters his sixth full big-league season with two MVP awards, five All-Star nods and countless statistical accomplishments on his resume, but a bafflingly low Q rating only partly explained by the Angels’ middling performances in 2015 and 2016. At this point, Trout’s stature as an on-field great is so certain and so widely recognized throughout the sport that he could easily generate headlines with even the mildest of opinions, but Trout, for now, seems content to just be incredibly good at baseball.\n\n35. Brodie Van Wagenen\n\nSports management with a side of glitz. Van Wagenen, co-head of Creative Artists Agency’s baseball division, teamed with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation for two years, during which he negotiated a $240 million contract for Robinson Cano with the Seattle Mariners. He also managed to fetch, over the course of two off-seasons, $137.5 million for Yoenis Cespedes despite an iffy market for the slugger after the 2015 season. And he’s also the man who deftly brought you Tim Tebow, baseball player.\n\n36. Fred Wilpon\n\nWilpon’s involvement in Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and ensuing financial crisis made the Mets a laughingstock in the early part of this decade. Things have calmed down since and the team is winning, thanks in large part to the Wilpons’ patience with general manager Sandy Alderson. Fans still call for Wilpon’s ousting, but he has done all the right things in recent years and the Mets are now dominating back pages in New York for the right reasons.\n\n37. Neal ElAttrache\n\nThe team doctor for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Rams is known as the orthopedic surgeon to the stars, having operated on the likes of Kobe Bryant and Zack Greinke, as well as actors Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger (the last two on the same day). ElAttrache is also an expert on Tommy John surgery.\n\n38. Kris Bryant\n\nPerhaps the most prominent and most promising young star on a Cubs roster chock full of them, the bright-eyed Bryant represents a rare Northside player who has only known success: The Cubs won 97 games in Bryant’s first big-league season in 2015 then, you may have heard, won 103 games and the World Series in his sophomore year. With teammate Anthony Rizzo, he forms half of a formidable and marketable set of middle-of-order sluggers known to adoring Cubs fans as “Bryzzo.” Off the diamond, his matinee-idol looks are on display as a pitchman for Express.\n\n39. Clayton Kershaw\n\nBaseball’s highest-paid player at $33 million a season, Kershaw is a three-time Cy Young Award winner and generally regarded as the game’s top pitcher. Kershaw, 29, can opt out of his seven-year, $215 million contract after next season, setting up the possibility of a bidding war for his services.\n\n40. Kim Ng\n\nThe highest-ranking woman in baseball, Ng, as senior VP of baseball operations, oversees MLB’s international operations. Ng was an assistant general manager with the Yankees and Dodgers and interviewed for the Los Angeles GM post before joining the MLB office in 2011. Her name has surfaced in connection with other GM jobs, but so far no female has been hired for such a post.\n\n41. Bud Selig\n\nSelig, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer, perhaps was the most powerful commissioner in baseball history. He led baseball into its golden era where revenues are expected to exceed $10 billion. He’s the Commissioner Emeritus for three more years, and still has a powerful voice among long-time owners. Manfred, who was Selig’s protégé, does not have daily interaction with him, but utilizes Selig’s strengths when needing support from certain ownership factions.\n\n42. David Levy\n\nAt the end of the 2012 season, Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting System, brokered an eight-year TV deal with MLB that, combined with deals with ESPN and Fox, will deliver a combined $12.4 billion. Turner will retain exclusive rights to one League Championship Series each year.\n\n43. Joe Garagiola Jr.\n\nThe long title - MLB senior VP of standards and on-field operations - mostly means Garagiola, son of the late player and broadcaster of the same name, hands out discipline for on-field incidents. Garagiola served as the Arizona Diamondbacks’ general manager from 1997-2005.\n\n44. John Fisher\n\nFisher, the son of The Gap founders, has been the Oakland Athletics’ majority owner since 2005, but he remained on the background until replacing Lew Wolff as managing partner in November. With the NFL’s Raiders headed to Las Vegas, the A’s appear primed to finally get a new stadium in Oakland.\n\n45. Gary Green\n\nGreen, a clinical professor at UCLA, is Major League Baseball’s medical director. He has been the chief consultant to MLB on anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs since 2003, and helped shape baseball’s powerful drug-testing program.\n\n46. Andy MacPhail\n\nHe laid the foundation for the Baltimore Orioles’ current success – Adam Jones, Manny Machado and Buck Showalter all bear his fingerprints – and now holds a ton of cards in Philadelphia, where he’s president of baseball operations. The Phillies have just $28 million committed beyond 2018, when perhaps the greatest free agent class in baseball history hits the market. Their payday from a 25-year, $2.5 billion local TV contract will rise every year. Translation: The Phillies will be ready to strike, and soon.\n\n47. Shohei Otani\n\nBy changing the rules governing international signees in the new collective bargaining agreement, MLB and the MLBPA likely cost the league a couple of years’ worth of the services of one of the sport’s most fascinating players. Japan’s best starting pitcher and one of its top sluggers as a part-time DH, Otani considered entering the American ranks out of high school but signed with Nippon Ham of the NPB when the club promised him the opportunity to be a two-way player. Unless MLB creates some form of loophole in the CBA, its fans might not see Otani before the 2020 season. The ankle injury that kept him out of the 2017 WBC also kept Otani off the mound for the start of the NPB season, but he opened the campaign by going 10-for-20 with four doubles and two homers as a designated hitter. When he does come to the USA, the bidding war for his services – and how the winning team may deploy him – will be fascinating.\n\n48. Ted Lerner\n\nAs the Nationals’ owner, Lerner is going to be in the spotlight as Bryce Harper’s free agency approaches. The organization has recently committed $385 million for Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, but will Lerner foot the bill for Harper’s sure-to-be mega deal? He has already been the benefactor of four $100 million+ contracts since 2010.\n\n49. Sean Forman\n\nThe founder of Baseball-Reference.com, the most complete source of baseball statistics on the Internet. MLB executives, as well as writers, broadcasters and fans rely heavily on the database Forman – and his company Sports Reference -- has collected and maintained since 2000. One of the site’s major contributions to the sabermetric revolution is its efforts to roll all of a player’s contributions into a single, quantifiable number: Wins Above Replacement (WAR).\n\n50. Pedro Martinez\n\nThe second Dominican elected to the Hall of Fame, Martinez has remained a visible presence in the game as an analyst for TBS and the MLB Network and as special assistant for the Boston Red Sox. He also released an autobiography in 2015, the year he entered the Hall. Martinez is the pitching version of David Ortiz, a widely admired figure in the U.S. and Latin America.\n\nGallery: Most powerful people in MLB\n\n51. Ken Rosenthal\n\nKnown to the general public as the insightful but unassuming bow-tied dugout reporter and interviewer for Fox’s MLB broadcasts, Rosenthal doubles as a deadly accurate and accountable must-follow source for inside-baseball scoops and trends. Nicknamed “Robothal” in some circles for his tireless and comprehensive reporting, especially before the trade deadline and during the winter meetings, Rosenthal smoothly negotiates the contemporary media landscape across multiple platforms despite output that reflects a dogged pursuit of information.\n\n52. Jeff Idelson\n\nPresident Baseball Hall of Fame. Idelson oversees daily operations of a museum attended by about 300,000 visitors a year and gathers memorabilia to add to the shrine’s collection. Idelson represents the Hall at international events and maintains close contact with players who have been inducted.\n\n53. Joe West\n\n‘Country Joe’ is the president of the World Umpires Association. He spent 39 seasons as an umpire, in which he umpired six Word Series and two All-Star Games. In 2014, West helped negotiate a five year labor agreement with the league and get the largest umpiring contract in baseball history.\n\n54. Jim Crane\n\nCrane, one of baseball’s newest owners as chairman of the Houston Astros, quickly is gaining power and influence. He purchased the Astros for $680 million in 2011, and agreed to move his team to the American League in 2013. The franchise now is worth in excess of $2 billion while becoming a power in the American League.\n\n55. Manny Machado\n\nThere’s a case to be made that the Orioles infielder is already the best player in the game. The 24-year-old infielder is a once-in-a-generation talent, and should go toe-to-toe with Harper for the biggest contracts in MLB history when they are both free agents after the 2018 season. Machado may not currently have the name recognition of Trout and Harper, but that’s going to change as rumors begin to swirl ahead of his free agency.\n\n56. Brian Cashman\n\nClosing in on 20 years as general manager of the New York Yankees, Cashman’s influence continues to grow years after gaining greater autonomy from Tampa-based forces in the organization. Under his watch, the Yankees have won seven American League pennants and five World Series titles, and thanks to his maneuvers last year, are positioned to combine young, cheap talent with big-money acquisitions.\n\n57. Jerry Ford\n\nPerfect Game USA began as a small outfit in Iowa designed to provide exposure to baseball players in an area not traditionally mined for prospects. Two decades later, Ford’s local project has ballooned into a multi-million dollar national powerhouse. Its year-round travel ball events are a must-stop for scouts and collegiate evaluators – and for parents hungry for their kids to get drafted or receive scholarships. Perfect Game estimated that 37 2015 major league All-Stars were alums of its events; its influence figures to grow, although it has received criticism for perpetuating the year-round travel ball culture that might possibly compromise the health of pitching arms.\n\n58. Joe Maddon\n\nMaddon is so highly regarded that the Cubs hired him after the 2014 season when their managerial job wasn’t even vacant. He’s quirky and unconventional, doing things as a manager that the rest of the league ends up trying to imitate. Aside from leading the Cubs to their first World Series in 108 years, he turned the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays into a perennial in the late 2000s. His glasses are by far the most recognizable feature among managers and the way he commands a microphone is unrivaled.\n\n59. Tony Reagins\n\nReagins, the former GM of the Los Angeles Angels, is the leader of MLB’s entire youth program as MLB’s senior vice president. The role is vitally importantly to Manfred’s challenge of luring youngsters back to the game, particularly within minority groups, where only 7% of opening-day rosters are comprised of African-Americans.\n\n60. Cal Ripken\n\nA deity in the state of Maryland for decades, Ripken has become even more influential in the sport since retiring in 2001. The 56-year-old is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, which seeks to promote baseball at a grassroots level organization through tournaments and camps. Ripken has called postseason games on TBS for the last four years and features on the studio show as well. He has purchased three minor league teams including the Aberdeen IronBirds, who he relocated from Utica to play at Ripken Stadium, now a landmark overlooking I-95 in northern Maryland.\n\n61. Pat O’Conner\n\nPresident of the minor leagues, O’Conner has spent 33 years in professional baseball, including the last 23 years in the minors. The minor leagues have never been more profitable under his reign, drawing 42 million fans in 2014 and 2015, while garnering unprecedented attention to its prospects.\n\n62. David Appelman\n\nThe creator of Fangraphs, a website that not only features player and team statistics, but analytical articles and charts as well. The writing at Fangraphs has not gone unnoticed by MLB front offices looking to add more analytically minded and data-driven viewpoints to their decision-making process as a number of the site’s former writers have been hired by MLB teams.\n\n63. David Ross\n\nHow does a 40-year-old retired former backup catcher become one of baseball’s most well-known ambassadors? Ross won World Series rings with the Red Sox in 2013 and the Cubs in 2016 and developed a reputation as one of baseball’s most respected clubhouse leaders during his tenure in the league, but Ross made his biggest star turn when he became the first baseball player to compete on Dancing With The Stars. He’ll remain involved with the Cubs as a special assistant in 2017, and will also serve as an on-air analyst at ESPN this season. A book and a movie are forthcoming, along with an influential future in the sport seemingly of his choosing.\n\n64. Peter Angelos\n\nTwelve years after the Washington Nationals moved to his backyard, the Baltimore Orioles owner still holds many of the cards in the region, thanks to an ongoing dispute regarding revenue distribution of the TV network that both clubs jointly own and operate. How deep is the enmity? The Washington Post reported that when the Orioles decided to trade a struggling Jake Arrieta in 2013, the club refused to entertain offers from the Nationals.\n\n65. David Dombrowski\n\nDombrowski has over 35 years as an executive in baseball and has been the general manager or vice president of baseball operations for four different franchises – the Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers and currently the Boston Red Sox. Dombrowski, who built the 1997 Marlins that won the World Series, is powerful in brokering deals and not afraid of the players he gives up – and now has more potent financial resources than ever in Boston.\n\n66. Jason Robins\n\nThe CEO of Boston-based DraftKings, one of the two major daily fantasy sports companies in the USA. Since 2015, DraftKings has had an exclusive sponsorship as the official daily fantasy game of MLB and as an official partner with 27 of the 30 MLB teams. DraftKings and its chief rival FanDuel (which have reached an agreement to merge in late 2017) have a major impact on the way MLB fans watch the game. And as fantasy sports and gambling become less taboo in the eyes of the four major sports leagues, its influence only figures to increase.\n\n67. David Beirne\n\nBeirne is a co-founder of Fantex, an investing platform that sells shares in \"tracking stocks\" tied to pro athletes. The rising company has lured several major leaguers to invest in the athlete stock exchange, which pays the athlete a one-time fee and in return gets a percentage stake in all of his future earnings.\n\n68. Bob Tewksbary\n\nHitting’s aerial revolution is in full swing, and Tewksbary is perhaps its most significant leader. A former minor leaguer turned hitting coach in New Hampshire, Tewksbary rode to prominence thanks to his work with Josh Donaldson, who went from fringe major leaguer to All-Star and MVP after adopting Tewksbary’s principles of movement. Now, a gaggle of major leaguers come to him in Florida every winter, and it’s as much players like Matt Joyce – who solidified a flagging career after working with Tewksbary – who give him and other coaches in this space their influence.\n\n69. Ken Williams\n\nWilliams, along with Michael Hill of the Miami Marlins, is the highest-ranking African-American team executive in baseball. The Chicago White Sox executive vice president became only the second African-American GM to win a World Series when the White Sox won their first World Series since 1917 in 2005. He has tremendous influence in baseball’s African-American community.\n\n70. Sandy Alderson\n\nA high-ranking baseball executive for more than three decades now, Alderson mentored Billy Beane in Oakland long before he took over the Mets' helm in 2010. Now 69, Alderson has pulled the New York franchise out of its Madoff-complicated rebuilding phase while collecting and developing a deep arsenal of fireballing starting pitchers. During his time working in the MLB commissioner's office from 1998 to 2005, Alderson helped the league combat the corruption that riddled the amateur free-agent process in the Dominican Republic.\n\n71. Jessica Mendoza\n\nThe Sunday Night Baseball platform is a powerful one, and manning it in a groundbreaking fashion will only boost Mendoza’s profile. The first woman to serve as a permanent lead analyst on a national baseball broadcast, Mendoza’s influence will rise as a generation grows up on her voice, and as MLB continues to nurture women and girls as fans. It also doesn’t hurt that she’s excellent at her job, fluent in the modern mechanics and metrics that continue to re-shape the game.\n\n72. Nigel Eccles\n\nThe CEO of FanDuel, the largest daily fantasy sports site in the USA. FanDuel and DraftKings have a combined 5 million users.\n\n73: Rachel Robinson\n\nRobinson is the matriarch of the Civil Rights Movement, the wife of the late Jackie Robinson. Robinson, 94, is revered throughout the industry, and really, the world. She founded the instrumental Jackie Robinson foundation, which has reached over 22 million students and 2.9 million educators. Their daughter, Sharon, is now the educational consultant for MLB.\n\n74. Ron Fowler\n\nFowler, co-owner of the San Diego Padres, emerged as a power broker in MLB when Fowler was appointed by Manfred to be chairman of the labor committee during their collective bargaining agreement. He also was selected in January to baseball’s executive council. He quickly has become entrenched as one of Manfred’s most trusted owners.\n\n75. Scott Cutler\n\nAs president of StubHub, Cutler and his group have a significant impact on how tickets are sold, distributed and – perhaps most notably – re-sold. StubHub has an exclusive deal as MLB’s secondary-market seller, and also has arrangements with a significant number of individual clubs. In 2016, StubHub reached a reported $100 million deal with the New York Yankees, who had opted out of the original deal with MLB.\n\n76. Joe Buck\n\nThe Fox Sports broadcaster, 47, has called more World Series (18) and All-Star Games (17) on TV than any play-by-play announcer in history. He succeeded his father, Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Buck, as the television voice of the St. Louis Cardinals before moving to Fox full-time. Perhaps more than any other broadcaster, Buck’s presence at any MLB event signifies it’s an important one.\n\n77. Randy Marsh\n\nMarsh, a longtime ump now serving as the league’s director of umpires, must guide the sport’s officials through challenges unknown to their predecessors, brought upon by the explosion of technology. The ever-evolving replay review process, facilitated and necessitated by widespread use of high-definition slow-motion replay, draws attention to the performance of an umpiring corps that typically makes a goal out of remaining unnoticed. Now Marsh faces a small but growing call for computers to replace humans in calling balls and strikes – the long-awaited “robot umps” – precipitated, certainly, by the ubiquity of pitch-tracking graphics on MLB broadcasts.\n\n78. Albert Pujols\n\nA three-time MVP with the St. Louis Cardinals, Pujols is midway through a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels that should afford him the chance to chase some hallowed milestones. Pujols, 37, is nine home runs short of reaching 600 for his career. Though slowed by age and injuries in recent years, Pujols hit a combined 71 homers the last two seasons.\n\n79. John Mozeliak\n\nThe man behind baseball's most consistently competitive roster, Mozeliak is in his 10th full season as the Cardinals' GM and looking for his tenth winning club in that span. One of his former aides, Jeff Luhnow, now runs the Houston Astros. Another, Chris Correa, is now banned for life from baseball for hacking the Houston Astros.\n\n80. Buck Showalter\n\nAlways a respected baseball man, Showalter has reignited his influence by deftly managing the Baltimore Orioles to three postseason berths in the past five seasons. Working closely with GM Dan Duquette on roster machinations, Showalter is well-equipped to take on almost any job in baseball operations. He figures to be in high demand when his contract in Baltimore expires after 2018.\n\n81. Buster Olney\n\nAnother two-platform powerhouse, Olney is the Peter Gammons of the digital era, with a consistent presence on ESPN and a prolific output of influential online content.\n\n82. Tom Tango\n\nPseudonym of the co-author of a groundbreaking 2007 sabermetric work, The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, the enigmatic Tango has maintained his own sabermetric website and served as a consultant for several major league teams. In 2016, MLB Advanced Media hired him to help develop new ways of measuring and calculating data using its new Statcast technology. Among his most recently created Statcast metrics: barreled ball and defensive catch probability rates.\n\n83. Billy Beane\n\nHe’ll never be forgotten as the revolutionary who shook baseball evaluation and front office management to its core. Yet his loyalty to the Oakland A’s has ensured he wields less clout than those who followed in his footsteps, such as the Dodgers’ Friedman. Still, with an ownership stake in the club and an enduring name recognition to casual fans thanks to Moneyball, Beane will always remain relevant.\n\n84. Lucas Herscovici\n\nVice president of consumer connections for Anheuser-Busch InBev, maker of Budweiser and its line of beers. Herscovici’s name may not resonate with fans, but the company he represents certainly does. Herscovici oversees A-B InBev’s sports-sponsorship deals, including the one with MLB, a longtime partner which ensures Bud’s products and logo are in the background of every clubhouse celebration.\n\n85. Alex Rodriguez\n\nThe 41-year-old has the highest career earnings of any player in history, totaling more than $400 million on salary alone and is back in America’s good graces following his PED suspension in 2014. Since retiring last season, Rodriguez has become a fixture on Fox’s studio shows, and is already one of the more influential baseball pundits. A-Rod serves as a special instructor for the Yankees and is going to get a lot of credit for helping the organization’s promising young hitters. His new relationship with Jennifer Lopez is once again increasing his brand awareness outside of baseball.\n\n86. Arte Moreno\n\nLos Angeles Angels owner: Moreno purchased the then-Anaheim Angels in 2003 and changed their name to expand their appeal. Moreno has spent aggressively on players and has been rewarded with attendance totals of more than 3 million every year since he arrived. After reaching the playoffs five times in Moreno’s first seven seasons, the Angels have gotten there once in seven years.\n\n87. Justine Siegal\n\nThe first woman to serve as a coach for a major league team, Siegal helms Baseball For All, a non-profit that aims to expand girls’ participation in baseball. In 2015, Siegal spent two weeks as a coach at the Oakland Athletics’ instructional league. Next week, Major League Baseball will host its first girls’ baseball tournament in conjunction with Jackie Robinson Day in Los Angeles, featuring a large group of Baseball for All alums. As MLB aims to nurture growth among youth players, Siegal will be a key figure in tapping into the girls’ market.\n\n88. Max Scherzer\n\nHe has money - $215 million coming to him through 2021 – talent, smarts and charisma. Scherzer, the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner, remains one of the game’s most dominant pitchers and brighter mound minds. He was also excellent in postseason work for Fox Sports and has served on various MLB advisory committees.\n\n89. Terry Francona\n\nA two-time World Series-winning manager in Boston, and now a pennant-winning skipper in Cleveland. Francona’s wizardry in guiding the pitching-thin Indians to Game 7 of the World Series reminded the baseball world he’s one of its great minds and charismatic leaders.\n\n90. Mike Rizzo\n\nFive seasons after the controversial decision to shut down Stephen Strasburg in early September and hold the ace out of the postseason, the Nationals' president and GM can boast a strong working relationship with super agent Scott Boras -- who represents Nats stars like Strasburg, Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer -- and the type of budget necessary to pursue Boras' marquee players in free agency. The seven-year, $175 million extension Strasburg signed with Washington last season bucked a trend of big-name Boras clients eschewing extensions for free agency, and fuels some hope Rizzo and the Nats can do something similar for Harper.\n\n91. Giancarlo Stanton\n\nIf only his body would stop betraying him, Stanton would be much higher on this list. The home run remains baseball’s sexiest currency, and in the Statcast era, it is Stanton who clouts the sport’s mightiest shots. Not afraid to expose himself – be it participating in the Home Run Derby or posing in ESPN The Magazine’s Body issue – Stanton also has a $325 million contract. And he can opt out of that contract after the 2020 season.\n\n92. Sheldon Adelson\n\nWhat does the Las Vegas casino magnate have to do with baseball? Well, nothing at the moment. But the NFL and NHL’s Vegas entries only prove what Commissioner Rob Manfred said in February: Las Vegas is a “viable” market. While perhaps only the Tampa Bay Rays might eventually be viewed as a possible relocation candidate, Manfred has not shied away from expansion talk. And the road to Vegas often runs through Adelson, who has a net worth of $32.2 billion and was poised to finance the Raiders’ new stadium there.\n\n93. Barry Bonds\n\nBaseball’s all-time home run leader has become a far more likable public figure since his playing days ended. Baseball as a whole is warming up to Bonds as he rebuilds his legacy after the BALCO scandal. Considered a Hall of Fame longshot not long ago, Bonds’ stock is rising, getting 53.8% of the vote this year – still well short of the required 75%, but way up from the 34.7% he received in 2014. Bonds was the Marlins’ hitting coach in 2016, and quietly works with hitters of all stripes.\n\n94. John Schuerholz\n\nSchuerholz, the Atlanta Braves vice chairman who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer, is considered one of the greatest baseball executives in baseball history. He led the Kansas City Royals and Atlanta Braves to World Series titles. He was perhaps the most influential leader among team executives during former Commissioner Bud Selig’s watch, and still is on several of Manfred’s committees.\n\n95. Jeff Kearney\n\nAs head of Gatorade’s U.S. sports marketing, Kearney heads a division that is integral in determining which players will extend their brand through the popular sports drink. For now, it’s Bryce Harper on Gatorade’s Mount Rushmore with the likes of Serena Williams, Cam Newton and Lionel Messi.\n\n96. Miguel Cabrera\n\nA surefire Hall of Famer if he stopped playing today, Cabrera has won two MVP awards and four batting titles. In 2012 he became the first player since 1967 to claim the Triple Crown of hitting, leading the league in batting average, home runs and RBI. Cabrera, who turns 34 April 18, is in the second season of an eight-year, $240 million extension.\n\n97. John Smoltz\n\nThe Hall of Fame pitcher has become Fox’s lead analyst alongside play-by-play man Joe Buck – arguably the most high-profile national baseball job –throughout the postseason and World Series. Smoltz’s philanthropic work in the Atlanta area is highly-regarded and his name was floated around in the past as a possible candidate for Congress.\n\n98. Carlos Correa\n\nHouston Astros shortstop. The 2015 AL rookie of the year is at or near the top of a recent wave of standout shortstops in the majors, and the youngest at 22. In 2016 Correa signed a five-year endorsement deal with Adidas for an undisclosed amount estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Widely regarded as one of the emerging faces of the game, Correa won’t be eligible for free agency until after the 2021 season.\n\n99. Dennis Gilbert\n\nGilbert, formerly as powerful an agent as Scott Boras, switched to the ownership side after retiring as an agent now is a special assistant for Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. He founded the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation in 2002 and holds an annual fund-raiser that has raised in excess of $2 million. His insurance firm also is used by many major league clubs to insure multi-year contracts of their highest-paid players.\n\n100. Libby Schaaf\n\nAs Oakland’s mayor, Schaaf stood up to the NFL, refusing to let the Raiders extort the city out of millions of dollars in stadium subsidies a second time. Mindful that the A’s represent 81 home dates compared to the Raiders’ 10 (including exhibitions), Schaaf made sure they stayed in town. The Raiders’ announced departure for Las Vegas will leave the A’s as Oakland’s only major sports franchise, and they may finally get their new ballpark.\n\nCapsules by Ted Berg, Scott Boeck, Steve Gardner, Gabe Lacques, Bob Nightengale, Jorge L.

They're launching entire schools tied to their interests, helping students in their hometowns or marshaling their connections to tie academics to the entertainment industry.\n\nIt started in earnest in 2011, when NBA great LeBron James and his foundation partnered with Akron Public Schools, seeking to lift a generation of kids out of poverty in his Ohio hometown. Now actor George Clooney and music legend Dr. Dre are pledging money and connections to Los Angeles Unified School District, and rapper Pitbull's sports-themed charter school has spread to three states.\n\nCharitable endeavors of the rich and famous can take many forms. Financially speaking, tax implications for the donor are the same whether you give to schools or any other public charity, said Lawrence Zelenak, a law professor at Duke University. But the pop of good publicity might be greater when a donor starts a school, not to mention the feeling of shaping kids' education and the opportunities they'll receive as a result.\n\nIn the latest round of school philanthropy, a group of A-list actors including George Clooney, Don Cheadle and Mindy Kaling are teaming up with Los Angeles Unified to launch a magnet school, the district announced last month. The goal: give underserved students a leg up in the film and television industry.\n\nAlso in June, district officials announced that recording artist Andre Young, known as Dr. Dre., and record executive Jimmy Iovine would partner with the district to start a new high school focused on business and technology.\n\n\"I want to encourage people like us who have been fortunate and had success to come to these neighborhoods and really do something positive,\" Iovine said in a news conference in Los Angeles on June 16.\n\nLos Angeles Superintendent Austin Beutner, a wealthy businessman whose connections helped spur the partnerships, said philanthropic gifts to schools are always welcome, but the latest archetype of giving includes time, human capital, industry connections and relationships. In short: the things money can't buy, which could make or break a student's interest in staying engaged.\n\n\"The common theme between both of these schools is heavily invested people trying to create the education of the future,\" Beutner said.\n\nLA schools to merge Hollywood with academics\n\nBoth new schools in Los Angeles are set to launch in fall 2022. Besides Clooney, the magnet school is set to involve actors/producers Eva Longoria, Grant Heslov, Kerry Washington and Nicole Avant, along with Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, founders of Working Title Films, and Bryan Lourd, co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency.\n\nThe school will be called the Roybal School of Film and Television Production, and the founding members will serve on the school's board to \"build a more inclusive pipeline of career-ready talent for the film and television industry,\" the district said.\n\nThe celebrities, or at least people in their web of influence and expertise, will collaborate with district staff to design curriculum that ties academics to real-world work. That could mean the chemistry of makeup application or the physics of set design and lighting, Beutner said.\n\n\"The idea is we create a curriculum that we can then scale to 22 more schools,\" Beutner said in an interview. \"They can also help kids get access to internships.\"\n\nYoung and Iovine's school, in south Los Angeles, will seek to help students make connections between the creative, finance and marketing side of the music industry.\n\n\"We’re here strictly for the kids and trying to give them a future and something promising that maybe wasn’t available before now,\" Young said at a news conference.\n\nMiami SLAM school started by Pitbull\n\nOther celebrities have launched charter schools, which are public schools managed by private companies, in their hometowns.\n\nPitbull, who calls himself \"Mr. Worldwide\" and \"Mr. 305\" – a nod to the area code of his hometown, Miami – helped launch a growing chain of charter schools with a sports-themed focus. The flagship Sports Leadership Arts and Management Charter School, or SLAM, opened in Miami in 2012. The school focuses on underserved students and connects classes to careers in the sports industry, including sports medicine, broadcasting and marketing. Students even run and produce a Sirius XM channel, SLAM Radio\n\nSLAM was built on the backbone of Academica, an education service provider that runs office operations for more than 200 charter schools, many in Florida.\n\nThe model became so popular that the SLAM Foundation now runs 12 campuses serving more than 5,500 students in Florida, Nevada and Atlanta, according to Milie Sanchez, the organization's chief administrative officer. The foundation plans to open a K-12 school in Mesa, Arizona, in 2022.\n\nArmando Christian Pérez – Pitbull's real name – continues to support the foundation, Sanchez said. Before the pandemic, he visited all the schools at least once a year, often as part of his touring schedule. He also coordinates with other celebrities, local artists and college professors to come to the schools to speak or mentor students.\n\n\"Thanks to Armando, we've had opportunities for our students to benefit from workshops and programs sponsored by partners such as Microsoft, Google and NBC Universal and the Latin Grammy Foundation,\" she said.\n\nCommon and Chance the Rapper invest in Chicago\n\nTwo rappers from Chicago have invested in their hometown's education scene. Rapper and activist Common, who has won an Emmy, a Grammy and an Oscar, helped launch the charter school Art in Motion on the city's south shore in 2019.\n\nArt in Motion is part of a network of charter schools run by Distinctive Schools.\n\n\"The revolution is not only economic and social, it's emotional too, and we're going have all those aspects here at this school for our children to be able to breathe and see and dream,\" Common said in a recorded ceremony for the school's opening.\n\nChance the Rapper, also born and raised in Chicago, took a more direct path to support the traditional public school district: He has contributed more than $2 million to help Chicago Public Schools support arts programming.\n\nFormer NBA player Jalen Rose stays involved at Detroit charter\n\nMore than a decade ago, former NBA player Jalen Rose co-launched the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy, a charter high school, in Detroit, his hometown.\n\nRose, a sports analyst for ESPN, is president of the school's board of directors and remains involved in day-to-day operations by mentoring students and leading fundraising efforts, said his assistant, Michelle Ruscitti-Miller.\n\nLeBron James school in Akron, Ohio, is a community effort\n\nIn summer 2011, more than 300 third grade students identified by the Akron School District for their low reading scores enrolled in the I Promise Program, an effort of the LeBron James Family Foundation that would give them laptops and bikes.\n\nSince then, I Promise has evolved from a bike giveaway to a service-driven program that supports 1,100 Akron students across the district in sixth through 11th grades. The foundation opened an actual district school in 2018, which now enrolls 343 students in third through fifth grades. There's housing for families experiencing homelessness, and partnerships with Kent State University and the University of Akron that offer I Promise students a path to four years of free college tuition.\n\nNational attraction:Educators gather in Akron to learn from success of I Promise School\n\nThe school has drummed up national attention in education and philanthropic circles for its efforts to address students' full needs with services like a full pantry and laundry facilities on-site. James has been involved along the way, bringing children to awards ceremonies and into documentaries.\n\n\"People ask me: 'Why a school?'\" James said at the opening of the I Promise Academy in in 2018. He said he knew exactly what the school's 240 inaugural students were going through, because he had lived it.\n\n\"I know the streets they walk. I know the trials and tribulations that they go through. I know the ups and downs. I know all the things they dream about and the nightmares they have,\" he said. \"They're the reason why this school is here today.\"\n\nContributing: Jennifer Pignolet, Akron Beacon Journal\n\nContact Erin Richards at (414) 207-3145 or erin.richards@usatoday.com.

On Oct. 15, the shooting suspect's mother found an AR-15-style rifle in the family's home and contacted police to have it removed, interim St. Louis police Commissioner Michael Sack said Wednesday. The family worked with police to transfer the gun to a third party known to the family, Sack said. \"... How he acquired it after that, we don’t know.

From what I’ve been told, after his shift, he raced to be with his son & watch our team. Don’t know who this is, but I have tickets for him & his family at Rupp to be treated as VIPs!!,” Calipari tweeted. (The Rupp Arena is the home of the University of Kentucky basketball team.)\n\nMcGuire had not yet been identified at that point, but Kentucky fans quickly found him and connected the coach with the family.\n\nMcGuire told CNN affiliate WKYT that he was at work underground while all this was happening and had no idea any of it was going on.\n\n“When I got out and got service on my way home, it went crazy … I couldn’t believe that it was real,” he told WKYT.\n\nMcGuire told the station that he only had about 45 minutes to get to the game when he got off work on Saturday and he didn’t want to miss his son Easton’s first basketball experience.\n\n“It was either go straight there, or miss half the game to go home and take a shower and everything,” he told the affiliate.\n\nHe said Easton had a great time and they are now looking forward to going to a home game at Rupp Arena in Lexington.\n\n“He had a blast. He was dancing and every time they would slam dunk it, he would go crazy,” McGuire told WKYT.\n\nAnd McGuire, a lifetime Kentucky fan, got to talk with Calipari on Monday night.\n\n“It was awesome, he was really down to earth,” McGuire told WKYT.\n\nCalipari told reporters on Tuesday that he talked to McGuire’s wife, Mollie, first because her husband was still at work.\n\n“And Mollie’s comment to me is, ‘My husband is humble. He’s hard-working. This is hard work, but he makes enough being there that I don’t have to work. And he’s a great father. He’s done this many times,” Calipari said.\n\nThe coach said he hopes McGuire will be a lesson for his players.\n\n“I talked to my guys about it. It’s just a great lesson, and I showed ‘em the picture yesterday of Michael and his son, and I talked about hard, backbreaking work that’s honorable work, but that he makes time for his son, even when he knew he couldn’t shower. It didn’t matter what he looked like, he just wanted to be with his son,” Calipari said.\n\nThe McGuires haven’t decided which game they will go to, but Calipari said that hotels, restaurants and other local businesses are tripping over themselves to do something nice for them when they come to town.\n\n“Isn’t it neat for someone like that, who is a quiet, humble guy to know people appreciate you, and we appreciate what you stand for,” Calipari told reporters. “And I appreciate it because it’s how my family got their start in this country.”\n\nKentucky held the Blue-White Game in Pikeville to raise money for Eastern Kentucky flood relief.", "authors": ["David Williams"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2022/10/25/coal-miner-kentucky-basketball-blue-white-scrimmage/10597650002/", "title": "Calipari posts coal miner photo from UK basketball Blue-White game", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. – All Micheal McGuire knew was he had to drive 30 minutes Saturday evening to get from his job at a coal mine to the annual Kentucky basketball Blue-White scrimmage with his son.\n\nHe and his family didn't expect a photo of the pair to go viral days later.\n\nIt was McGuire's son's first exposure to the Wildcats, but it won't be his last. The photo drew national attention after UK coach John Calipari posted the image on his Twitter and Instagram pages, with a caption offering tickets to the family to be \"treated as VIPs\" on a trip this season to Rupp Arena.\n\n\"My family’s American dream started in a Clarksburg, WV coal mine, so this picture hits home,\" Calipari wrote.\n\nThe game took place in Pikeville, a small city in the Bluegrass State's eastern region near Kentucky's borders with Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nMcGuire's wife Mollie said her husband averages about 50 hours a week on the job with Excel Mining, a preparation plant that operates out of Pike County in eastern Kentucky, including frequent Saturday shifts to go along with his normal Monday-through-Friday schedule.\n\nThe weekend of this year's Blue-White scrimmage, one of UK's biggest fan events ahead of the start of the regular season, happened to land on a work day for McGuire.\n\nBut he was determined to be in the crowd with his family.\n\nMollie wasn't in the photo, which drew thousands of eyes after it was shared by Calipari. But she was cheering the team on from the crowd alongside Micheal and Easton, their 3-year-old son who had his first taste of college basketball that night.\n\n\"When the guys would slam dunk or they would shoot a 3 and the crowd would holler, he would get excited and clap his hands,\" Mollie McGuire said. \"And every time they would have a timeout, I mean, then they turned the music on, he would get down on the floor and dance for everybody. Our entire section had a show every time the music would play.\"\n\nLike many families in the Bluegrass State, the McGuire family – including their kids, Eason and Lynlee – has bonded over basketball. But Mollie said she and her husband hadn't been to a game in at least four years.\n\n‘Effort beats skill.' 'Never give a gun to a duck.' 25 times teachers gave us the best advice.\n\nThe scrimmage over the weekend was a chance to introduce Easton to the team, she said, after he recently started showing an interest in sports. He just finished his first season of tee ball, she said, and will start his first season of basketball next month at the YMCA.\n\nHer husband is originally from Floyd County, Mollie said, which was hit hard by devastating flooding over the summer. The floods in eastern Kentucky that were a result of storms in late July have left at least 43 people dead, and raising money for families affected by the disaster was a goal of the organizers of Saturday's event.\n\nAttending the scrimmage and helping those in need was a \"true honor,\" Mollie said. Their family wasn't personally affected by the flooding, but they know plenty of people in the region who weren't as fortunate.\n\n\"These boys are great,\" she said, referring to the team. \"They're in the right mindset, wanting to help others, and it's just wonderful that they take the time to come here to raise money for such a cause.\"\n\nUNC ranked No. 1 in poll:North Carolina starts at No. 1 in preseason USA TODAY Sports men's college basketball poll\n\nThe Wildcats presented a check for $162,450 to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at halftime on Saturday's game at the Appalachian Wireless Area, money that will go toward the Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund. It was the team's idea to have the scrimmage in Pikeville to benefit flood relief efforts, Calipari noted before tipoff, and Pikeville Fire Department Chief Johnny Cole called the event \"truly an honor\" for local residents.\n\nCalipari wasn't surprised by the turnout. Wherever the Wildcats go, he said, fans follow.\n\nMollie, a former 911 dispatcher who quit to stay at home and support their two young kids, said she hopes the attention will help Micheal feel appreciated. She said she tells her husband all the time how much his job matters to their family.\n\n\"If it wasn't for him being a coal miner and having such a good, reliable job, where it provides health insurance and you know, money to pay our bills and money to live on ... I couldn't stay home,\" she said. \"I couldn't be a stay-at-home mom, raise our kids and do everything that they need. It's a true blessing.\"\n\nThe support, she said, extends beyond his wife and kids.\n\n\"It's not just his immediate family that appreciate him. It's everyone,\" Mollie McGuire said. \"It's all of eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee. Everyone. He is appreciated.

He didn't do nothing to nobody.\"\n\nRiley was among the hundreds who had swarmed the corner of 26th and Broadway Monday where Louisville police and National Guard personnel were breaking up a \"large crowd\" that had gathered in the parking lot outside a Dino's Food Mart, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nWATCH: Louisville police release video they say shows David McAtee shooting at officers\n\nLMPD Chief Steve Conrad said in a statement that someone shot at police and officers and soldiers \"returned fire,\" killing McAtee.\n\nMcAtee's barbecue business is next to the Dino's Food Mart parking lot where the shooting took place around 12:15 a.m. Monday.\n\nHis identity was confirmed to The Courier Journal Monday by his nephew.\n\nMore:LMPD officer in fatal shooting of David McAtee had mocked protester on Facebook\n\nAlso:Viral photo shows line of white people between police, black protesters\n\nWho was David McAtee?\n\nMcAtee, 53, operated a barbecue business at one of the West End's most popular corners, especially on the weekends.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for about 30 years, but I’ve been here for two,\" he told West of Ninth, a photo blog by Walt and Marshae Smith, in a February interview. \"This location is the one of the busiest locations in west Louisville. I always wanted to be in this spot, and when the opportunity came, I took it.\"\n\nMcAtee said he hoped to one day buy the lot at 26th and Broadway, and build a brick-and-mortar restaurant.\n\n\"I gotta start somewhere, and this is where I’m going to start,\" he said in February. \"It might take another year or two to get to where I’m going, but I’m going to get there.\"\n\nThose who spoke with The Courier Journal said they knew the chef as someone who would cook at several community events across the area's nine neighborhoods.\n\n\"Mr. McAtee would help us with Californian Day for at least 15 years, if not longer,\" Greg Cotton, Jr., who lives in Middletown, said in an interview Monday. \"He was one of the ones who would donate all his time and all his food; everybody could just come up and take it and he wouldn't charge because it was for the neighborhood.\"\n\nMcAtee's mother and his nephew told The Courier Journal that he was known to feed police as well. The two said he would give law enforcement officers free meals.\n\n\"He fed them free,\" Riley said. \"He fed the police and didn't charge them nothing.\n\n\"My son was a good son. All he did on that barbecue corner is try to make a dollar for himself and his family,\" she added. \"And they come along and they killed my son.\"\n\nWho was Breonna Taylor? What we know about the Louisville ER tech fatally shot by police\n\nRelated:From tense to touching moments, here's how protests went down Sunday\n\nMetro Council President David James described McAtee as a personal friend who cared about the California neighborhood and all other parts of the West End. He said the local chef was knowledgeable about what was going on in the neighborhood and the city, and always would offer free food to those in need and others.\n\n\"He’s just a good, decent person,\" James said. \"He believes in this neighborhood. He loves his city, loves his neighborhood, loves to cook food, loves to keep people happy with his sense of humor. He’s just a great guy.\"\n\nCouncilwoman Jessica Green said she didn't know McAtee personally but called the chef a \"staple in the community\" who was always friendly to people.\n\n\"And so, to wake up and see that he was now dead, I honestly for the last week and a half, I’ve had a pit in the bottom of my stomach about all of this,\" she said. \"I’m just very distressed and uneasy right now.\"\n\nCotton said the death of a generous working man in the community is going to be another slap as the city is still reeling from the controversial police shooting of Breonna Taylor.\n\n\"Mr. McAtee's legacy is something that cannot be duplicated or replaced,\" he said. \"There are only a handful of people who care about the community the way that he did.\"\n\nRead this:Breonna Taylor's mother asks for Louisville cops to be fired\n\nWhat have his family members said?\n\nMcAtee returned to his native city of Louisville about eight years ago after living briefly in Atlanta.\n\nThe chef said he had \"been shot and robbed since\" moving back because he was \"living a crazy lifestyle, but I had to give it up.\"\n\nRiley said her son was always a good cook growing up. She told reporters Monday that when a mother loses a child, \"a piece of you goes along with that child.\"\n\n\"It's alright to lose a mother or father. You get hurt by that, too. But when a mother loses her child, a piece of you goes along with that child,\" she said.\n\n\"Why? Because you carry that child for nine long months.\"\n\nShe said she buried her \"baby daughter on Jan. 22\" and \"now, my baby son has gotten killed.\"\n\n\"I'm just going through it,\" she said.\n\nMayor Greg Fischer cut through the massive crowd that had gathered at 26th Street and Broadway to speak with McAtee's mother directly. He spoke with the family as some onlookers expressed appreciation for the mayor appearing while others said he was there for a photo op and should instead call for the National Guard to be pulled back.\n\nRiley, McAtee's mother, said Fischer expressed his condolences and said that \"anything that he can do for me, he's there for me and my family.\"\n\n\"He even said a prayer and everything before he left,\" she said. \"Mayor Fischer was really nice, and I told him he was a good person.\"\n\nAlso: After nights of protest, Louisville is hurting.

And if there's one thing the sheriff likes talking about more than anything else, it's himself.\n\nHe appeared on HLN to defend a cop who showed a jar of K-Y Jelly to a defendant in court. That man had shot the cop three times, once in the face.\n\n\"You're going to need a lot of this,\" the Florida cop said, holding up the lube before deputies took the man to jail.\n\nSome perceived this as a threat and called for the cop to be disciplined.\n\nNot the sheriff.\n\nBefore going live, television producers told him he shouldn't say \"punk\" because it could be interpreted as racist.\n\n\"Maybe the guy has dry skin,\" the sheriff said on television a few minutes later.\n\nThen, he used the word \"punk\" to describe the shooter twice in less than 15 seconds.\n\nIf you haven't guessed by now, I'm talking to Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones. And he tells me all of this before even sitting down.\n\nJones - who's now thinking about running for U.S. Senate - has made his name taking controversial stances on immigration, Narcan, national anthem protests and just about anything he is asked about.\n\nIn short, he was Trump before Trump.\n\nIn 2016, Jones led Cincinnati crowds in chants of \"build that wall\" at Trump campaign rallies and has been described in the New York Times as a Wild-West caricature – a \"tall, hulking man with a walrus mustache.\"\n\nTrue to form, Jones' black cowboy hat is impossible to miss as he walks into an interview with me in December.\n\nWe're on the back patio at the Grandstand Bar & Grill. (He picked the location.) Fox News is playing on the television.\n\nI suspect the sheriff agreed to this interview because it gave him an opportunity to do something most politicians would never do – smoke a cigar on camera.\n\nJones has been smoking \"see-gars\", as he calls them, since he was 14. It started as a way around a rule about cigarettes on the football team.\n\nAs a young corrections officer, Jones regularly smoked five cigars a shift.\n\nAs the sheriff in his hometown, the \"giant ass cigars\" he smokes now come wrapped with his name on them.\n\n...\n\nJones knew he wanted to be a policeman in second grade.\n\nThat's when he woke up to go to the bathroom at 3 a.m. and saw his father's Hamilton police cruiser outside. He went to check on him.\n\nHe saw blood dotting his father's face, who put a finger to his mouth and told Jones not to wake his mother.\n\nHis father changed shirts and washed up before bending down to give his son a hug. Then, he went back to work.\n\nJones can still smell his father's Mennen aftershave. He uses it as sheriff today.\n\nGrowing up poor in Hamilton, his dad would take him for a haircut in jail because the inmates only charged a quarter.\n\nBack home, Jones and his four siblings never asked their mother what was for dinner. They knew she didn't have enough money to have options.\n\nIf they wanted syrup, she would have to make it out of sugar and water.\n\nAnd they knew if someone came to the door asking for her, as bill collectors often would, the correct answer was \"she's not home.\"\n\nAs a student at Garfield High School, Jones saved up money collecting pop bottles to buy a plastic leather jacket.\n\nIt was all he could afford.\n\nBut he was proud of it – until someone called him out in front of the school at a basketball game.\n\nHe never wore it again.\n\nWhen his brother was drafted into the military, Jones inherited his jacket. This one was leather, but Jones had 100 pounds on his brother and the jacket barely covered his belly.\n\nHe wore it anyway.\n\n...\n\nNationally, the sheriff is most often compared to President Trump.\n\nAn early supporter, Jones spoke at several Trump rallies in 2016. When he first agreed to do this, Trump's staff asked for written remarks.\n\nThe sheriff refused.\n\n\"It will come to me,\" he assured them before a July event in Sharonville.\n\nSome of his comments that night, such as when he asked the largely white crowd if they would feel safe walking down the streets of Chicago or Baltimore (the response: 'no!'), were mentioned in the Washington Post's coverage of the event.\n\nA news story the next day exploring America's racial divide led with Sheriff Jones.\n\nI was there that night. The sheriff got applause louder than anyone else – Trump included.\n\nBackstage, Jones said Trump's son Eric put his arm around him and asked him policy questions. Other politicians who spoke from prepared statements were nowhere to be seen.\n\nLike Trump, the sheriff thrives on controversy. But Jones has been bullying his way into the national conversation since Trump was nothing but a reality star.\n\nShortly after he was first elected sheriff in 2004, Jones put a large yellow sign in front of the county jail.\n\n\"ILLEGAL ALIENS HERE\" it read, with an arrow pointing to the jail.\n\nHe happily posed for pictures next to it.\n\nIt's this deportation-first stance – and his insistence on referring to people as \"illegals\" – that has earned him a reputation for racial profiling.\n\nHis frequent opponent for sheriff, Dale Richter, told me Jones is a modern-day Hitler in the runup to the 2016 election. Someone who has mastered the art of confusing the public into accepting his racially-tinged bombast.\n\nRichter, a Springboro cop, is not alone.\n\n\"Sheriff Richard Jones’ ramped-up rhetoric is sparking increased fear among Butler County immigrants\" was a headline in April.\n\nJones comes from a family of military and law enforcement. His son is the police chief in Cleves. But even other law enforcement have questioned him.\n\nNeil Ferdelman says Jones' approach has always been to \"kick butt first and ask questions later.\" A former police chief in Hamilton, this approach didn't always jibe with what Ferdelman was trying to do.\n\nWith a booming Hispanic population, the chief created a Hispanic Police Academy and deployed Spanish-speaking officers into certain areas of Hamilton.\n\nFerdelman, who went to high school with Jones, criticized the sheriff for sending deputies into Hamilton without much concern for developing a partnership with the community.\n\nJones called him the \"warm and fuzzy\" police.\n\nAlthough critics say Jones lacks compassion, he opens up the county jail lobby for homeless overnight when temperatures drop below freezing.\n\nHis daughter has adopted two children who came from drug-addicted parents. And one of his brothers died a \"miserable death\", Jones said, after years of drinking and drug use led to Cirrhosis.\n\nYet the sheriff's Twitter timeline is full of people who call him names:\n\nHick. Idiot. Racist.\n\nJones doesn't mind. He retweets the compliments, which are never in short supply.\n\n\"I have skin so thick when I go to the doctor they have to shoot me with a harpoon.\"\n\nThe sheriff pauses after he says this, looks directly into the camera and smiles.\n\nAfter our interview, the restaurant owner practically begs him to let her cook steak sandwiches to take home.\n\nAs he waits at the bar for his food, a Cincinnati firefighter offers him a ride on the back of his truck. Another man asks for a picture.\n\nThis happens almost every day, but Jones never gets tired of it.\n\n\"I'm living a dream,\" he says.\n\nIn 2016, he was elected sheriff for the fourth time. He received a higher percentage of the vote – 72 percent – than any other Republican with an opponent on the ballot.\n\n(Trump received 61 percent.)\n\nThe man at the bar looks down to his phone and smiles at the new photo.\n\n\"This is going to go viral,\" he says.\n\n...\n\nWhen this story didn't run the day I originally told the sheriff it would, Jones' assistant called me and asked about it.\n\nThe sheriff thought he missed it and wanted a link.\n\nNever afraid of bad press, Jones has been known to give reporters names of people he knows will trash him. He says it would hurt the public's perception of him if CityBeat, a liberal-leaning alternative publication in Cincinnati, wrote positive stories about him.\n\nFor all his bluster, Jones is smart. He has a master's degree from Xavier University, but he doesn't tell people that.\n\nIt doesn't fit his persona, which has landed him newspaper features in Australia and France – plus, Jones says, thousands of TV appearances.\n\nThat soundbite personality has also made him a big-time player in statewide politics, where candidates visit his office hoping for an endorsement.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich has called his cell phone more than once, the sheriff brags, even though \"I don't like him at all.\"\n\nIn his lobby is an official document signed by Kasich where \"sheriff\" is misspelled.\n\nJones displays it proudly.\n\n...\n\nIn 2014, the sheriff was asked to appear on \"The Daily Show\" for a segment on illegal immigration. The Comedy Central satire is largely designed to make its guests look bad.\n\nEspecially if that guest is Republican.\n\nUnsure, Jones called his friend Bill Cunningham, an influential conservative talk-show host in Cincinnati. He told him not to do it.\n\nOther friends and media members also advised him against it.\n\nJones thought about it. Then he did what he always does: what he wants.\n\nThe sheriff flew to Texas a few weeks later.\n\nWatch:Sheriff appears on 'The Daily Show'\n\nThe show went how you'd expect. \"Sheriff Jones loses shoot-out on 'The Daily Show'\" was The Enquirer's headline.\n\nBut Jones was happy with it. He got an autographed photo from Jon Stewart.\n\nThat's up on his wall too.\n\n...\n\nSheriff Richard K. Jones\n\nAge: 64.\n\nFavorite Sport: Raquetball.

Think again.\n\nThe Wildcats were more than 500 miles from the Bluegrass State when they knelt during the national anthem Saturday at Florida, but fans and others back home noticed.\n\nA sheriff and jailer burned their UK shirts in protest. One county's leaders passed a resolution calling for taxpayer money to stop flowing to the university. And one of the highest-ranking Kentucky legislators cried on the Senate floor, saying that the players' action was a disrespectful gesture to military members such as his son.\n\n\"People have died for this country,\" said Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. \"They have died to allow young men to go out on the floor and have the opportunity to play sports and speak their mind.\"\n\nKentucky players, who chose to kneel following last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump as well as a summer of protests for racial justice, said they expected a backlash. But did they know the response would be so strong so quickly?\n\n\"With the world we’re living in now, I think everybody knew,\" forward Isaiah Jackson said at a press conference Monday. \"At the end of the day, people are going to say what they’re going to say. People can do what they want. It’s a free country.\"\n\nIt's a controversy that escalated quickly, and it's not as simple as a block or charge call.\n\nSee also:Kentucky Senate president cries during speech over players kneeling\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nUK players decide to kneel before game\n\nUK players decided 90 minutes before Saturday's game that they wanted to kneel during the national anthem, coach John Calipari said. Veteran players approached Calipari before the game about their intentions, he said, and the coach offered to join them.\n\nPlayers and coaches locked arms and knelt during the pregame national anthem, with Calipari placing his hand over his heart. The Wildcats defeated Florida 76-58, marking UK's third win in a row.\n\nWhy did the Wildcats kneel?\n\nCalipari and guard Davion Mintz said after the game the decision to kneel \"speaks for itself,\" while forward Keion Brooks said the action was in response to Wednesday's riot along with \"some other things that we don’t see that go on every day that are unacceptable.\"\n\nCalipari defended his players from criticism immediately after the game.\n\n\"These kids are good kids,\" the coach said. \"They care about this country and all the other stuff. They’re trying to figure out life and making statements they think they have to make. I want to listen to what they’re saying, and then I’ll support them if they want me to be there.\"\n\nAs controversy brewed back in the Bluegrass State, the coach took additional steps to clarify what happened on his Monday night radio show.\n\nSix UK players come from military backgrounds, Calipari said on the program, as does Mitch Barnhart, the university's athletic director. What the Wildcats did Saturday wasn't intended to disrespect the military, Calipari said; it was intended to \"bring people together\" peacefully.\n\nStill, the coach said, the players have made their feelings known at this point. While their statement should not have been taken as a sign of partisanship or disrespect toward the military, Calipari said, he requested that his team's players work toward uniting people.\n\n\"Look, you did your civic duty, you voted. Now, you want to bring people together. Let's figure out how you do that. Some of this might be off away from the media,\" Calipari said he told his players. \"... I don't want these kids to be in anything that separates — including our fans.\"\n\nGerth:Stivers sheds tears of a clown over UK basketball players kneeling\n\nHow did people react?\n\nYou wouldn't be reading this story if everybody had just accepted the team's statement and moved on.\n\nLaurel County Sheriff John Root and Jailer Jamie Mosley made a statement of their own. In a viral video posted on social media, the pair, who were \"kind of disgusted and outraged\" about \"the disrespect that (the Wildcats) showed last night,\" set two old UK shirts on fire. Mosley encouraged fans who felt the same way to come to the Laurel County Jail on Monday to exchange their Kentucky gear for \"Back the Blue\" pro-police shirts.\n\nMembers of the Knox County Fiscal Court, meanwhile, denounced the team in a resolution and called for elected officials in the commonwealth to \"reallocate tax funding from unpatriotic recipients to hardworking Kentucky Taxpayer's (sic) across this commonwealth,\" as the team's pregame gesture \"lacks respect for the veterans that have served our country.\"\n\nThe most emotional response, though, came from Stivers. He delivered an emotional address Monday night on the Senate floor, noting that as a father of an active military member and the nephew of a Korean War veteran, he was \"hurt\" by the team's actions.\n\nTheir pregame statement was legal, he noted, but Stivers — who said he condemns what happened at the Capitol riot — questioned whether Saturday's game was the right time and place to take action.\n\nHe asked people to \"think about the older people like me who have read these letters of their uncles and know that their fathers and their grandfathers served and were willing to serve even to the point they may not come back.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, Barnhart and university President Eli Capilouto stood by the team. In a country built on free speech, they said, it's important for young students to find their voices.\n\n\"We won’t always agree on every issue,\" their statement said. \"However, we hope to agree about the right of self-expression, which is so fundamental to who we are as an institution of higher learning. We live in a polarized and deeply divided country. Our hope — and that of our players and our coaches — is to find ways to bridge divides and unify.”\n\nRelated:After UK team kneels for anthem, Kentucky sheriff and jailer burn shirts\n\nWhat has Calipari previously said?\n\nCalipari has spoken out on social issues and against racism before.\n\nIn 2016 he noted he'd seen employees at stores and airlines offer different treatment to him as opposed to Bruiser Flint, a Black assistant coach at UK.\n\n“I’ve been on an airplane where we’re in first class and they come over to me, ‘Hey sir, would you like something to drink?’\" Calipari told reporters. \"And then they go to Bruiser, and what do they say to him? ‘Can I see your ticket?’ Can you see his ticket? You know me: ‘Why didn't you ask me for my ticket? Why you asking him for his ticket?’”\n\nAnd in 2017, a memo UK gave to players that outlined talking points with media members discouraged athletes from discussing prospects of an undefeated season or jumping to the NBA but had a different message when it came to racial unity.\n\n\"On the current social issues and political landscape, we are NOT going to tell you not to answer these or to express your opinion,\" the memo read. \"Some things are bigger than basketball, and the current landscape is.\"\n\nWhile the memo specifically stated players were welcome to speak out about social issues, it did request that those athletes know the facts and be prepared to deal with people who may disagree.\n\nSee also:What Calipari said after blowback from Kentucky taking a knee\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIn the press conference Monday, forward Olivier Sarr said the team had not yet decided whether to continue to kneel during the national anthem in upcoming games, though the team has not been on the court for the anthem during home games this season at Rupp Arena in Lexington.\n\nCalipari said he still wants his players to express themselves peacefully in a heated political environment. In his eyes, however, the next steps should be about finding ways to unite fans.\n\n\"I said, you can stand up and scream and all the things, but at the end of the day, what are you doing to bring people together?\" he said. \"... (We're) trying to keep these kids on track, trying to focus, trying to keep our fans being positive about these kids. That's why I keep coming back to how they pick people up and what they do. That’s everything we've been trying to do here.”\n\nSarr, who thanked Calipari for joining the Wildcats on one knee, said unity was the point of their statement.\n\n\"I think it sends a big message,\" Sarr said. \"We’re a unit, and that’s what we want this country to be. We are all together in it.\"\n\nReporters Jon Hale, Emma Austin and Billy Kobin contributed.

Yet it wasn’t a joke without basis, as the Hetzels happen to be a duo with serious pedigree for world-record-breaking endurance efforts in niche sports.\n\nLeft to right: Cole Hetzel, Centers, Chris Hetzel, Shea, and Schoettinger. James Weber\n\nIn June 2020, the Hetzel home garden in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, was transformed into a wiffleball field for an 11-player, 30-hour-and-one-minute marathon match of the baseball-like game. The following May, the pair went a minute further in setting a Guinness World Record for the longest marathon playing four square at 30 hours and two minutes.\n\nTo say Chris and Cole had caught the bug was an understatement. When their wiffleball record was pipped by 17 minutes, they reassembled a team and took back the crown in emphatic style, setting an eye-watering new benchmark just shy of 36 and a half hours.\n\nRead more: Meet ‘Snappy Gilmore,’ the viral TikTok sensation reinventing the golf swing\n\n“I think it’s safe to say we have an addiction to these endurance events at this point,” Cole, a cross-country athlete at DePauw University in Indiana, told CNN.\n\n“There’s nothing like doing the same thing for a whole day straight. It’s a fun time.”\n\nCole Hetzel (center) and father Chris have history with record-breaking attempts. James Weber\n\nBig picture\n\nNaturally then, after Cole tracked down the existing record of 1,440 mini-golf holes set in Germany in 2005, it didn’t take long for a joke to turn into a fully-fledged application. The process was no small task given Guinness’ notoriously strict and extensive guidelines, but with the paperwork eventually filed, July 31 was circled as the big day.\n\nAll that was left was to set the stage and complete the team. Putt-Putt’s Shea took the reins on the former, organizing taco, ice cream and cookie trucks, a live DJ and a host of other festivities to draw support and transform the center into Erlanger “neighborhood” for 24 hours.\n\nBeyond personal glory, the event served to encourage donations for Matthew 25: Ministries (M25M), an international humanitarian and disaster relief organization. Based in Ohio, the group worked to provide support during devastating flooding that hit Kentucky in August, as well as during a tornado outbreak in December 2021.\n\nFundraising for the organization proved the “big picture highlight” for Schoettinger, who has previously volunteered with the group. Having raised almost $3,000 directly, Schoettinger added that M25M had informed him of a “tremendous surge” in donations around the time of the event.\n\n“I understand first-hand how tremendous the help is that they give and what a great organization they are,” he said. “What better tie in for a world record attempt than a world-reaching charitable organization?”\n\nSchoettinger in action during the record chase. James Weber\n\nPoetry in motion\n\nThe Hetzels were familiar with Centers and Schoettinger from the weekly tournaments, but their decision to draft them into the team was not sentimental. Centers was a mini-golf sharpshooter with a penchant for hole-in-ones, while Schoettinger, with a background in bicycle racing, would serve as the team’s strategic and emotional anchor.\n\n“The primary skills we were looking for included the ability to consistently knock down aces, stamina, and a positive attitude,” Chris said.\n\n“There were more guys to choose from, but we picked the team that we knew were all fast and could make it through the 24 hours,” Cole added.\n\nRead more: What does it take to win the Open? Meet golf psychologist ‘Dr. Mo’\n\nAfter setting off at 8 a.m., the quartet blitzed towards the existing record. Their ferocious pace was aided by Shea and volunteers, who were on hand to keep score and provide much-needed refreshments as temperatures peaked around 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius).\n\n“It’s important to make sure you’re eating in a 24-hour endurance event,” Schoettinger said. “It’s no different than a bicycle race or running race – it just happens to be a Guinness World Record race in this case.”\n\n“We were like a well-oiled machine, it just looked like poetry in motion,” added Centers, who settled into a remarkable rhythm of his own with a group-best 897 hole-in-ones.\n\nCenters shot the fewest strokes in the group (3,509) as well as carding the lowest round (13-under 23). James Weber\n\nHitting the wall\n\nAt 10:45 p.m., Schoettinger tapped in to clinch the world record, much to the delight of the loyal crowd who had stayed out to support the group. There was time for a quick group hug and a celebratory glass of champagne, but with over nine hours left to extend the record, business was far from over.\n\n“There wasn’t a question about whether we were going to pass the record,” Chris said. “It’s a question of stamina – how much longer can we do it and push ourselves?”\n\nThe group powered through the fatigue of the early morning hours. James Weber\n\nDespite hitting the wall of inevitable fatigue in those early morning hours, Schoettinger rolled home to sink the 3,197th hole-in-one with the 14,664th and final stroke at the ninth hole – twenty seconds shy of 8 a.m., and 24 hours after the first putt.\n\n“I don’t think we could have picked a better team; we just went out there and clicked, had fun and enjoyed seeing everybody that came out and supported us,” Centers said.\n\n“It was a day that we can sit back years down the road, dwell on and be able to tell our stories about a pretty awesome thing.”\n\nRead more: The rise of legendary golf photographer David Cannon\n\nThe Hetzels are already touting pickleball – the new American sensation – as a potential sport for them to target once the sound of wood hitting ball and ball landing in cup has stopped ringing between their ears. According to Chris, such echoes are very real side effects of endurance records, lasting for days at a time.\n\nFor now though, all eyes will now be on the annual Guinness World Record book, set to release in mid-September. Having never before made it in, the duo are hopeful of seeing their latest feat in print among the globe’s myriad of wacky and wonderful accomplishments.\n\n“We’re not in the book yet because we don’t have long fingernails and we’re not tall,” Chris joked. “I think this one’s got a good chance of being in there.”", "authors": ["Jack Bantock Cnn Video Jarrod Williams Amy Li", "Jack Bantock", "Amy Li"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/10/07/indiana-sports-betting-2-years-after-legalization-addicts-born/5609398001/", "title": "Indiana sports betting: 2 years after legalization, 'addicts are born'", "text": "The calls started coming to Chris Gray's work number, her direct office number.\n\nAddicts were bypassing the state's toll-free helpline for problem gambling, desperately trying to find a real person to talk to.\n\nIt was January 2020, nearing the end of the NFL season, and wrapping up the first season Indiana residents could legally bet on professional football — on their couch, with their cell phone, no drive to a casino needed.\n\nMaybe they had just lost hundreds on the 38-20 Jaguars win over the Colts in the final game of the season. Maybe their spouse had noticed the depleted bank account as the Super Bowl approached. Maybe they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage that month.\n\nWhatever the reason, these sports gamblers were low enough they knew they needed help.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\n\"When they call me directly?\" said Gray, executive director of the Indiana Council on Problem Gambling. \"They have really had to look for my number.\"\n\nThe sadness and despair were tough to hear for Gray, but not surprising.\n\nWhen mobile sports betting launched two years ago in Indiana — first with BetRivers and DraftKings going live Oct. 3, 2019, then weeks later by FanDuel, followed by an onslaught of online sportsbooks — Gray knew what was coming.\n\nAn entire new breed of addicts. Younger, less cautious, able to hide their addiction more easily.\n\n\"Because you can do it in the dark, no one watching,\" said Gray. \"One of the signs with a problem gambler is isolation, so it's easier for them to gamble online. Their family and friends may not know. They can do it at work, they can do it at home, they can go to a place and just sit on their phone and gamble. That is a real problem.\n\n\"Addicts are born.\"\n\n'We don't see the harm'\n\nThe impact Indiana's legalized online sports betting has had on Hoosier lives is nearly impossible to quantify, experts say.\n\nThe stigma attached to being a gambling addict can be worse than that of a person addicted to drugs or alcohol, said Gray. Non-addicts see it as a behavioral \"choice\" to bet and not a mental disease, though the American Psychiatric Association classified compulsive gambling as a psychological disorder in 1980.\n\nPeople rarely come forward, said Gray, making statistics on gambling addicts impossible to determine.\n\nResearch varies on the number of Americans with a true gambling addiction, ranging from 1% to 6% of gamblers, depending on the study. But that research also shows the rate of addicts doubles in populations living within 10 miles of a casino or gaming establishment.\n\nWith online sports betting, the need for a physical location vanishes. Everyone has access to betting at their fingertips. Gray is certain there are many more gambling addicts than statistics reveal.\n\nAnd, she said, out of those people who do have an addiction, only 10% will seek treatment.\n\n\"You have a problem right there,\" Gray said, \"people that will even come forward because of the stigma of problem gambling.\"\n\nAnd unlike a person with a substance abuse addiction, family and friends are less likely to have interventions because they are often unaware there is a problem.\n\n\"Because someone is not taking in a substance, no withdrawal, no physical signs, because you can’t see it as clearly, we just chalk it up to, 'Oh this is what the person is,'\" said Trisha Palencer, a licensed clinical social worker and addiction specialist and director of the IU Health West Addiction Treatment Recovery Center. \"We don’t see the harm.\"\n\nPalencer's program opened after online sports gambling became legal in Indiana, so she can make a comparison to gambling addiction before. .\n\nBut, there have been telling signs of the impact of mobile sports betting, including an uptick in calls to the state's toll-free problem gambling helpline. A report for fiscal year 2020 — which runs from July 2019 to June 2020 — shows the number of calls slowly crept up as online sports betting came into play.\n\nIn the first quarter, 529 calls were made to the helpline before online sports betting was legal. In the second quarter, October to December of 2019, 538 calls were made and, by the third quarter, January to March, 582 calls came in.\n\nWhile an increase of 53 callers may seem subtle and not worrisome, that's a 10% rise in people seeking help.\n\nCutting themselves off\n\nThe Indiana Gaming Commission created an Internet Self-Restriction Program on Sept. 1, 2019, which applies only to mobile sports wagering. It allows gamblers to request to be barred from licensed mobile sports wagering in Indiana.\n\nIn the two years since mobile sports betting became legal, 40 people have signed up for the program, according to the Indiana Gaming Commission's fiscal year 2021 report.\n\nIndyStar ran a Twitter poll last month asking responders to describe themselves since online sports betting became legal in Indiana two years ago.\n\nMany of the people who responded (48.8%) said they bet casually, for fun; 40.8% said they don't bet on sports; 6.4% said they bet too much on sports and 4% said they think they might be addicted to sports betting.\n\nThe amount of money coming into the state shows just how popular online sports betting is in Indiana.\n\nStatewide, retail sportsbook handle (the amount wagered in a physical establishment) increased $110.0 million, 38.6%, according to the Indiana Gaming Commission's annual report for fiscal year 2021.\n\nBut online sportsbook handle (the amount of money bet online) increased $1.8 billion, a 272.5% rise.\n\nOverall, online sports wagering skyrocketed to $2.52 billion for fiscal year 2021 and accounted for 86% of all sports wagering handle. The other 14% was spent on retail sports betting and added up to $394.8 million.\n\nBeing impacted by those billions of dollars spent are the people doling out that money. A small percentage may be addicts, but there are many teetering on the edge, said Gray.\n\nShe estimates 4% of Hoosiers placing those bets are feeling the effects in a big way, not addicted, but their betting is affecting many parts of their lives.\n\n\"I call them on the bubble or on the fence,\" she said. \"And those are the people that if something should happen in their lives that affects them in a traumatic way, they can become an addict and they can fall into having a true problem.\"\n\n'I made some rules before I started'\n\nDrew Slentz said he rarely gambled until online sports betting was made legal in Indiana. Still, before he started making bets on games, he approached his wife, Megan Bilbo, to be sure she was OK with it.\n\n\"I told her when I started, 'I'm going to throw 50 bucks in the account,'\" he said. \"'If you ever think it’s a problem, let me know.'\"\n\nSlentz, 37, calls himself a casual, but frequent gambler, often making about five bets a week. His favorite sports to wager on are the big games, NFL, NBA playoffs, MLB playoffs and college basketball.\n\n\"But I made some rules before I started,\" said Slentz, who manages insurance authorizations.\n\nHe has two accounts, one with FanDuel and the other with DraftKings. He put $50 in each. Whenever either account accumulates more than $150, he takes out money to get it back down to $100.\n\nThis assures his bets cannot get outrageous. On Sunday, for example, he placed two bets, one for $5.96 and the other for $25.\n\nHe hit the $25 bet — which required Patrick Mahomes to throw for more than 249 yards; the over to hit on the Chiefs game; and for the Chiefs to win on the money line. Slentz won $75, coming out ahead $50.\n\nIn his group of friends, Slentz said, mobile sports betting is a fun way to connect. The group has a text thread where they screenshot and share their bets. He knows there are plenty of people who get into trouble doing what he does because they take it too far.\n\n\"I think it's good and bad,\" he said. \"It’s more popular so you are going to get more people that have the negative side. At the same time, there is more awareness of the things that can happen.\"\n\nGoing into sports betting, Slentz said he knew the downsides. He has a friend who got into trouble at casinos.\n\n\"I just don’t have this type of personality where I'm going to be in trouble if I do this,\" he said. \"But people do have problems.\"\n\n'Constantly at your fingertips'\n\nGambling addiction is much like any other addiction, typically having the same historic roots as substance abuse — exposure to trauma, said Palencer.\n\nStudies have found that post traumatic stress disorder may be linked to a gambling problem and that people who become addicted are often trying to escape hurt and pain.\n\nArt Schlichter, a former Colts quarterback and, perhaps, the most infamous gambling addict in the sports world, told IndyStar in August 2020 that his problems began with trauma as a child.\n\nOne of his first traumatic memories was his dad taking Schlichter and brother John to the farm. While his dad, Max Schlichter, tended to horses and cattle, the two boys would play.\n\n\"One day I ran into the barn to pet the horses and there he was..one of the hired hands just hanging there in front of my six year old eyes all his life gone from his body,\" Schlichter wrote in his book \"Busted: The Rise & Fall of Art Schlichter.\"\n\nAs an adult, Schlichter wrote, the image of that man hanging still haunts him.\n\nAnother tragedy struck when Schlichter was in eighth grade. He and John were trying to remove roofing tar from a floor at their home using gasoline when a spark from an oil burner caused an explosion.\n\nSchlichter's right side, from thigh to shoulder, was severely burned and the pain was unbearable, he said. And the trauma continued into adulthood, he said.\n\nIn a prison interview with IndyStar in March 2020, Schlichter wrote: \"did you read the book i wrote...11 years ago...it would give you some background on my first 30 years or so...my father committed suicide in 2002...my sister died of a blood clot in 2018...some tragedy in my life for sure.\"\n\nA gambling addict is a person whose betting behavior causes disruptions in any major area of their life, whether it be psychological, physical, social or vocational.\n\nIt also is called pathological gambling and compulsive gambling. The addiction is progressive and characterized by increasing preoccupation with gambling, a need to bet more money more frequently, restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop, “chasing” losses and loss of control, continuing to gamble despite mounting, serious, negative consequences.\n\nThese are people who are unable to fulfill daily responsibilities because of gambling, said Palencer. They may have trouble taking care of family and children, gamble more than they intended, hide their gambling when approached about it, have to borrow money to pay off gambling debt or can't stop no many how many times they try.\n\nResearch has been done, Gray said, that looks at the reaction of the brain while someone is gambling\n\n\"The reaction in the brain of a problem gambler was the same as someone high on drugs,\" she said. \"The same part of the brain is being stimulated and affected.\"\n\nMobile betting opens that door to immediate satisfaction, said Palencer.\n\n\"Online gambling aids in the compulsivity of this,\" she said. \"Accessibility is a huge part of the problem.\n\n\"It's constantly at your fingertips.\"\n\nMoney set aside to help\n\nWhen Indiana legalized casinos in 1993, an Indiana Problem Gamblers' Assistance Fund was set up with a portion of state tax revenue brought in from betting going to the fund to help gambling addicts.\n\nThe state has brought in $33.3 million in tax revenue from sports betting since it was legalized — $4.1 million in 2019, $13.04 million in 2020 and $16.2 million in 2021.\n\nStatute allocates a portion of the money be given to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction and, of that amount, 25% must be used for the treatment and prevention of problem gambling.\n\nIn 2020, that amount was just over $3 million, said Gray, and she doesn't think it's enough.\n\nShe went to the legislature when the state was legalizing sports gambling and fought to get more money allocated to help problem gamblers. Now, she's on another mission — fighting to use the money for more advertising, awareness and education.\n\n\"Because problem gambling is so stigmatized, people need to realize it is a disease and it’s recognized as a disease,\" she said. \"And secondly, there is help out there and there is hope in recovery.\"\n\nSigns of problem gambling\n\nSpends a lot of time gambling: May miss work, school, family obligations or other important events.\n\nHides gambling losses: Frequently talks about wins, but keeps losses and information about family finances to themselves.\n\nGambles to escape: Uses gambling to get away from pressures at home, work or school. Also may gamble out of loneliness or grief.\n\nSuffers severe mood swings: State of mind depends on whether the gambler wins or loses. When not gambling, the person may become anxious or angry.\n\nBets increase in size: Starts waging higher amounts in the hope of breaking even or winning back losses.\n\nTries to stop gambling but can’t: A compulsive gambler may try to stop gambling, but in most cases is unable to quit without help.\n\nGet help for you, a family member or friend\n\nIndiana's toll free number for problem gambling is 1-800-9 WITH IT or 1-800-994-8448 or text INGAMB to 53342 for help.\n\nIndianapolis' free helpline number: 855-2CALLGA (855-222-5542)\n\nGet help and find a local meeting with Gamblers Anonymous:\n\nAnswer 20 questions to see if you are a compulsive gambler\n\nFor friends and family of problem gamblers, find a Gam-Anon meeting\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow.

It was that cold outside.\"\n\nIt was minus 1 that day, with wind chills that made it feel like minus 23. Although Saturday's divisional playoff game between the Packers and San Francisco 49ers isn't expected to be that cold, it's forecast to be around 5 degrees by the end of the game at Lambeau Field, known as \"The Frozen Tundra.\" But the bitter cold \"doesn’t hold Packer fans back,\" Kahlow said with a laugh.\n\nA little wind – wind chills that make it feel like minus 10 – isn't going to put a damper on the cheeseheads' spirits on Saturday. Loyal Green Bay fans embrace the bitter cold. It's a source of pride and their identity, so much so that Kahlow, 61, personifies the freezing temperatures in the stands as \"Frozen Tundra Man.\"\n\n\"The aura of Green Bay and Packer football is the cold weather,\" Kahlow, of Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin, said.

Here's how they prepare:\n\nWear 'many, many layers'\n\nNick Lilja, a 37-year-old meteorologist from De Pere, Wisconsin, goes to \"one or two games a year,\" mainly in the winter months. Because, as he told USA TODAY Sports, \"there’s no other experience like a January football game in Lambeau Field.\"\n\nWith his expertise as a weather forecaster and a Packers fan, Lilja has two key tips to dressing warm at cold games: \"Multiple layers\" and \"hand warmers everywhere.\"\n\n\"I go with three layers for the legs and four layers up top. You want to trap some of that warmer air inside,\" Lilja said, adding that he uses hand warmers \"in each boot, too, on top of my toes\" and \"in (his) pockets to grab a hold of between clapping and yelling.\"\n\nLilja said \"the No. 1 mistake people make is they put on one big jacket and think they are fine. You're not.\"\n\nKaren Waldkirch, a 37-year season ticket holder, agreed.\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nPACKERS: Divisional playoff game at Lambeau Field could be among coldest in NFL history\n\n\"The secret, in our experience, is layers. Many, many layers,\" Waldkirch, a Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, native, told USA TODAY Sports. \"I also wear enormous boots so that I can wear lots of socks and air can circulate around my feet, thereby keeping them warm.\"\n\nShe added: \"Mittens over gloves are a must.\"\n\nWaldkirch, 61, and her husband, Tom, 63, will be one of 81,000 fans packed in Lambeau Field on Saturday, soaking up whatever body heat emits from the electric crowd. But unlike a majority at Lambeau Field, the Waldkirchs will watch from padded seats, as opposed to aluminum bench seating that \"will suck the warm right out of you.\"\n\n\"There's nothing worse,\" Lilja said. \"If you are going to be sitting down on a bleacher when it's zero degrees outside, that bleacher, no matter how long you're sitting there, is still zero degrees.\" Portable seats and blankets are recommended for bench seating.\n\nOr you can choose to stand. \"A lot of people don't sit down,\" Kahlow said. \"You can move around … while you are standing and your adrenaline and blood flow is better.\"\n\nMORE: NFL divisional round picks and Super Bowl 56 predictions\n\nThe Frozen Tundra Man\n\nKahlow's preparation for the game is a little different than most.\n\nWhile others are grabbing for scarves and beanies, the famous Lambeau Field figure known as the \"Frozen Tundra Man\" is reaching for his hot glue gun to assume his role.\n\n\"All the icicles you see is spread from a hot glue gun. I put a pound of hot glue on my face,\" Kahlow said. \"After that gets applied to my face, I put Vaseline onto my skin and pack snow crystals on top of it. It takes an hour to do that to my face.\"\n\nOther than wearing petroleum jelly, which helps insulate the skin in windy conditions, Kahlow said his \"open-face\" outfit leaves his face fully exposed to frigid temperatures.\n\n\"I can't cover up my face with a scarf,\" said Kahlow, who stays up to three hours after games to take fan photos. \"It hits me hard in the face, but it's all worth it … It's the whole history behind the Frozen Tundra. I'm just glad to be a part of the story.\"\n\nAlcohol is 'really bad for you' at cold games\n\nDespite popular opinion, drinking alcohol will not keep you cozy.\n\n\"There is this myth about alcohol and it keeping you warm, but it actually increases your risk for cold injuries,\" Dr. Dennis Cardone, chief of the Division of Primary Care Sports Medicine, NYU Langone told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drinking alcohol is often associated with cases of hypothermia, a dangerous drop in body temperature from prolonged exposure to extreme cold.\n\n\"Everyone says, 'Oh, you got to drink a beer and it helps warm you up.' But it doesn't, it just tricks your body into thinking you're warmer and it's actually making you colder,\" Lilja said, adding that his warm beverage of choice is hot chocolate, \"never alcohol.\"\n\nHe added: \"The crazies that go shirtless … takes a whole other level of booze to get to that point.\"\n\nContributing: Scooby Axson\n\nContact Cydney Henderson at chenderson@usatoday.com.

Bennett decided to write a note and send it to UAB, and he included his dollar allowance to help keep the Blazers on the field. The UAB athletics department sent Bennett a few gifts for his amazing act of kindness.\n\nAlaska: The Palin family brawl\n\nIt was a birthday party gone bad, starring former governor Sarah Palin and her family. According to reports, the clan got into a big fight at a party in Anchorage, and Palin was even said to have screamed, \"Don't you know who I am!?\" In October, Radar Online and Extra unearthed what they say is the police recording from the scene. Listen for yourself. Palin eventually addressed the brawl on Facebook, pointing us to her daughter Bristol's version of what went down. Bristol said someone messed with her little sister.\n\nArizona: Dreamers get to drive\n\nThe courts ruled and on Dec. 22 the Arizona Department of Transportation began accepting driver's license applications from young undocumented immigrants known as \"dreamers\" who qualify under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Gov. Jan Brewer had fought to keep driver's licenses out of the hands of dreamers since August 2012, when she issued an executive order denying licenses to anyone approved for President Obama's program.\n\nMore from Arizona:Veterans health care controversy began with whistle-blower allegations in Phoenix VA hospital\n\nArkansas: Voter ID law struck down\n\nIt was unanimous. The Arkansas Supreme Court in October declared the state's voter-identification law unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Arkansas Public Law Center had filed suit on behalf of four voters who argued that the photo ID requirement would disenfranchise them. The justices ruled that Act 595, which required voters to show government-issued photo identification, \"imposes a requirement that falls outside\" the four qualifications outlined in the state constitution.\n\nCalifornia: Storms put dent in state's drought\n\nNASA has said that about 11 trillion gallons of water is needed to end the historic drought in California. That's about 130,000 Rose Bowls full of water. Storms this December offered some relief, but they weren't nearly enough to end the multiyear drought. After the storms, the percentage of the state in the worst drought category — \"exceptional\" drought — dropped from 55% to 32%. That's the state's lowest percentage in six months.\n\nMore from California:Steve Ballmer buys Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling; 'Six Californias' fails to make California ballot\n\nColorado: Lighting up the new year\n\nJan. 1 brought the first sales of legal recreational marijuana to Colorado and the state hasn't looked back. Three more states have now either begun or approved recreational sales, and tens of millions of dollars in new tax money is flowing into Colorado's coffers. The fast-growing industry in 2014 struggled to manage the vast piles of cash it's been generating, and state regulators clamped down on the popular pot-infused candies and treats known as edibles.\n\nConnecticut: Sandy Hook killer carefully planned attack\n\nIt's been two years since the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., shook the nation to its core. A Connecticut agency investigating the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre issued a report in November that found the killer, Adam Lanza, did not \"snap\" but was obsessed with mass murder and had carefully planned the attack. Lanza, 20, killed his mother at their home on the morning of Dec. 14, then went to the school he had once attended and gunned down 20 children and six staff members before killing himself.\n\nDelaware: Beauty queen dethroned for being too old\n\nHere's your dose of Miss America drama. A new Miss Delaware was crowned in June after the one selected earlier that month got the boot — for being too old. Brittany Lewis, 24, originally the contest's first runner-up as Miss Wilmington, got the sparkly crown lost by Amanda Longacre, who was also 24 when she competed. The Miss America Organization website says contestants must be 17 to 24 years old. Longacre was stripped of her crown because she was turning 25 in October. In July, Longacre sued the state and national scholarship pageant organizations.\n\nFlorida: Jeb Bush may ask you to extend his family's presidential dynasty\n\nThe Republican establishment likely has its first candidate for 2016. Jeb Bush made a surprise announcement this December that he will \"actively explore\" a 2016 presidential bid, giving his strongest signal yet about wanting to follow his father and brother to the White House (see how \"actively explore\" became the new \"conscious uncoupling\"). Bush was Florida's governor from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMore from Florida:Officials propose making 'South Florida' 51st state; Red-light camera abuses exposed\n\nGeorgia: Father indicted for murder in son's hot-car death\n\nImmediately after Georgia dad Justin Harris left his 22-month-old son in a hot car, where he died, people rallied around him. But then evidence started mounting that Harris may have actually left his son in the sealed car on purpose. Police found that Harris, 33, and his wife had researched hot car deaths and had two life insurance policies out on their son. In September, Harris was indicted for murder. His trial is scheduled to begin next month.\n\nHawaii: Lava flow is slow-motion horror story\n\nImagine you're kicking back at home and someone tells you that 2,000-degree Fahrenheit lava is flowing toward your house. That's been Hawaii's reality this year. Molten lava emerged from a vent in the Kilauea volcano in June, and a long stretch of the flow began slowly moving toward the town of Pahoa, in a rural region of the Big Island of Hawaii. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. In late October, the lava crossed a country road at the edge of town, covering a cemetery and claiming a home. Now, the lava is headed for a shopping center.\n\nIdaho: The saga of Bowe Bergdahl\n\nIt was a roller coaster of emotions in Hailey, Idaho. On May 31, the town learned that local boy Bowe Bergdahl, 28, had been released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan after five years. But joy soon turned to shock. Calls and e-mails blasted locals for planning a celebration June 28 for the Army sergeant who may have walked off his post and whose release involved the Obama administration trading five Taliban leaders. Bergdahl has been accused by some members of his former unit of intentionally leaving his post before he was captured by Taliban insurgents in 2009. This December, the Army decided to forward the Bergdahl investigation for possible court-martial. For now Bergdahl remains assigned to a desk job at an Army headquarters unit in San Antonio.\n\nIllinois: Rahm to Hillary: 'Dead broke? Really?'\n\nHillary Clinton took a lot of heat this summer after she said in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001 \"dead broke.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, her old political pal, didn't let the comment slide at an event in Chicago celebrating her memoir, Hard Choices. \"Hillary dead broke?\" Emanuel asked. \"Really?\" Clinton acknowledged to Emanuel that it \"may not have been the most artful way\" of talking about her finances.\n\nIndiana: Colts owner arrested\n\nIt was a tough year for Jim Irsay. The Colts owner was arrested in March for driving under the influence and illegal possession of prescription drugs. Commissioner Roger Goodell disciplined Irsay with a six-game suspension and a $500,000 fine — the maximum allowed under NFL rules. \"I acknowledge the mistake I made last March and stand responsible for the consequences of that mistake, for which I sincerely apologize to our community and to Colts fans everywhere,\" Irsay said in a statement. Irsay, 55, has battled drug addictions and alcoholism for decades.\n\nIowa: Farm families adapt to food-conscious America\n\nThe farm family, with deep community roots and generations living close to the soil, has found itself at the center of profound demographic, technological, economic and environmental change. The Des Moines Registerintroduced readers to four Iowa farm families navigating this changing world. And, in a journalistic first, invited readers to step into the century-old Dammann farm through 360-degree video and virtual reality.\n\nKansas: Sen. Roberts survives close call for GOP\n\nVeteran Republican Sen. Pat Roberts survived a surprisingly strong challenge from independent Greg Orman in November, ensuring that Republicans would continue their 82-year string of U.S. senators from the Sunflower State.

Jay LaPlante and his 14-year-old daughter, Meghan, caught a blue lobster about 10 miles southwest of Portland.

Then, a week later farther up the coast, veteran lobsterman Joe Bates discovered what researchers consider a 1-in-100-million find: a white lobster.\n\nMaryland: Boardwalk pole dancer makes waves in Ocean City\n\nIt was a mixture of outrage and awe on the Boardwalk in Ocean City, Md., this summer. A 27-year-old dancer raised First Amendment issues when she set up her own pole-dancing operation on one of the busiest tourist thoroughfares in America. The resort community's officials didn't like it, but thanks in part to two federal court decisions involving Ocean City, Chelsea Plymale's show is legal. That doesn't mean it hasn't riled people, including a nearby store owner.\n\nMore from Maryland:Ray Rice won his appeal, but it's likely he still lost his NFL career\n\nMassachusetts: Going back in time\n\nA time capsule buried in 1795 by Paul Revere and Samuel Adams was unearthed in Boston at the Massachusetts Statehouse this December, possibly the oldest such U.S. artifact ever uncovered.

Ten years ago, gay marriage was explicitly legal in just one state — Massachusetts. Same-sex couples now can marry in 35 states. But there are many parts of the U.S. where LGBT citizens not only lack the right to marry but also lack other fundamental protections. According to the Human Rights Campaign, Southaven, Miss., is one of just five cities scoring zero on their 2014 Municipal Equality Index. Others are in Texas: Irving, Lubbock, McAllen and Mesquite.\n\nMissouri: Michael Brown sparks conversation on race in America\n\nMichael Brown's death in Ferguson this summer set off protests throughout the nation.

The 19-year-old freshman at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer and given a short time to live, but she has made a tremendous impact both on and off the court this season. She fulfilled her dream to play college basketball, starting a game with the Lions women's basketball team and scoring a basket (or two) in front of a sold-out arena. Most importantly, she began a massive effort to raise funds for cancer research. Hill is now an honorary coach with the Lions and she's not giving up her fight to live — or the fight to raise awareness.\n\nOklahoma: Death row inmates appeal lethal injection ruling\n\n\n\nCapital punishment in America is in a curious state. Manufacturers are cutting off supplies of lethal injection drugs because of opposition to the death penalty, and prison officials are improvising to make up the deficit — sharing drugs, buying them from under-regulated pharmacies or using drug combinations never employed before in putting someone to death. A group of Oklahoma death row inmates scheduled to die early next year filed notice in December that they intend to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Oklahoma City who says the state's new lethal injection protocol is constitutional. The four condemned men who have pending execution dates, beginning with Charles Frederick Warner on Jan. 15, maintain the state's use of the sedative midazolam in a three-drug combination poses a substantial risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering.\n\nOregon: Brittany Maynard leaves a legacy\n\nBrittany Maynard, the 29-year-old face of the controversial right-to-death movement, died in November in Portland. When you're 29 years old, you typically don't think about your legacy. You think about the family you want to start, the house you want to buy, the promotion you want to get, the trip you want to take. You think about turning 30 and the amazing life that stretches before you. Maynard moved from California to Portland so she could have access to Oregon's Death With Dignity Act and die as she had planned – in her bedroom, encircled by family and friends. Oregon became the first state in the U.S. with a death-with-dignity law in 1997. Since then, four other states have followed suit.\n\nPennsylvania: One of FBI's Most Wanted captured\n\nIt was a lengthy manhunt that had Pocono Mountain communities near the search area on edge.

Kennedy stayed at Newport's Hammersmith Farm, home of Jacqueline Kennedy's family, according to the Journal. Obama stayed overnight for a morning speech on the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina: Judge throws out black teen's conviction from 1944\n\nWhen George Stinney Jr., 14, was sent to the electric chair in June 1944, he was the youngest person in the country ever executed. In December, a judge threw out Stinney's conviction for the deaths of two white girls. Stinney was convicted of the grisly murders of Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, in Alcolu, S.C.

Her decision effectively exonerates the teen. Stinney's supporters have said he was forced to confess.\n\nSouth Dakota: Case of missing girls solved after 40 years\n\nFinally, some closure.

Jackley said there was no evidence of foul play. The final results put an end to speculation in the decades-long mystery.\n\nMore from South Dakota:S.D. teen finishes flight around the world\n\nTennessee: Ex-Titans kicker Rob Bironas dies in crash\n\nOn the football field, kicker Rob Bironas became known for his strong leg and his ability to come through in clutch situations.

The news was first reported by TMZ.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to USA TODAY there was a fatal traffic collision in Hollywood, California, around 9:30 a.m. on Cahuenga Boulevard and Romaine Street, but did not identify the individual involved. The incident involved a vehicle versus a wall, LAPD officer Warren Moore said Monday.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nSarah Ardalani, a public information officer for the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office, identified the deceased individual in the crash as Jordan to USA TODAY. He was pronounced dead on the scene, Ardalani said.\n\nThe beloved actor and comedian had a decades-long career on stage and screen, appearing in films including \"The Help,\" \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\" and \"Fear Inc.\" He played Earl \"Brother Boy\" Ingram on stage in \"Sordid Lives\" and later took the role to the big screen.\n\nHis TV roles showed his comedic range and he took scene-stealing parts in \"Reba,\" \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" \"Monk,\" \"George Lopez,\" \"Ugly Betty\" and \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager.\"\n\nThe diminutive Tennessee native, who won an on outstanding guest actor Emmy in 2005 for NBC's \"Will & Grace,\" most recently starred opposite \"Big Bang Theory\" alum and star Mayim Bialik on Fox's \"Call Me Kat\" as the newly single head baker at Kat's diner. The Fox sitcom was renewed for a third season, which premiered in September.\n\nJordan had taped eight of 22 episodes planned this season for \"Kat\" and was working on the ninth at the time of his death.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY Monday, Fox Entertainment remembered Jordan as \"far more than an Emmy Award winning comedic talent with whom we’ve laughed alongside for all these years.\"\n\n\"He was the kindest person you could ever imagine who simply lit up a room and brought pure joy and huge smiles to millions of people around the world,\" the statement continued. \"The truest of Southern Gentlemen, Leslie carried an infectious exuberance, indelible sense of humor and, throughout, gifted us with countless fond memories that will last forever.”\n\nWarner Bros. Television also mourned Jordan in a statement Monday: “Warner Bros. Television is devastated about the tragic and sudden loss of our dear friend Leslie Jordan. Leslie was an extraordinary person and talent. He brought joy to fans across the globe.”\n\nStanding at 4-foot-11, Jordan was known in Hollywood for his larger-than-life personality and unwavering positivity.\n\nSpeaking to USA TODAY at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in April, Jordan showcased his happy-go-lucky attitude: \"When I first got the invite, I thought, 'Oh, why me?' And I talked to friends and they said, 'You know what, Leslie? It's an evening unto itself: There's comedy, there's politicians... you see celebrities.' And I thought, 'Well, why not?' So I'm just here with eyes wide open.\"\n\nThe Southern character actor became a social media sensation in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan documented his time in quarantine and his hilarious and relatable rants on Instagram captured collective hearts around the world. He broke the sameness by posting daily videos of himself on Instagram.\n\nMany of Jordan’s videos included him asking \"How y'all doin?\" and some included stories about Hollywood or his childhood growing up with identical twin sisters and their \"mama,\" as he called her. Other times he did silly bits like complete an indoor obstacle course.\n\nEarlier this month he released a gospel album called \"Company’s Comin'\" featuring Dolly Parton, Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile, Eddie Vedder and Tanya Tucker.\n\nHis 2021 memoir, \"How Y'all Doing?

That will sober you up.”\n\nIn one post, Jordan recalled a guard who took pity on how much Jordan disliked incarceration and informed him that they had Robert Downey Jr. (who decades ago made headlines for a few brushes with the law) in custody and would be releasing Jordan and giving Downey Jr. his bed.\n\n“Pod A, cell 13, top bunk,” Jordan recalled. “I feel responsible for most of Robert Downey Jr.’s success.

Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises.

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock. According to a newspaper account, the \"howls of a burning menagerie ... mingled with shrieks of women and children.\"\n\n30. 1887: Artesian well water becomes available for the first time, establishing Memphis as a city with notably pure drinking water.\n\n31. On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32. A Memphis community designed expressly for black residents, Orange Mound — named for the area's many Osage orange trees — begins to be developed in 1890, on former plantation property. For much of its history, the neighborhood is said to represent the largest concentration of African Americans outside of Harlem.\n\n33. Feb. 23, 1892: \"Tomboy\" Alice Mitchell, 19, uses her father's razor blade to cut the throat of her former Higbee School for Young Ladies classmate, Freda Ward, 17; the sensational murder trial that follows exposes what the one newspaper calls \"the Perverted Affection of One Girl for Another.\" Alice — who apparently had dreamed of dressing as a man and marrying Freda — is sentenced to what was then called the Western State Hospital for the Insane in Bolivar, Tennessee.\n\n34. The city's first public library, the Cossitt Library, opens on April 12, 1893. However, a public campaign for donations is necessary to stock its shelves with books.\n\n35. Memphis' first skyscraper, the 10-story Porter Building at 10 N. Main, is constructed in 1895.\n\n36. A May 1901 reunion of Confederate troops ends with a parade of 15,000 veterans, according to The Commercial Appeal. \"Never before in the history of Memphis were the people so enthused as they were yesterday,\" the newspaper reported, while also praising \"the survivors of the most superb soldiery that ever bore a part in making world's history.\"\n\n37. In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136. July 13, 1980: Memphis experiences what remains its record high temperature: 108 degrees.\n\n137. After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death. It is now the second most-visited home in the U.S., after the White House.\n\n139. Distraught over the death of his 8-year-old son, who had been treated for leukemia at the hospital, a marijuana-smoking and .357 Magnum-wielding French-Canadian, John Claude Goulet, 40, takes a pediatrician, a nurse, a psychiatrist and a psychologist hostage inside an office at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The 34-hour siege ends when police storm the office and kill Goulet on Feb. 5, 1982.\n\n140. St. Agnes student Leslie Marie Gattas, 15, is rescued March 18, 1982, from an attic hideaway at Christ United Methodist Church, where her kidnapper, Ernest Stubblefield, had kept her for 119 days.\n\n141. April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983.

Memphis State University football coach Rex Dockery, 41, and three others — freshman defensive back Charles Greenhill, offensive coordinator Chris Faros and booster Glenn Jones — are killed Dec. 12, 1983, in a small plane crash while en route to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.\n\n145. Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149. Oct. 30, 1983: Founded in 1901, Bellevue Baptist Church votes to leave its longtime Midtown location and relocate to a Cordova campus, where it expands to \"megachurch\" proportions.\n\n150. \"While most of us were stuffing ourselves with turkey,\" The Commercial Appeal reports on Nov. 25, 1983, \"a pair of armed, Halloween-masked gunmen pulled off the largest robbery in Memphis history, stealing an estimated $2 million from the Wells Fargo building on Monroe.\"\n\n151. Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/13/most-dangerous-states-in-america-violent-crime-murder-rate/40968963/", "title": "Crime in the US: All 50 states ranked by murder, violent crime rates", "text": "Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThere were more than 1.2 million incidents of rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder reported in the United States in 2018 – a 3% decline from the previous year. The decrease in violent crime represents the continuation of a long-term trend. The U.S. violent crime rate stands at 381 incidents per 100,000 people, down from a high of 758 per 100,000 in 1991.\n\nCrime is a local phenomenon, however, and in some states, violent crime rates are nearly as high or higher than they were nationwide in the early 1990s. Using data from the FBI’s 2018 Uniform Crime Reporting Program, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed statewide violent crime rates to identify the most dangerous states in America. We ranked all states and listed them from the lowest violent crime rate to the highest.\n\nViolent crime in the United States is most likely to be committed in urban areas. Even in many of the safest states in the country, there are cities with violent crime rates that exceed the national average by a wide margin. Similarly, it is no coincidence that many of the states with the highest rates of violence are also home to some of America’s most dangerous cities. In some cases, a single city can account for over one-quarter of all violent crime in an entire state.\n\nThere's no better time than now:5 ways to get credit-healthy in 2020\n\n'Dry January':Here's what will improve if you stop drinking.\n\nCrime appears to be closely tied to economic conditions. States with limited economic opportunity and a large percentage of residents struggling financially also tend to have higher violent crime rates. Conversely, economic conditions tend to be in states with lower crime. These are America’s richest and poorest states.\n\nTo determine the most dangerous states in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the number of violent crimes reported in 2018 per 100,000 residents for all 50 states with data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Violent crime is a broad designation that is made up of rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\n\n50. Maine\n\n• Violent crime rate: 112.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 24 (7th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 165 adults per 100,000 (2nd lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11.6% (19th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Augusta\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the number of violent crimes – a designation comprised of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder – in Maine fell by 6.8%. There were 112 reported violent crimes in the state in 2018 for every 100,000 people, the least of any state in the country.\n\nMaine's capital, Augusta, had the highest violent crime rate of any city in the state at 323.9 incidents per 100,000 people. But even Maine's most dangerous city had less violence than the U.S. as a whole. There were 380.6 violent crimes for every 100,000 people nationwide in 2018.\n\n49. Vermont\n\n• Violent crime rate: 172 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 10 (the lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 222 adults per 100,000 (4th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11% (16th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Rutland\n\nVermont is one of only three states – all of which are in the New England region – to report fewer than 200 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018. Vermont had the lowest robbery rate in the country in 2018 with 11.2 reported incidents per 100,000 people and the fourth lowest aggravated assault rate of 113.4 incidents per 100,000 – less than half the comparable national rate of 246.8 per 100,000.\n\nLike most states with lower violent crime rates, Vermont has a relatively small population living below the poverty line. Just 11% of state residents live on poverty level income compared to 13.1% nationwide.\n\n48. New Hampshire\n\n• Violent crime rate: 173.2 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 21 (6th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 253 adults per 100,000 (6th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 7.6% (the lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Manchester\n\nAlong with Maine and Vermont, New Hampshire is one of only three states to report fewer than 200 violent crimes in 2018. There were 173.2 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in the state, an 11.1% decline from the previous year, which was nearly the largest improvement of any state.\n\nWhile violent crime is relatively uncommon across New Hampshire as a whole, not all parts of the state are especially safe. For example, in Manchester there were 593.2 violent crimes for every 100,000 people and in Claremont there were 448.6 per 100,00 – each far higher than the 380.6 per 100,000 national average.\n\n47. Virginia\n\n• Violent crime rate: 200 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 391 (17th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 560 adults per 100,000 (16th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.7% (12th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Portsmouth\n\nVirginia is the only state outside of the New England to rank among the five safest in the country. There were 200 violent crimes in Virginia for every 100,000 people in 2018 compared to 380.6 per 100,000 nationwide. As is typically the case, aggravated assault was the most common type of violent crime reported in Virginia in 2018, followed by robbery.\n\nUnlike most other states with relatively low rates of violent crime, Virginia has a relatively large prison population. There are 560 adults for every 100,000 incarcerated in Virginia state and federal prisons, a larger share than in most other states.\n\n46. Connecticut\n\n• Violent crime rate: 207.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 83 (18th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 338 adults per 100,000 (13th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.4% (10th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Hartford\n\nLike several other nearby states in the New England region, Connecticut ranks among the safest places in the country. There were 207.4 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 state residents in 2018, the fifth least among states. As is often the case in areas with low violent crime, other types of crime are also relatively uncommon in Connecticut. There were 1,684 property crimes, such as motor vehicle theft and burglary, in the state for every 100,000 people in 2018 – well below the national rate of 2,199.5 per 100,000.\n\n45. New Jersey\n\n• Violent crime rate: 208.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 286 (20th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 278 adults per 100,000 (7th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 9.5% (5th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Camden\n\nAt 209 per 100,000, the violent crime rate in New Jersey is among the lowest of any state in the country. The state also has the lowest rate of rape in the country, with 16 reported incidents per 100,000 people, a fraction of the national rate of 42.6 per 100,000.\n\nWhile the state as a whole is relatively safe, there are still parts of New Jersey that rank among the most dangerous places in the country. In Camden, for example, there were 1,638 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in 2018, more than four times the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000. Additionally, Trenton has a violent crime rate of 1,161.7 per 100,000 and Asbury Park has a violent crime rate of 1,107.1 per 100,000.\n\n44. Kentucky\n\n• Violent crime rate: 211.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 244 (21st highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 682 adults per 100,000 (8th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 16.9% (6th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Covington\n\nKentucky has the second lowest violent crime rate in the South after Virginia and the seventh lowest violent crime rate among all states. There were 211.9 reported incidents of violent crime in the state for every 100,000 people in 2018 compared to 380.6 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\nCrime is generally higher in poorer areas – but Kentucky is something of an exception. The state's 16.9% poverty rate is sixth highest in the country and well above the 13.1% national rate. Additionally, the state's 4.1% annual unemployment rate is slightly higher than the comparable 3.9% national rate.\n\n43. Wyoming\n\n• Violent crime rate: 212.2 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 13 (3rd lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 560 adults per 100,000 (16th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11.1% (17th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Cheyenne\n\nWyoming has a violent crime rate of 212.2 incidents per 100,000 people, the lowest of any state west of the Mississippi and eighth lowest nationwide. Even in some of the safest states in the country, there can be cities with crime rates many times higher than the U.S. as a whole. But in Wyoming, even the cities are relatively safe.\n\nCheyenne ranks as the most dangerous city in the state but still has a lower concentration of violent crime than the U.S. as a whole, with a violent crime rate of 322.5 incidents per 100,000 compared to 380.6 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\n42. Rhode Island\n\n• Violent crime rate: 219.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 16 (4th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 212 adults per 100,000 (3rd lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.9% (23rd highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Woonsocket\n\nThere were 2,317 violent crimes reported in Rhode Island in 2018, or 219.1 for every 100,000 people. Aggravated assault was the most commonly reported violent crime in the state, accounting for over half of all reported incidents.\n\nCrime in Rhode Island tends to be concentrated in the cities. In Woonsocket, for example, there were 589.8 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, well above the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate. In Providence, the capital and the state's largest city, there were 454.6 violent crimes for every 100,000 people.\n\n41. Minnesota\n\n• Violent crime rate: 220.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 106 (19th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 249 adults per 100,000 (5th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 9.6% (7th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota has the lowest violent crime rate of any state in the Midwest and the 10th lowest violent crime rate among states. There were 12,369 violent crimes reported in the state in 2018, or 220.4 per 100,000 people – well below the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\nAs is the case in most states, Minnesota reported a dip in violent crime in the last year. Between 2017 and 2018, the number of violent crimes in the state fell by 7.3%, more than most states and a stronger improvement than the 3% national decline.\n\n40. Idaho\n\n• Violent crime rate: 227.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 35 (9th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 601 adults per 100,000 (11th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11.8% (20th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Garden City\n\nThere were 227.1 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in Idaho, well below the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000. Idaho's robbery rate of 11.4 incidents per 100,000 people is the second lowest of any state, trailing only Vermont. Idaho's property crime rate of 1,461.4 per 100,000 is also well below the national rate of 2,199.5 per 100,000.\n\nStates with lower rates of crime tend to have smaller prison populations, but Idaho is an exception. There are 601 people age 18 and older incarcerated in Idaho state and federal prisons for every 100,000 adults statewide, the 11th highest imprisonment rate among states.\n\n39. Utah\n\n• Violent crime rate: 233.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 60 (15th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 292 adults per 100,000 (8th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 9% (4th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: South Salt Lake\n\nThere were 7,368 violent crimes reported in Utah in 2018, or 233.1 for every 100,000 people – well below the national average of 380.6 per 100,000 people. The number of murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults committed in the state declined by 2% between 2017 and 2018, even as the total population climbed by 1.9%.\n\nWealthier areas with strong economic conditions tend to have lower crime rates than average – and Utah is no exception. The typical household in the state earns $71,414 a year, nearly $10,000 more than the typical American household. Additionally, the state's 3.1% annual unemployment rate is well below the 3.9% national rate.\n\n38. Mississippi\n\n• Violent crime rate: 234.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 171 (23rd lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 812 adults per 100,000 (3rd highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 19.7% (the highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Brookhaven\n\nMississippi's violent crime rate of 234.4 incidents per 100,000 is lower than most other southern states. Crime tends to be more concentrated in areas that are struggling financially, but Mississippi is an exception. Despite a 19.7% poverty rate, the highest among states, violent crime is less common in Mississippi than in most of the country.\n\nThere are parts of the state, however, that are struggling with high crime rates. In Brookhaven for example, there were 767 violent crimes for every 100,000 people, well above the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate.\n\nA comfortable retirement:In which states will your money will last longest or shortest?\n\n37. Hawaii\n\n• Violent crime rate: 248.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 36 (10th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 305 adults per 100,000 (10th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 8.8% (2nd lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Honolulu\n\nThere were 3,532 total reported murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults in Hawaii in 2018 – or about 248.6 per 100,000. For context, there were 380.6 violent crimes for every 100,000 people nationwide the same year.\n\nCrime tends to be lower in areas with economic opportunity where people are more likely to be financially secure. In Hawaii, just 2.4% of the labor force was unemployed in 2018, the lowest jobless rate of any state. Additionally, Hawaii's 8.8% poverty rate is the second lowest of any state.\n\n36. Iowa\n\n• Violent crime rate: 250.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 54 (14th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 372 adults per 100,000 (16th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11.2% (18th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: N/A\n\nIowa ranks among the safest states in the Midwest and as the 15th safest state nationwide. Iowa's 2018 violent crime rate of 250.1 per 100,000 people is well below the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate. Areas with low rates of violence also tend to have low property crime rates, and Iowa is no exception. There were 1,691.5 property crimes in Iowa for every 100,000 people in 2018, far less than the national rate of 2,199.5 per 100,000.\n\nWith lower crime rates, Iowa also has a smaller prison population. There are just 372 adults incarcerated in Iowa state and federal prisons for every 100,000 state residents 18 and over, a smaller share than in most states.\n\n35. Ohio\n\n• Violent crime rate: 279.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 564 (9th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 567 adults per 100,000 (15th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.9% (16th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Cleveland\n\nThere were 32,723 violent crimes reported in Ohio in 2018, a 5.5% decline from the previous year. The state's violent crime rate of 279.9 per 100,000 people is considerably lower than the 380.6 per 100,000 national violent crime rate.\n\nWhile Ohio as a whole is a relatively safe state, a couple of Ohio cities rank among the most dangerous places in the country. In Cleveland, for example, there were 1,449.6 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, nearly four times higher than the national violent crime rate. In Canton, there were 1,196.8 violent crimes for every 100,000 people, more than triple the national rate.\n\n34. North Dakota\n\n• Violent crime rate: 280.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 18 (5th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 295 adults per 100,000 (9th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.7% (12th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Williston\n\nWhile most states reported a decline in violent crimes from 2017 to 2018, the number of murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults committed in North Dakota remained unchanged from the previous year. Still, North Dakota's violent crime rate of 280.6 incidents per 100,000 people is lower than the comparable rate in most states.\n\nCrime rates tend to be higher in urban areas, and in North Dakota there are a handful of cities with crime rates well above the national rate. In Williston, for example, there were 518.4 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in 2018, well above the national average of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\n33. Nebraska\n\n• Violent crime rate: 284.8 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 44 (11th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 362 adults per 100,000 (15th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11% (16th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Omaha\n\nOverall, violent crime is less common in Nebraska than it is nationwide. There were 284.8 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in the state in 2018, below the 380.6 per 100,000 national violent crime rate. However, rape, one of the four components of the violent crime rate, is more common in Nebraska than it is in much of the rest of the country. There were 63.9 reported incidents of rape for every 100,000 Nebraskans in 2018, the eighth highest rate among states and well aboe the national rate of 42.6 incidents per 100,000 people.\n\n32. Oregon\n\n• Violent crime rate: 285.5 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 82 (17th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 461 adults per 100,000 (25th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.6% (25th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Portland\n\nUnlike most states, Oregon reported an uptick in violent crime over the last year. There were 11,966 incidents of robery, rape, murder, and aggravated assault in the state in 2018, a 2.9% increase from the previous year. Still, Oregon's violent crime rate of 285.5 incidents per 100,000 is below that of most states and well below the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\nMost states with lower than average violent crime rates also have low property crime rates, but Oregon is a notable exception. There were 2,894 property crimes for every 100,000 people in the state in 2018 compared to 2,199.5 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\n31. West Virginia\n\n• Violent crime rate: 289.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 67 (16th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 492 adults per 100,000 (24th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 17.8% (4th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Beckley\n\nWest Virginia reported the largest decrease in violent crime of any state between 2017 and 2018. There were 5,236 violent crimes in the state in 2018, a 20.2% decrease from the previous year. Nationwide, the number of reported violent crimes fell by 3% over the same period. In 2017, there were 361.2 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in West Virginia. In 2018, there were 289.9.\n\nStill, parts of West Virginia are far more dangerous. In Beckley, the most dangerous city in the state, there were 905.5 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, more than double the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\n30. Wisconsin\n\n• Violent crime rate: 295.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 176 (24th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 501 adults per 100,000 (22nd highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 11% (16th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Milwaukee\n\nWisconsin has a violent crime rate of 295.4 incidents for every 100,000 people, lower than in most states and well below the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate. Many of the violent crimes committed in Wisconsin in 2018 were concentrated in Milwaukee, the largest city in the state. Of the 17,176 reported robberies, rapes, murders, and aggravated assaults in Wisconsin in 2018, nearly half were committed in Milwaukee.\n\nMilwaukee ranks among the most dangerous cities in the country. Its violent crime rate of 1,413 incidents per 100,000 people is more than triple the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\n29. Pennsylvania\n\n• Violent crime rate: 306 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 784 (5th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 473 adults per 100,000 (25th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.2% (23rd lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: McKeesport\n\nThere were 39,192 violent crimes committed in Pennsylvania in 2018, or 306 for every 100,000 people. Despite having a lower violent crime rate than most states, Pennsylvania has a relatively high incarceration rate. There are 784 adults in Pennsylvania state and federal prisons for every 100,000 state residents 18 and older, the fifth highest imprisonment rate of any state.\n\nCrime in Pennsylvania is often heavily concentrated in cities. In McKeesport, for example, there were 1,530 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, four times the national rate.\n\n28. Washington\n\n• Violent crime rate: 311.5 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 236 (22nd highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 336 adults per 100,000 (12th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.3% (9th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Tacoma\n\nThere were 23,472 reported cases of rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder in Washington state in 2018 – or 311.5 violent crimes for every 100,000 people. As is typically the case, aggravated assault was the most commonly reported form of violence, accounting for over half of all violent crimes in the state.\n\nWhile the U.S. as a whole reported a 3% decline in violent crime between 2017 and 2018, Washington reported a 4.4% increase. Still, the state's violent crime rate remains well below the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000 people.\n\n27. Georgia\n\n• Violent crime rate: 326.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 642 (6th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 666 adults per 100,000 (9th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 14.3% (12th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: East Point\n\nDespite a 1% population increase between 2017 and 2018, the number of violent crimes committed in Georgia fell by 7.4% over the same period, more than double the 3% national decline. As it stands, Georgia's violent crime rate of 326.6 incidents per 100,000 people is well below the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate. The rate of rape in Georgia, at 25.2 reported incidents per 100,000 people is the fourth lowest of any state.\n\nAs is often the case, crime in Georgia tends to be concentrated in some major cities. In East Point, there were 441 violent crimes in 2018, or 1,242.7 for every 100,000 people.\n\n26. Massachusetts\n\n• Violent crime rate: 338.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 136 (21st lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 150 adults per 100,000 (the lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10% (8th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Fall River\n\nMassachusetts' violent crime rate of 338.1 incidents per 100,000 people is by far the highest of any state in New England. Still, the state is safer than the U.S. as a whole, as there were 380.6 violent crimes per 100,000 people nationwide in 2018.\n\nCrime rates tend to be lower in areas with greater financial security and economic opportunity. In Massachusetts, 10% of the population lives below the poverty line compared to 13.1% of Americans nationwide. Additionally, just 3.3% of the state's labor force was out of work in 2018, well below the 3.9% national unemployment rate.\n\n25. New York\n\n• Violent crime rate: 350.5 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 562 (10th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 314 adults per 100,000 (11th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.6% (17th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Newburgh\n\nThere were 350.5 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in New York state in 2018, less than the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate, but higher than nearly every other state in the Northeast.\n\nThe majority of the 68,495 violent crimes committed in the state were reported in New York City – which is home to about half the state's total population. New York City's violent crime rate of 541 per 100,000 is well above the overall statewide rate, but far from the highest in the state. In Newburgh, a small city north of New York City, there were 1,163.3 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018.\n\nFoam packaging that dissolves in water?:Yes, as Perdue launches online orders\n\n24. Montana\n\n• Violent crime rate: 374.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 34 (8th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 447 adults per 100,000 (22nd lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13% (22nd highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Helena\n\nMontana's violent crime rate of 374.1 incidents per 100,000 people is closely in line with the nationwide rate of 380.6 per 100,000. As is the case nationwide, aggravated assault is by far the most commonly reported violent crime in the state. Robbery, however, is far less common in Montana than it is in most other parts of the country. There were 25.3 reported robberies for every 100,000 people in Montana in 2018, less than one third the national rate of 86.2 per 100,000.\n\n23. North Carolina\n\n• Violent crime rate: 377.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 628 (7th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 439 adults per 100,000 (21st lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 14% (14th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: N/A\n\nNorth Carolina is one of a minority of states to report an increase in violent crime between 2017 and 2018. There were 39,210 reported incidents of rape, robbery, homicide, and aggravated assault in the state in 2018, a 3.1% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of violent crimes reported nationwide fell by 3% over the same period. Still, North Carolina's violent crime rate of 377.6 incidents per 100,000 people is closely in line with the comparable national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\n22. Indiana\n\n• Violent crime rate: 382.3 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 438 (15th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 509 adults per 100,000 (20th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.1% (20th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Indianapolis\n\nThere were 382.3 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in Indiana in 2018, closely in line with the comparable national rate of 380.6 per 100,000. As is often the case, crime in the state tends to be concentrated in cities. Of the 25,581 violent crimes reported across Indiana in 2018, about 44% were committed in Indianapolis, the largest and most dangerous city in the state. Indianapolis's violent crime rate of 1,272.8 incidents per 100,000 people is more than triple the comparable national rate.\n\n21. Florida\n\n• Violent crime rate: 384.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 1,107 (3rd highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 582 adults per 100,000 (14th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.6% (17th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Florida City\n\nFlorida's violent crime rate of 384.9 incidents per 100,000 is almost exactly in line with the corresponding national rate. While the state as a whole is not especially dangerous, parts of it are. In Florida City, for example, the violent crime rate is a staggering 3,052.8 incidents per 100,000 people, eight times the national violent crime rate. Other cities in Florida, like Opa Locka and Lake City, also rank among the most dangerous in the country, with violent crime rates of 2,346.5 and 1,214.9 per 100,000, respectively.\n\n20. Colorado\n\n• Violent crime rate: 397.2 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 210 (24th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 452 adults per 100,000 (24th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 9.6% (7th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Pueblo\n\nThere were 22,624 violent crimes reported in Colorado in 2018, a near nation-leading 8.2% increase from the previous year. Though the number of murders and robberies in the state fell between 2017 and 2018, cases of aggravated assault, the most common type of violent crime, increased by 13.7%, driving the overall uptick. Meanwhile, the number of violent crimes committed nationwide fell by 3% over that period. Still, Colorado's violent crime rate of 397.2 incidents per 100,000 people is only slightly higher than the comparable national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\n19. Illinois\n\n• Violent crime rate: 404.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 884 (4th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 418 adults per 100,000 (18th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.1% (22nd lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Danville\n\nIllinois is one of the 19 states where the violent crime rate exceeds 400 incidents per 100,000 people. As is typically the case, crime in the state is concentrated in urban areas. In Chicago, the most populous city in Illinois, 27,357 violent crimes were committed in 2018, more than half the total number of crimes reported in the state that year.\n\nStill, after adjusting for population Chicago does not rank as the most dangerous city in the state – that distinction goes to Danville. There were 1,791.5 reported incidents of rape, robbery, homicide, and aggravated assault for every 100,000 people in Danville in 2018, well above Chicago's violent crime rate of 1,006.1 per 100,000.\n\n18. South Dakota\n\n• Violent crime rate: 404.7 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 12 (2nd lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 601 adults per 100,000 (11th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.1% (20th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Rapid City\n\nSouth Dakota's violent crime rate of 404.7 incidents per 100,000 people is slightly higher than the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000. While the state has higher than average rates of rape and aggravated assault, it also has the lowest murder rate in the United States. There were just 1.4 homicides committed in South Dakota for every 100,000 people in 2018, a fraction of the national rate of 5 per 100,000 people.\n\nThe state's low murder rate was the product of an unmatched year-over-year decline in reported homicides. There were only 12 murders reported in the entire state in 2018, a 55.6% improvement from the previous year, the largest decline of any state.\n\n17. Texas\n\n• Violent crime rate: 410.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 1,322 (2nd highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 746 adults per 100,000 (5th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 14.9% (11th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Bellmead\n\nAlong with California, Texas is one of only two states in which there were more than 100,000 violent crimes committed in 2018. Adjusted for population, Texas's violent crime rate stands at 410.9 per 100,000 people, slightly higher than the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\nTexas has one of the highest imprisonment rates in the country. There are 746 adults incarcerated in state and federal prisons in Texas for every 100,000 people, more than in all but four other states.\n\nRetirement:3 questions that will shape the quality of life of every retiree\n\n16. Delaware\n\n• Violent crime rate: 423.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 48 (13th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 533 adults per 100,000 (19th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.5% (24th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Wilmington\n\nThere were 4,097 violent crimes in Delaware in 2018, or 423.6 for every 100,000 people, a higher violent crime rate than in most states. Places with high violent crime also often have higher rates of other crimes like burglary or motor vehicle theft. In Delaware, there were 2,324.4 property crimes for every 100,000 people compared to 2,199.5 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\nWilmington is by far the most dangerous city in Delaware, with a violent crime rate of 1,544.5 incidents per 100,000 people, nearly double the rate in Dover, the second most dangerous city in the state.\n\n15. Kansas\n\n• Violent crime rate: 439 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 113 (20th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 439 adults per 100,000 (21st lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12% (21st lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Wichita\n\nThere were 439 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in Kansas in 2018, higher than the 380.6 per 100,000 national violent crime rate. The crime rate in Kansas was driven up largely by a concentration of crimes committed in urban areas. In Wichita, for example, there were 1,179.9 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018.\n\nMost states reported a year-over-year decline in violent crime in 2018. Kansas was an exception. The number of violent offenses committed in the state increased by 9.7% from 2017 to 2018, the second largest increase of any state after only New Mexico. The number of violent crimes committed nationwide fell by 3% over the same period.\n\n14. California\n\n• Violent crime rate: 447.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 1,739 (the highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 424 adults per 100,000 (19th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.8% (25th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Emeryville\n\nThere were 176,982 cases of rape, robbery, murder, and aggrevated assault committed in California in 2018, more violent crimes than in any other state. Of course, California is also the most populous state, but violent crime is still disproportionately high. The state is home to about 12% of the U.S. population but is also the site of about 14% of all violent crimes.\n\nDespite a greater concentration of serious crimes, the state has a lower incarceration rate than most states. There are just 424 adults in California state and federal prisons for every 100,000 state residents 18 and over, below the 568 per 100,000 average across all states.\n\n13. Michigan\n\n• Violent crime rate: 449.4 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 551 (11th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 508 adults per 100,000 (21st highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 14.1% (13th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Muskegon Heights\n\nMichigan has a 2018 violent crime rate of 449.4 incidents for every 100,000 people, effectively unchanged from the previous year. About 30% of the 44,918 violent crimes committed in Michigan in 2018 were in Detroit. With a violent crime rate of 2,007.8 incidents per 100,000 people, Detroit is one of the most dangerous cities in the country. However, it falls short of ranking as the most dangerous city in the state.\n\nIn Muskegon Heights, a small city in western Michigan, there were 2,238.8 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, nearly six times the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000 people.\n\n12. Oklahoma\n\n• Violent crime rate: 466.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 206 (25th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 931 adults per 100,000 (2nd highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 15.6% (8th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Shawnee\n\nThere were 18,380 violent crimes committed in Oklahoma in 2018, a 2.2% increase from the previous year. The state's violent crime rate of 466.1 incidents per 100,000 people make it one of the most dangerous states in the Midwest and the twelfth most dangerous nationwide. Property crimes – a category that includes offenses like motor vehicle theft and burglary – are also relatively common in Oklahoma. There were 2,875 property crimes for every 100,000 people in the state, eighth most among states.\n\nStates with high crime also often have large prison populations. In Oklahoma, there are 931 adults incarcerated for every 100,000 state residents 18 and over, the second highest imprisonment rate among states.\n\n11. Maryland\n\n• Violent crime rate: 468.7 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 490 (14th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 407 adults per 100,000 (17th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 9% (4th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Baltimore\n\nThere were 28,320 violent crimes reported in Maryland in 2018, a 6.6% decline from the previous year – more than double the 3% national decline in violence over the same period. Despite the improvement, Maryland's violent crime rate of 468.7 incidents per 100,000 people is considerably higher than the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate.\n\nIn Maryland, violence tends to be concentrated in urban areas. For example, 39% of all reported violent crimes in the state were committed in Baltimore in 2018. With a violent crime rate of 1,833.4 incidents per 100,000 people, Baltimore is the most dangerous city in the state and one of the most dangerous in the country.\n\n10. Arizona\n\n• Violent crime rate: 474.9 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 369 (19th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 740 adults per 100,000 (6th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 14% (14th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Tucson\n\nThere were 474.9 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in Arizona in 2018 – more than the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate. The state's higher-than-average violent crime rate still represents a marked improvement from 2017, when there were 505.7 incidents per 100,000 people. The state reported a 4.5% reduction in the number of violent crimes committed between 2017 and 2018 – greater than the 3% national improvement.\n\nAs is often the case in states with high crime, Arizona has a relatively large prison population. There are 740 adults incarcerated in state and federal prisons for every 100,000 state residents 18 and over, the sixth highest imprisonment rate among states.\n\n9. South Carolina\n\n• Violent crime rate: 488.3 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 392 (16th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 494 adults per 100,000 (23rd highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 15.3% (9th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Greenwood\n\nSouth Carolina is one of five southern states to rank among the 10 most dangerous states in the country. There were 24,825 violent crimes in the state in 2018, or 488.3 for every 100,000 people. Aggravated assualt and murder are especially concentrated in the state. There were 7.7 homicides and 362.8 aggravated assaults for every 100,000 people in South Carolina in 2018, the sixth and seventh highest rates among states, respectively.\n\n8. Missouri\n\n• Violent crime rate: 502.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 607 (8th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 687 adults per 100,000 (7th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 13.2% (19th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: St. Louis\n\nMissouri is one of only eight states nationwide with a violent crime rate of more than 500 incidents per 100,000. Crime in Missouri is generally concentrated in major cities. In St. Louis, for example, there were 1,800.4 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, nearly five times the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000.\n\nThe murder rate in Missouri is particularly high. There were 607 homicides in the state in 2018, equal to 9.9 for every 100,000 people, the second highest murder rate of any state, after only Lousiana.\n\n7. Alabama\n\n• Violent crime rate: 519.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 383 (18th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 626 adults per 100,000 (10th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 16.8% (7th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Anniston\n\nAlabama's violent crime rate of 519.6 incidents per 100,000 is the seventh highest among states. In the United States, poorer areas tend to have higher crime rates, and Alabama is no exception. The state's poverty rate of 16.8% is also the seventh highest in the country and well above the 13.1% national poverty rate.\n\nAggravated assualt and murder are especially concentrated in the state. There were 7.8 homicides and 387.6 aggravated assaults for every 100,000 people in Alabama in 2018, each the fifth highest rate among states.\n\n6. Louisiana\n\n• Violent crime rate: 537.5 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 530 (12th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 942 adults per 100,000 (the highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 18.6% (3rd highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Opelousas\n\nThere were 25,049 violent crimes committed in Louisiana in 2018, or 537.5 for every 100,000 people – the sixth highest among states. Louisiana also locks up a larger share of its population than any other state. There are 942 adults incarcerated in Louisiana state and federal prisons for every 100,000 residents 18 and older, the highest imprisonment rate of any state.\n\nCrime rates tend to be higher in lower income areas with limited economic opportunity. In Louisiana, 18.6% of the population lives below the poverty line compared to 13.1% of Americans. Additionally, 4.9% of the state's labor force was out of work in 2018, well above the 3.9% national unemployment rate.\n\n5. Nevada\n\n• Violent crime rate: 541.1 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 202 (25th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 584 adults per 100,000 (13th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 12.9% (23rd highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: North Las Vegas\n\nThe number of violent crimes committed in Nevada in 2018 fell by 1.5% from 2017 to 2018. The state also reported near nation-leading declines in murder and robbery, 24.1% and 20.2%, respectively. Still, the state also reported a 22.8% increase in rape over the same period, the second largest increase among states, and its overall violent crime rate of 541.1 per 100,000 people is the fifth highest in the country.\n\nNorth Las Vegas ranks as the most dangerous city in Nevada, with a violent crime rate of 966.1 per 100,000.\n\n4. Arkansas\n\n• Violent crime rate: 543.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 216 (23rd highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 781 adults per 100,000 (4th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 17.2% (5th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: West Memphis\n\nDespite a slightly larger than average 3.6% reduction in violent crime from 2017 to 2018, Arkansas ranks among the five most dangerous states in the country. There were 543.6 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in the state in 2018, far higher than the 380.6 per 100,000 national rate.\n\nArkansas's violent crime rate is due in no small part to the concentration of violence in a handful of cities. For example, in Pine Bluff there were 1,609.2 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018. In West Memphis, the most dangerous city in the state, there were 1,970.2 per 100,000.\n\nGig economy:Could new laws designed to protect gig workers actually hurt them?\n\n3. Tennessee\n\n• Violent crime rate: 623.7 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 498 (13th highest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 553 adults per 100,000 (18th highest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 15.3% (9th highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Memphis\n\nTennessee has the highest violent crime rate of any state in the South and the third highest of any state nationwide. There were 42,226, violent crimes in Tennessee in 2018, more than double the number reported in Virginia, a state home to over 1.5 million more people than Tennessee.\n\nMuch of the violence reported in Tennessee in 2018 was committed in Memphis. The city accounted for roughly 30% of all violent crime in Tennessee and ranks as the most dangerous city in the state with a violent crime rate of 1,943.2 per 100,000.\n\n2. New Mexico\n\n• Violent crime rate: 856.6 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 167 (22nd lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 448 adults per 100,000 (23rd lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 19.5% (2nd highest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Gallup\n\nNew Mexico's violent crime rate of 856.6 incidents per 100,000 people is the highest in the contiguous 48 states and second highest nationwide. There were 17,949 violent crimes reported in New Mexico in 2018, a 10.1% increase from the previous year and the largest increase of any state.\n\nCrime tends to be higher in areas where large shares of the population are struggling. In New Mexico, which is one of only two states with a violent crime rate more than double the national average, 19.5% of the population lives below the poverty line\n\n1. Alaska\n\n• Violent crime rate: 885 per 100,000 people\n\n• Total 2018 murders: 47 (12th lowest)\n\n• Imprisonment rate: 343 adults per 100,000 (14th lowest)\n\n• Poverty rate: 10.9% (13th lowest)\n\n• Most dangerous city: Anchorage\n\nThere were 885 violent crimes in Alaska for every 100,000 people in 2018, the most of any state and well above the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000. As is typically the case, aggravated assault accounts for the vast majority of violence in the state.\n\nRape, too, is especially common in Alaska. There were 161.6 rapes reported for every 100,000 people in Alaska in 2018, by far the highest rape rate of any state. Crime can tend to concentrate in areas that lack economic opportunity. In Alaska, 6.6% of the population was out of a job in 2018, the highest annual unemployment rate among states.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

(“Putin’s price hike,” he has called it.) But Republicans are hammering Democrats for rising inflation, which they argue predates the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats point to the pandemic and stuck supply chains for the current inflation woes, blaming corporations for pocketing profits while Americans pay the price at the pump. The most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents – Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire – have tried to get ahead of the inevitable GOP attacks by introducing legislation that would suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year.\n\nIn a sign they’re trying to distance themselves from the national party, most of them also sided with Republicans on a recent vote to overturn the requirement that passengers wear masks on public transportation. Establishing their own brands in their states, independent of Biden, will be a challenge for Democrats running in November if the President’s approval rating remains in the low 40s. The party in the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm of a new president’s term.\n\nDespite those obstacles, the Senate seat most likely to flip is still a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Pennsylvania has led this list since its incarnation – a testament to it being an open seat in a state Biden carried in 2020. The ranking is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Two seats have traded places on the latest list, however, which underscores the difficult environment for Democrats: New Hampshire slides above North Carolina as more likely to flip.\n\nRepublicans have their own challenges, though, mostly candidate-driven. May primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania are heating up as GOP candidates jockey for former President Donald Trump’s blessing. At the same time, candidates who do have his backing are finding that it doesn’t solve all their problems. (Trump just rescinded his endorsement for the open Senate seat in Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks’ campaign was underwhelming.) He’s backed candidates in two competitive states with May primaries – Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nMuch to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s chagrin, the chair of the GOP committee charged with flipping the Senate recently released an 11-point plan that calls for all Americans to pay income tax. Expect Democrats to tie all Republicans, even those who have disavowed the tax proposal, to Florida Sen. Rick Scott’s plan (released by his campaign, not the National Republican Senatorial Committee). It’s a tactic that House Democrats successfully used against the GOP in 2018, when they tied even Republicans who had voted against repealing Obamacare to that effort, and that Republicans used against Democrats in 2020 in linking the entire party to the “defund the police” movement.\n\nThe paid media (i.e., television advertising) portion of the campaign is just taking off in many of these races, so we’ll see how much that message sticks in the months to come.\n\nHere are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip with less than eight months to go before Election Day:\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nBill O'Leary/Washington Post/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nPennsylvania once again tops the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican candidates and super PACs have spent nearly $40 million in the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey ahead of the May 17 primary, with much of it coming from Mehmet Oz and David McCormick and their allies. Trump has yet to weigh in after his chosen candidate dropped out in November, which is fueling even more spending as Republicans try to prove their loyalty to the former President.\n\nSo what are all the attacks about? Much of the rhetoric is standard GOP primary fare, enlivened with some quirks from the candidates’ biographies. Oz and allies of the former daytime host have attacked McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, as a “Wall Street insider” and said he “invested billions in China,” while casting Oz as an outsider like Trump. (His ads often cut to clips of Oz shaking hands with Trump as he welcomed him on his TV show.) McCormick and his allies have tried to tie Oz to Oprah Winfrey, Hollywood and former first lady Michelle Obama and say he “promoted Obamacare.” (More on that here from CNN’s KFile). McCormick has his own “fight China” message and has argued Oz’s dual citizenship precludes him from putting “America first.” (Oz has since vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected.) McCormick led Oz 24% to 15% in a Fox poll of GOP primary voters conducted in early March. Businessman Jeff Bartos, former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands and political commentator Kathy Barnette all drew single digits. But nearly a third of primary voters were undecided, per the Fox poll.\n\nAs the GOP field has grown, the Democratic one has thinned with Val Arkoosh – a doctor and the only woman in the primary – dropping out in February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and US Rep. Conor Lamb, both from Western Pennsylvania, are on the air, mostly with positive bio spots that give the primary a noticeably different tone than the GOP contest. Fetterman is seen as the current front-runner because of his fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. But Lamb has a record of winning tough House races, with his ads touting that he’s previously beaten “the Trump machine.” Lamb has also picked up the endorsement of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who hails from the vote-rich city, has some significant labor endorsements but is not on TV.\n\nThe bottom line here is that both parties think the other side’s primary will take the eventual nominee too far to the extremes. But, given how much the GOP primary is pushing candidates toward Trump in a state Biden won (and all the millions of dollars putting that message in front of voters), this Democratic pickup opportunity is still the most likely to change party hands.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election runoff last year. He has impressed with strong fundraising and is on the air with positive spots leaning into his background as a pastor and touting the legislation he’s co-sponsored that would temporarily suspend the federal gas tax.\n\nFormer NFL star Herschel Walker is the prohibitive Republican favorite in the May 24 primary, with both McConnell and Trump behind him. But attacks from his primary rivals and recent negative headlines over his business record could preview some of the scrutiny to come in the general election as Democrats gear up to face a first-time candidate whom much of the GOP establishment was bad mouthing this time last year.\n\nBut even with an untested likely opponent and a fundraising prowess that bests longer-serving Democratic incumbents on this list, Warnock is highly vulnerable because of the fundamentals of Georgia. He narrowly overperformed Biden in 2020, but both won by close margins in this purple state. And given Biden’s sagging approval ratings, the senator will need to maintain – and grow – his margins over the President. Turnout will be a crucial question in a midterm year, but in that regard, Democrats are excited that Stacey Abrams’ candidacy for governor may help energize nonwhite voters.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nSamuel Corum/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAs the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson remains the most vulnerable GOP incumbent this year. A Marquette University Law School poll conducted at the end of February found that 45% of registered Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of him with only 33% seeing him favorably.\n\nDemocrats were ecstatic that Johnson decided to break a pledge to serve only two terms, and they see political hay in his penchant for controversial remarks. See, for example, his recent call for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they win control of Congress. That’s a debate Democrats are happy to have after running on defending Obamacare in the 2018 midterms, when the law was much more popular than when Johnson last faced voters, in 2016. (Johnson later issued a clarifying statement, saying he he did not mean to suggest that repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority for his party.)\n\nStill, Republicans note that Johnson has been underestimated before and has come from behind to win. And while Biden narrowly carried the Badger State, his approval rating is at 43% (with 52% disapproving), according to the same Marquette poll.\n\nThe Democratic field remains largely unknown. Even Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, whom the Marquette poll found in the lead among Democratic primary voters with 23%, was unknown to 53% of them. Two of his challengers who have poured their own money into their campaigns – Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski – are on TV, so voters’ familiarity with them could grow ahead of the August primary.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nMandel Ngan/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest news in Arizona over the past month is that GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said (again) that he would not run for Senate, which was a major relief for Democrats as Sen. Mark Kelly runs for a full six-year term in the purple state.\n\nThe crowded field of GOP challengers, all jockeying for a Trump endorsement, is pulling the candidates to the right, potentially complicating the eventual nominee’s ability to make a general election pivot after the August primary. (Former Sen. Martha McSally, whom Kelly defeated in a 2020 special election, struggled with this dynamic in her races for Senate.)\n\nState Attorney General Mark Brnovich is seen as the GOP front-runner, considering he’s already won statewide, but he’s struggled with fundraising. Venture capitalist Blake Masters picked up the backing of the anti-tax Club for Growth and already had the support of a super PAC funded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, his onetime boss, so he’s not suffering for lack of outside assistance. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, who had loaned his campaign $8 million by the end 2021, is up with plenty of ads talking about immigration.\n\nWith the GOP primary still in flux, Kelly’s using his massive fundraising advantage to run positive spots about infrastructure and his work to address supply chain issues, with Democrats also spending on Spanish-language ads. Like Warnock, Kelly overperformed Biden in 2020, but the national environment has gotten worse for Democrats since and they cannot count on presidential-level turnout this year.\n\n5. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nBill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto is running ads featuring hospitality and restaurant workers touting her pandemic recovery efforts – another Democratic incumbent who’s using her campaign coffers to go up with positive spots while she has the airwaves to herself. Her campaign and Democratic outside groups are also running Spanish-language ads – an important early investment in the Silver State.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who has the backing of Trump and McConnell, is expected to win the June Republican primary, but he still faces a well-funded opponent. Laxalt is the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name, but he lost his most recent election, the 2018 governor’s race. Voters may know him more recently for serving as Trump’s state campaign co-chair and echoing his election fraud claims, which Democrats point to in calling Laxalt too extreme for the state.\n\nBut Biden didn’t win Nevada by all that much (about 2 points), and in a challenging national environment – with voters here especially worried about inflation and the economy – Cortez Masto is likely in for a tough race. The former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair hasn’t raised nearly as much money as two of her higher-profile colleagues up for reelection (Warnock and Kelly) and has less recent experience trying to distance herself from the national party when facing voters. She won with about 47% of the vote in 2016, underperforming Hillary Clinton, to become the first Latina elected to the US Senate.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nEvelyn Hockstein/Reuters/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is in for a competitive race, even without a challenge from GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Yes, the Granite State has gone blue in every federal election in the past six years. And yes, by the numbers, it’s the most daunting for Republicans given that Biden carried it by 7 points. But given Biden’s low approval rating and a sour national mood, even a Republican with a much lower profile than Sununu should be able to keep this one close.\n\nFifty-five percent of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden’s job performance while 43% approved, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted in late February. Ratings of his handling of the economy were worse. Those may be difficult numbers for Hassan, a first-term senator, to overcome in an era when Senate races are increasingly nationalized.\n\nJust how competitive November’s race is, however, may depend on what kind of campaigns Republicans Chuck Morse and Kevin Smith put together. There’s still time for these relatively unknown candidates to introduce themselves, but a September primary also doesn’t give them much time to position for the general election.\n\nDemocrats think New Hampshire is one state where the abortion issue may prove to be particularly salient if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, because of the higher concentration of college-educated voters in the Granite State. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire adults in that UNH poll (which was taken before Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court) said they wanted him to pick a justice who would vote to uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTrump took sides in the GOP primary in June, but his chosen candidate, US Rep. Ted Budd, hasn’t cleared the field. “He’s loved by, especially, the conservative wing of the party — highly respected guy,” Trump told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. Budd has had plenty of help on the airwaves from the political arm of the Club for Growth, which has spent millions attacking former Gov. Pat McCrory ahead of the May 17 Republican primary.\n\nThe latest back-and-forth in this race is about Putin. McCrory’s first statewide TV ad accused Budd of being “friendly” toward Russia, selectively splicing comments the congressman has made about the Russian President, including calling him a “very intelligent actor.” The club responded with an ad calling McCrory’s attack a “low-down, dirty hit job” and surfacing footage of Budd calling Putin “evil” and expressing support for Ukraine.\n\nFormer Rep. Mark Walker and combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman are still in the race but even if they peel some votes away from Budd or McCrory, it may not be enough to spoil an outright victory since the threshold needed to avoid a primary runoff is only 30%.\n\nThe Democratic field is essentially set, with Cheri Beasley seeing her most viable opponents drop out. The former state Supreme Court chief justice hasn’t raised as much money as some Democrats in other races. And even though she doesn’t have a voting record, her judicial record could provide fodder for Republicans to try to paint her as soft on crime, similar to the way they’ve gone after Jackson since her Supreme Court nomination. Democrats are hopeful that a Black woman who’s previously been elected statewide will help mitigate the turnout problem they’ve often faced in North Carolina, especially in midterm years, but that may not be enough to overcome any anti-Democratic headwinds in a Trump state.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who’s likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in the fall, starts this race ahead in a state that Trump carried twice. The war in Ukraine has brought plenty of earned media opportunities for the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His campaign has attacked Biden and Democrats for not doing more to increase domestic oil production amid a surge in gas prices.\n\nDemings, who has impressed with her fundraising, has a compelling profile – she’s a former Orlando police chief with firsthand experience fighting crime, a detail that appears prominently in her campaign media. But Republicans are signaling they will continue to tie her to the national party, even on the issue of rising crime rates.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe Buckeye State is playing host to one of the nastiest Republican primaries of the election cycle. But regardless of how badly dinged the eventual nominee emerges from the primary, he or she will start with the advantage for this open seat in an increasingly red state that Trump twice won by 8 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces a primary, too, but he’s largely consolidated party support.\n\nIt’s possible the May 3 primary will be delayed because of uncertainty over state legislative and congressional maps. That would only give Republicans more time for the kinds of attacks that have made this a topsy-turvy race, with poll leads fluctuating depending on who’s on the receiving end of the most televised vitriol.\n\nBusinessman Mike Gibbons and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel led the pack in a Fox poll conducted in early March, with a quarter of GOP primary voters undecided. Things got so heated between them at a recent candidate forum that they had to be physically separated. Gibbons is leaning hard into the outsider businessman persona. “Let’s tell politicians, ‘You’re fired,’” he says in one recent spot. (There are plenty of similar ads – he had loaned his campaign more than $11 million by the end of last year.) As CNN’s Gabby Orr reported, Trump has expressed concern about the general election viability of Mandel and is hung up about critical things “Hillbilly Elegy” author JD Vance has said about him in the past. Others in the race include former state GOP chair Jane Timken and state Sen. Matt Dolan. The Club for Growth’s political arm, which is backing Mandel, has tried tying Timken to Russia, but she has the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, the co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus. (Ohio has a significant Ukrainian American population, although Portman’s is not an endorsement that would go over well with Trump.)\n\nBy far the biggest motif in GOP advertising isn’t Russia, but something a little closer to home, although still some 1,500 miles away from Ohio – the US southern border with Mexico.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nSaul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe prospect of former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the GOP nomination was already causing headaches in a red state that has no other reason to go blue. Those pains got more intense when Greitens’ ex-wife alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed last week. (Greitens has denied this.) His primary opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race, with some members of GOP leadership in Washington, DC, echoing that.\n\nLater in the week, Trump, who had previously left the door open to endorsing Greitens, gave US Rep. Billy Long reason to hope when he issued a positive statement about the former auctioneer. “Have the great people of Missouri been considering the big, loud, and proud personality of Congressman Billy Long for the Senate?” Trump said. “This is not an Endorsement, but I’m just askin’?”\n\nPlenty of other candidates are vying for Trump’s backing too. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt held a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago with Trump earlier this month. Sen. Josh Hawley, who called for Greitens to resign as governor in 2018, has already backed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler. The primary isn’t until August 2, and so far, there’s no sign Greitens is going anywhere. Democrat Lucas Kunce, a Marine veteran, outraised most of the top GOP candidates as of Dec. 31, 2021, but the Democratic nominee would not have an easy path to victory in a state that backed Trump by 15 points in 2020. The worsening headlines for Greitens could cause more Democrats to take another look at the race, but there’s not much time before the candidate filing deadline on March 29.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2014/03/29/indianapolis-baltimore-move-30-year-anniversary-mayflower/7053553/", "title": "Thirty years later, remembering how Colts' move went down", "text": "Phillip B. Wilson\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Looking back three decades, it all happened so fast.\n\nRick Russell was having lunch at the Indianapolis Athletic Club on March 28, 1984, when a phone was brought to his table. It was Johnny B. Smith, Mayflower CEO and chairman. Russell, president of Mayflower's moving operations, had to return to the office immediately.\n\nThe Colts were coming.\n\nFourteen tractor-trailer trucks were dispatched to the Baltimore Colts facility in Owings Mills, Md. Drivers weren't told their destination until the next day: The soon-to-be-famous 600-mile trek to Indianapolis.\n\n\"It's probably the most famous sporting move ever,\" said Russell, 68 and retired in Longboat Key, Fla.\n\nDavid Frick, then Indianapolis Deputy Mayor, waited with Mayor Bill Hudnut for word that the Mayflowers were on the move.\n\n\"It's been a blur,\" said Frick, 69, a semi-retired lawyer for Faegre Baker Daniels. \"It's hard to imagine it was 30 years ago because so many of the events, I can still re-live.\"\n\nHudnut and Smith were next-door neighbors. They waited out much of the move together.\n\n\"You know, Bill, I feel just like Dwight D. Eisenhower on D-Day,\" Smith said to Hudnut according to a 2009 story in The Indianapolis Star. \"I know my troops are out there. I just don't know where they are.\"\n\n\"I was a nervous wreck,\" Frick said.\n\n\"I always say Baltimore lost the Colts,\" Hudnut said in a 2004 interview with The Star. \"We didn't steal them.\"\n\nBefore Rick Hite became Indianapolis Police Chief in 2012, he was a Baltimore cop for 31½years, 12½of those on protection detail for Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer, who later became Maryland governor. It was Hite who phoned Schaefer in the wee hours of March 29 to deliver the bad news.\n\n\"I felt like I was the Grim Reaper on this one,\" Hite said Thursday.\n\nNot all the men involved or affected by Indianapolis landing an NFL team can share their thoughts on the 30-year anniversary of the Mayflower move. Colts owner Bob Irsay, Smith and Schaefer have died. Current Colts owner Jim Irsay was unavailable after checking into an out-of-state health care facility for treatment following his arrest on preliminary charges of driving while impaired and four counts of possession of a controlled substance.\n\nBut there are enough people who experienced what happened — from the months leading up to the Mayflower trucks' arrival at the Baltimore Colts complex on March 28, 1984 to when they were unloaded at Fall Creek Elementary School on the 4900 block of Kessler Boulevard East Drive two days later — to provide a detailed account.\n\nNot much notice\n\nIn the fall of 1983, Russell remembered Smith first broaching the subject of Indianapolis possibly landing the Colts.\n\nRussell: Johnny B. told me he had gotten together with the guys that were putting together an offer for the Colts; Mayor Bill Hudnut, the Capital Improvement Board and all the leaders in town. They were going to offer all these things to the Colts in order to get them to move to Indy.\n\nHe said, \"I just thought you ought to know, I threw in a free move of all their equipment, training center and offices and all.\" At that time, the Colts were negotiating with other cities, including Phoenix. I asked, \"Can you give me a contact so I can start to learn something about what needs to be done if we do get the team?\" He gave me (Bob Irsay attorney Michael) Chernoff's name. Chernoff said, \"Oh, no, no, no. We can't have any moving companies there.\" I said, \"Well, give me as much notice as you can if it's going to happen. It's a big move.\" I talked a little to him about what would need to be done, so I had some expectation. Then I kind of forgot about it.\"\n\nFrick handled the city's negotiations with Chernoff on finalizing the deal. But the lawyer recalls another date of importance, Feb. 23, 1984, when he brought Bob Irsay to the Hoosier Dome for the first time.\n\nFrick: He wanted to see the stadium and obviously we wanted to show him the stadium, that we were pretty serious. I took him over to the Hoosier Dome. We were about three or four months from having the project completed. It was sufficient that he could see the place he was going to play.\n\nWe walked through the vomitory out on the field and he was silent. It struck me as a little bit of an odd situation because he was so talkative most of the time. I asked him, \"Mr. Irsay, are you OK?\" There was a long pause. He said, \"You know, these are the Colts colors.\" The silver in the seats, the white roof and the dark blue seats were all Colts colors. He said, \"You know, this just might be meant to be.\" It struck me. I then realized we had moved up in his thinking from just being a bargaining chip in his dealings with Baltimore to a true, viable alternative to locate his franchise.\n\nMark Herrmann (former Purdue quarterback who joined the Colts in 1983): That whole season, we had heard rumblings something was going to happen. Mr. Irsay was not happy. There was not a smooth relationship between he and the city of Baltimore. The fan support was not great by any means. It was not a fun season. I had just come from Denver, where everybody was just so rabid about the Broncos. It was such a shock to me to have to go into a half-empty stadium and not have that support from a tremendously traditional franchise that had been behind that team forever.As players, we put those distractions on the back burner, but it was always being brought up and talked about.\n\nI think a lot of those fans were living back in those Johnny Unitas days, Artie Donovan, Tom Matte, the late-'50s and early-'60s. We were kind of underachievers and those guys still lived there, so it was always there, and there was always that comparison. That gave you an empty feeling. This is our team, but we're not there to support you really. We're kind of living in the past and you guys aren't living up to our view of what the Colts are in our minds.\"\n\nHite, who grew up in Baltimore: My first football was a Colts football. You have to remember, back in those days, this was before the multi-million dollar contract. It was not unheard of that the Colts players lived in the community where they played. They worked part-time in the off-season. They sold cars, some owned car dealerships. Some worked in the liquor business, they owned bars and restaurants. … People knew who these guys were.\n\nSpeculation was rampant about what Bob Irsay might do next. The owner was dissatisfied with outdated Memorial Stadium, where attendance had steadily declined. The Colts averaged 38,336 fans in the 52,860-seat venue. The last game drew 20,418.\n\nPete Ward (now the Colts chief operating officer, an administrative assistant in 1984): Bob Irsay had discussions with the governor of Arizona. We came really this close (holds fingers close together) to moving to Phoenix in late January of '84. That fell through. There was talk about Memphis, and that kind of dissipated. In March, the talk turned toward Indianapolis. We had to plan for minicamps, the draft, certainly training camp ... the schedule is about to come out. By late March, we never expected that we would actually move. We kind of thought it was a negotiating ploy to get a better deal with the city of Baltimore.\n\nIrsay's much-publicized visits to other cities to gauge interest in the franchise upset Baltimore city officials and fans. On March 27, Maryland's State Legislature started the process to seize the Colts through eminent domain, a law that allows government to claim private property for public use. Hello, Indianapolis.\n\nFrick: The Colts left Baltimore because they had a terrible stadium, they weren't drawing crowds and, most importantly, the city of Baltimore and Maryland Legislature sought to take the Colts away from Bob Irsay by using eminent domain. That really called the question for Mr. Irsay. He had to get out of Maryland or they were going to take the franchise away from him.\n\nThe city of Baltimore had promised not to use eminent domain, then they broke that promise by trying to get a bill through the legislature in expedited form in a timetable so they could take it away from him.\n\nChernoff said to The Star in 2004: They had put a gun to our head and cocked it. We couldn't wait to find out if it was loaded.\n\nChernoff, 78 and living in Glencoe, Ill., was asked about his memorable comment last year: That was absolutely accurate. I said it, and I meant it. We just didn't give the mayor (Schaefer) a chance to pull the trigger.Schaefer, however, insisted in a 2004 interview with The Star that he wouldn't have resorted to using eminent domain to keep the Colts in Baltimore.\n\nSchaefer (in 2004): That's a bunch of bull. There was some talk of that, but I never would have allowed it. That was never in the picture because I trusted (Irsay). Irsay just downright fooled me. He kept telling me he wasn't leaving. He kept negotiating with us, and all the time he had already made the deal with Indianapolis.\n\nMoving out\n\nEquipment manager Jon Scott, who is still with the Colts, received a call from general manager Jim Irsay in the early morning of March 28.\n\n\"Hey, I've just talked to my dad,\" Scott recalled Jim saying. \"We're mo-o-o-ving.\"\n\n\"Phoenix?\" Scott asked.\n\nAfter a long pause, Jim Irsay said, \"No-o-o. Indy-y-y.\"\n\nScott: I thought, \"Oh my God. I'm going to a city that I've never been to before. It's about to be our longest road trip ever.\" It woke me up, for sure. Instructions were to get as many boxes as I could. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone in the building. Don't tell your parents. Don't tell your friends. You had to be very secretive. Sure enough, I was able to get a whole bunch of boxes, as many as I could put in my van. We closed the doors (at the complex) early that morning and I started packing football equipment all day and all night.\n\nRussell: I was having lunch at the Athletic Club and the maître d' brought the telephone to my table. In those days, we didn't have cell phones. It was Johnny B.\n\n\"Rick, you better get back to the office quick,\" Russell recalled Smith saying.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Russell asked.\n\n\"We've got to move the Colts,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Good, good, that means we're going to get 'em,\" Russell said.\n\n\"I think so, but we've got to move 'em,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Well, I've got time to work on that, don't I?\" Russell said.\n\n\"No, we've got to move them tonight,\" Smith said.\n\nSo I jumped in the car and headed back to the office and spent a little bit of time with Johnny and then went to work pulling together all the people and the resources that we were going to need to get it done that night. It was some quick planning.\n\nChernoff used the Irsay jet to stop by Indianapolis and pick up a Mayflower contact to oversee the move in Baltimore. They flew to Washington, D.C.\n\nRussell: They landed in Washington rather than Baltimore, thinking they didn't want to be seen by the media when they landed. Everybody was on point on this thing, looking for the jet. The word got out that they had landed in Washington. Media guys were following them downtown from Dulles. They were going to cut through the city, but they couldn't lose these media people. They pulled into the front lobby of the hotel, and the two people jumped out and went in like they were going to check in, then went out the back door and caught a cab and took that to Alexandria, Va., where our Washington office was located.\n\nWe had already talked to Washington and they were busy putting together a crew. I think they got 30-some men to help load and pack everything. We had a bus to run them out to the training center.\n\nWard: Jim called me down to his office (later that afternoon). He said, \"Ten o'clock tonight, you need to be here. My dad says we're moving to Indianapolis. There's going to be a lot of Mayflower vans moving in. You need to be here to maintain some semblance of order.\"\n\nColts assistant cinematographer Marty Heckscher: It was kind of a queasy feeling. It was kind of open-ended. I was a young man, my wife and I had a baby on Feb. 13th. There were a lot of changes going on in my life then and now the Colts are moving to Indianapolis? What's Indianapolis? What am I getting myself into? Then you get yourself busy and you don't think about it. You're focused on moving everything. You're a professional. The emotion, you set aside.\n\nRussell: We had guys in our traffic department in Indianapolis searching for empty tractor-trailer units starting out within 100 miles of the Baltimore training facility. We probably had 3,000 trucks then (but) they had to get there quickly. We widened the circle to 200, 300 miles before we came up with 14 empty ones that were available to handle the job.\n\nWe didn't tell the drivers what they were going to be doing. We just gave them a location to head towards. They went to our Alexandria office and then gradually were sent out one at a time to the Baltimore facility in Owings Mills. I think the first tractor trailer was there in the 7 p.m. range, not long after dark. Then we just kind of sent them in one at a time. There wasn't room to have all 14 there. The media was onto it by 8 or 9 p.m. They started showing up, knew we were there and what we were doing. We had enough people on the scene to do the job fairly quickly.\n\nHeckscher: The first thing they loaded when the trucks got to the complex were the business records. That first truck went north, the shortest distance to the state line. They wanted to get the records out of state as soon as possible. They took the long way to Indianapolis.\n\nA bus also arrived at the complex.\n\nWard: I couldn't figure out what the bus was for. So I went up and got the door open and I went into the bus and there were about 40 Hell's Angels staring me in the face. They said, \"Is this an embassy, man?\" They thought it was an embassy moving, which happens in the middle of the night. They didn't know where they were, which was part of the plan really. They were the packers.\n\nScott: I had heard a rumor that these guys came from Washington, D.C. I'm in the other room, then I come back in and I'm noticing a lot of these workers have underneath their jackets Baltimore Colts T-shirts on. I'm thinking, \"Wait a minute. They're from D.C. Aren't they Redskins fans? We might be getting ripped off here a little bit.\"\n\nThe packers were given 10 minutes to return anything taken while Scott and others left the room.\n\nScott: We went back in there and there was a pile of stuff. Hats. T-shirts. Sweatshirts.\n\nHeckscher: The trucks were leaving as they were loaded. It was a snowy night. It was kind of yucky. It was kind of like seeing a UFO. Is this really happening? Am I dreaming?\n\nHeckscher, 58, retired in St. Augustine, Fla., with his wife Stephanie, says many Colts employees lived in the adjacent Morningside Heights apartments.\n\nHeckscher: We were all young and mobile. In that kind of realm, it made the nucleus of this organization very tight. We did a lot together. That made the move easier, to be with people you're comfortable with. They're like family.\n\nWard: I was young and I was single. I thought, \"OK, I can't believe it, but here we go.\" There was a lot going through your head at the time. We're uprooting on a very, very, very, very short notice. You're moving and you don't know what the situation is going to be like in Indy; where the offices are going to be, where your life is headed, but I went along with it and the rest is history.\n\nScott: I worked all night until about 4 a.m., went back to my apartment, which was fortunately right next to the complex. Got about an hour's sleep. Then back to work the next day.\n\nRussell: The last truck left at about 4 a.m. on March 29th. The drivers were instructed to scatter. We didn't want them to be in a caravan. We didn't want them hanging out together so as to draw attention to them. We told them to drive 100 miles or so and find a place to get some sleep, then call in the next morning and we would give them their next instructions.\n\nHite, who got the news of the move about the time the last truck departed and woke up Schaefer with a phone call: I remember it was a cold, blustery day, a little snow. There was some activity at the Colts complex. We had off-duty police working there at the time. … I've had to call the mayor on other occasions. We had the sinking of the clipper ship, Pride I (in 1986). I had to wake him to tell him the ship had sunk in the Caribbean.\n\nHite was amused when told how officials were wary of the trucks being stopped before they could leave the state, hence the secretive instructions.\n\nHite: The fear of the owner and the mayor of Indianapolis (was) that State Police may stop the vehicles and seize the Colts memorabilia. That was part of the discussion (afterward), the folklore.\n\nHerrmann: I was actually back in Denver. It wasn't a good season. Just like the rest of the country, we saw the trucks moving along (on TV) and headed for Indianapolis. Needless to say, we were thrilled; a chance to come back home where I grew up (in Carmel) and we left the city of Baltimore, where really I didn't have any relationship or feeling for the city. I had played some, was hurt some. It was just a tough, tough year. Nothing against the city, it just didn't feel right. The whole season was not what I expected.\n\nThis (move) is good. This is really good. You've got a willing city, an excited city. Granted, it was kind a novel approach and novel thing for this city to get pro football, but still, there was an excitement. We want you. We're excited to have you. It was the total opposite of what we had just come from in Baltimore.\n\nAdjusting on the fly\n\nWard, who stayed at the complex after the final Mayflower left: I fell asleep on the floor in my empty office. When I woke up, there were employees arriving for work. They didn't know what else to do, so they came in. It was 8:30 in the morning. I lifted my head off of the floor and here were my fellow employees staring at me. That was an emotional moment. They were all pretty broken up about it. They had no idea what was going on, what the future held for them. We had a company meeting and basically said who was going and who was not. I wasn't in charge of that, but that's how it went down.\n\nScott: As soon as we landed in Indianapolis, we got out of the Irsay jet and I couldn't believe all the photographers and all of the cameras. And they followed us all day long. We went to the Hoosier Dome. We went to Fall Creek Elementary School; we were supposed to set up camp (there) and make it an NFL complex. They followed us right over to where we stayed that night. They followed us into the hotel lobby, all the cameras, always on us, right into the elevator. I thought the guys were actually going to get into the elevator with us, but they didn't. Cameras on us. The doors shut. I had to look over at Jim and say, \"I wonder if this is how The Beatles felt back in 1964, coming over from Liverpool (England).\"\n\nRussell: At about 11 p.m. (on March 28), I went home to get some sleep and then came back to the office at 8 the next morning. I came up the side door to my office on the second floor and my secretary met me at my door and said, \"Have you been down to the lobby? There are two television crews from Baltimore down there who want to talk to you.\" I said, \"Oh, great. I can't tell them anything, but I'll be glad to go down and meet with them.\" I went down and explained to them that we were just instructed to load everything up and they would let us know where it's going. They didn't like that answer, but they accepted it.\n\nLater that day, the announcement was made (by Hudnut) that they were coming to Indianapolis. We had already told the drivers of the trucks to begin to head toward Indianapolis. We started giving that order to the drivers at about 9 in the morning. Most of them arrived later that day or that night. They were all there within 24 hours after we gave them that instruction. They parked out back at our Mayflower office on Michigan Avenue.\n\nIt was Friday when we moved them out to their temporary training center (at Fall Creek Elementary). The helicopters were flying over. We didn't tell anybody where they were going until the day we delivered at the temporary training center. We had them all come to our facility first and park back near the garage. They went by caravan to their place. That's when Hudnut was out there waving the trucks on, from in front of our facility, when they made the turn to go South on Michigan Avenue. All of our employees were out in front cheering on the drivers as they pulled out to take everything down to the training center.\n\nWard: When we got here, it was even more exhausting. It was like starting a franchise, really, from scratch, except that you already had your players and your coaches. We didn't have a telephone. We didn't know what our address was. We didn't have stationery. We didn't have a copier. We didn't have anybody to answer telephones. Worst of all, we had a hundred boxes piled up on the floor with no labels on them. So before we could ever start to work on planning for the upcoming season, we had to unload boxes and figure out where everything went. That was a real nightmare. There was not enough time in each day for months. You could have worked 24 hours a day for five months straight and still not get everything done.\n\nScott: As the first trucks pulled up, we would actually take all the boxes and put them in the gymnasium in a large pile, eight boxes high, and literally open each box, try to figure out what it was and then whose department it belonged to and then put it in the corner of the gymnasium. That took us many, many days.\n\nWard: My first meal in Indianapolis, Jim called me and he actually had one of the first cell phones, he was going through a Burger King or McDonald's (drivethru) and he called me and asked if I wanted something.\n\nHistoric legacy\n\nFrick and Chernoff struck a 20-year deal with two five-year options. The city guaranteed the Colts $7 million in annual revenue. Annual rent was $250,000. The Colts and city shared suite license revenue, the team receiving the initial $500,000 and the city getting the rest. Concessions as well as videoboard and signage revenue were shared. The city kept parking proceeds. Game-day operating expenses were the city's responsibility. Chicago's Merchant Bank loaned Bob Irsay $15 million to pay off a debt to a Baltimore bank. The city would help subsidize the interest payments. Frick estimates Indianapolis profited at least $2 million per year initially from the Colts coming to town.\n\nBaltimore tried unsuccessfully to sue Smith, Hudnut and Frick in Baltimore City Court. The case got moved to Federal Court and a settlement was eventually reached on Dec. 10, 1985, that included returning Johnny Unitas memorabilia.\n\nHudnut, Indianapolis mayor from 1976 to 1992, now lives in Chevy Chase, Md. He has said the six-week period of attracting and landing the Colts was his favorite time as mayor. While considered the driving influence in the city's sports boom and Downtown revitalization, Hudnut has downplayed his role and credited predecessor Richard Lugar for getting the proverbial ball rolling.\n\nHudnut in 2012: We, as a city, had begun to think bigger under Mayor Lugar. So when I came into office, we started talking about what more we could do to make a mark, to enhance our economy and, to use a phrase, become a major league city. I don't care what the economists say about the inability of a team to enhance a city's economic base. It sure seems to me that in this case it did. The city has so much more vitality and there has been so much revitalization Downtown. To me, it's all paid off.\n\nFrick: I've got to confess, every March I think about (the move). Not many people have an opportunity to make such an impact on their community. I was very fortunate to have that opportunity, so I can't put it out of my mind.\n\nThe impact is so profound. It's the visual image of going to a game on a Sunday afternoon and seeing solid blue throughout the stadium, or the streets filled and the bars filled or you look at the number of people working at the game. The economic impact has been incredible, but the impact on the national scene was even more. It communicated to the entire country that Indianapolis is a great place.\n\nI had a unique experience (last) week. My wife had finally got me to do some touch-up painting at our house. I went in to buy a gallon of paint and the guy recognized me. It was only because the guy was 58 years old.\n\nRussell: The day after the move out, I got calls from our agents in Baltimore. They were really mad at me for Mayflower handling the move of their team. \"Do you know what's going to happen to my business this year? It's just going to go to hell. Nobody is going to call me.\" I said, \"Hold on, you know what they say about PR. There's no such thing as bad PR. Let's follow up and talk again as the year goes by.\" And we did. That year, they had a 20 percent increase in his business. It didn't affect him negatively at all. The agent apologized later for giving me such a hard time about it.\n\nMy boss, Johnny B., is the one that donated (the move). He gets the credit for that because it turned out to be a great PR vehicle for the company over the years. When the Colts and Baltimore play and they show that tape of the van pulling out in the snowy night, it's just getting Mayflower back on TV. Thirty years, it's been happening like that.\n\nLast week, I had a policeman visit to verify the ID numbers on my vehicles so I could register them in Florida. About halfway through our conversation, I mentioned that I used to work for Mayflower. He said, \"Oh really, I was a cop in Baltimore for 25 years.\" So here we go through the story again. It happens all the time. People remember it.\n\nRussell and his family are still diehard Colts fans.\n\nRussell: That's one thing we got out of the move. Bob let us go pick our season ticket seats and I've still got them. We've been to almost every game since. My four kids are Colts fans, they use the tickets more than I do, but yeah, I'm still a Colts fan.\n\nSo, too, is Hite.\n\nHite: As long as I don't say that in Baltimore, I'm fine.\n\nThe move's 30-year anniversary opens an old wound for Baltimore Colts fans, many of whom will never forgive nor forget. They blame Bob Irsay for everything. It doesn't matter that the city eventually landed another team, the Ravens, and that franchise has since won two Super Bowls.\n\nWard: I think it's worked out for both cities. They've won some Super Bowls. You still have people who are bitter about the Dodgers' move from Brooklyn and the (Oakland) Raiders' move. It's not unprecedented. There's always going to be some sensitive feelings.\n\nYou can't put the cause or the blame on any one person. It was a perfect storm, it came together, a lot of different factors. For me, it was kind of a surreal night. You certainly don't want to go through something like that twice in your life. It certainly was a stressful time. We've been in Indy for 30 years, we'll be here forever and we're so happy to be here.\n\nHerrmann, 55, eventually retired in his hometown. He works at St. Vincent Sports Performance Center and is a Colts radio analyst.\n\nHerrmann on heartbroken Baltimore fans: There's part of me that thinks, \"Yeah, move on, get over it.\" But then, families have grown up cheering for the horseshoe. To see that horseshoe move to Indianapolis, it probably would have been easier for the fans if they would have changed the (Colts) mascot and left that there. That would have eased the pain a little bit. Generations grew up with the Colts. There was that relationship, that feeling that this is our team and you took our team away. As pathetic as it is for those folks to hold this venom against the city of Indianapolis, there's a part down deep that appreciates the loyalty.\n\nLet's face it, this was a basketball city, a basketball state. To think of pro football in Indianapolis, yeah, that was kind of outside the realm of your thinking. Everything was so new and kind of exciting but people didn't know how to react to that team. And to think what it is 30 years later: Super Bowl championship, Super Bowl appearance, Peyton Manning has been through here, now you've got Andrew Luck, the fan base is as good as there is in the country. To think we would morph into that back then, I would have thought, \"No chance.\" But now I think it's a big league city. It's fun to think back 30 years ago to what it was and to think about what it is now. Amazing.\n\n***\n\nWilson writes for The Indianapolis Star", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/12/colorado-legal-marijuana-michigan/772263002/", "title": "Legalizing marijuana: What Michigan needs to learn from Colorado", "text": "DENVER — Ashley and Ryan picked Denver as the perfect spot for their weed-infused honeymoon.\n\nRobert, a well-to-do contractor from Houston, mixed a little R&R — reefer and recreation — with his latest business trip to Colorado. And Tyrell Towle, a chemist from Washington state, chose Denver as the spot for his home and job after getting a PhD degree in chemistry in Iowa.\n\nThe four have little in common, but there is one key thing that ties them together: marijuana.\n\nSince Colorado became one of the first states in the nation to legalize marijuana for recreational use, 3,051 marijuana businesses have been licensed in the state and more than 40,000 people are certified to work in the industry, translating into roughly 20,000 full-time positions working directly in marijuana businesses and thousands more jobs supplying those businesses, according to figures for the end of 2017.\n\nIt’s an industry that has exploded since Coloradans approved recreational use in 2012 and sales began on Jan. 1, 2014. The market has quickly grown into an industry that had $683 million in sales in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2017.\n\nIn Michigan, where the first licenses for medical marijuana businesses were awarded on Thursday, voters also will consider a ballot proposal on Nov. 6 to legalize marijuana in the state for recreational use, possibly becoming the 10th state in the nation and the first in the Midwest to free the weed.\n\nWith Michigan having nearly double the population of Colorado — 9.9 million to 5.6 million — and an already well-established market of 289,205 medical marijuana cardholders, both supporters and opponents of legalizing marijuana wonder (and worry) whether Michigan is on the same path as Colorado.\n\nDenver is the epicenter of the cannabis market in Colorado, home to more than 1,000 of the state’s marijuana businesses and more than a third of the state’s $1.5 billion in sales last year.\n\nThe dispensaries — 364 — are plentiful and some are instantly recognizable with green neon lights, green crosses and ubiquitous marijuana leaves. Others are more subtle with few indications of what lies behind the bulletproof glass and locked doors, where customers have to present their identification twice, once to get buzzed into the dispensary and a second time to buy a product.\n\n“This industry is beginning to grow up. It started out a little bit wild, but it’s really progressed into an absolute industry that’s a huge economic driver,” said Kim Casey, communications manager for Native Roots, a Denver-based company that started in 2009 with one medical marijuana dispensary and has grown to 600 employees at 20 dispensaries, several grow operations and a production facility. “That’s a huge impact for the state.”\n\nMore marijuana coverage:\n\n5 things I found surprising about legal marijuana in Colorado\n\nHow Michigan's marijuana proposal differs from Colorado law\n\nLegalize marijuana? Advice for Michigan from Colorado\n\nThe cannabis industry has helped to contribute to the state’s low unemployment rate, which, at 3 percent falls well below the U.S. rate of 3.9 percent and the 4.8 percent in Michigan. Construction cranes fill the skies over Denver, and rents for both housing and commercial real estate continue to increase above the national average.\n\n“I have friends who are actively involved in commercial real estate who have said that … they've seen an increase in terms of the per square footage rental rates as well as the cost of what used to be empty vacant buildings,” said Michael Hartman, director of the state Department of Revenue. “So there probably is some validity to the increases in the prices of commercial real estate.“\n\nAnd employers across the board are having a hard time finding workers to fill vacancies.\n\n“I’ve talked with other restaurant owners and everybody has a standing ad on Craig’slist at all times trying to fill jobs,” said Oren Cohen, a partner in the restaurant There, which has locations in Denver and Telluride and is competing with the cannabis and construction industries for employees. “As far as the (marijuana) consumer in Colorado, it’s all beautiful. But on the employer side, we’re constantly climbing uphill.”\n\nAndy Williams, founder and CEO of the family-owned Medicine Man and MedPharm, doesn’t feel too bad about poaching employees from other industries to fill the jobs at two large grow operations, three dispensaries and a research company that studies how marijuana can be used to treat a variety of diseases and ailments. The companies employ 130 people who are paid at least $15 an hour and often much more with full benefits.\n\n“Those are high-class problems for a state to have,” he said. “It’s great for people that their wages are getting higher.”\n\nTowle didn’t expect to end up working in the marijuana industry when he got his PhD in chemistry from the University of Iowa and began a job with a small chemical supply company in his home state of Washington.\n\n“But I saw a need and decided to jump,” said Towle, one of several chemists who works at MedPharm. “I never thought I would get into this business.”\n\nBut now he’s the director of chemistry and extraction at the company and doing research on how marijuana might help in the treatment of various ailments, including Alzheimer’s and dementia.\n\nHe’s one of 130 employees of the larger Medicine Man and MedPharm companies, founded by siblings Andy and Pete Williams in 2009. Pete had the green thumb and used it to grow exceptional marijuana for medical customers in the basement of his Colorado home. Andy was the entrepreneur with five or six or business ventures under his belt who convinced Pete to jump into the state’s medical marijuana business.\n\n“He’s been growing marijuana in his basement forever. He was making close to $150,000 a year out of his basement,” said Andy Williams. “So, in 2009, I went to him and said, 'let’s go big with this.' And we soon learned that growing in your basement and growing in a warehouse are two very different things.”\n\nNow the Williams’ other two siblings, Sally and Shelley, mom Michelle and five more extended family members help run the budding business, where one of the grow operations cultivates about 11,000 plants in 18 different growing rooms, producing about 75 pounds a day of finished, cured marijuana buds that sell for between $130 and $320 an ounce.\n\nNancy Whiteman made the unlikely leap from vice president of marketing for a large insurance company in Massachusetts to the owner of Wana Brands, one of the leading edibles companies in the nation famous for its potent marijuana-laced gummies with flavors such as mango, exotic yuzu, strawberry-lemonade and blueberry.\n\nThe market for edibles has been consistently growing as more people look for ways to avoid smoking marijuana. In January 2017, 766,872 units of edibles were sold and by December, that number had grown to 1,028,408 units.\n\n\"There have been a lot of those moments, when I say 'Oh my God, I’m in the marijuana business,' \" said the 59-year-old entrepreneur who oversees the company's 86 employees and production facilities in Boulder. \"When people ask me if I thought this was going to be my path, I just laugh. Some days, it's still a real surprise.\"\n\nShe got into the business in 2010 when she became a partner in a marijuana-infused soda company with a neighbor. That business fell apart, but she decided to explore the edibles market with her ex-husband. After the medical marijuana market expanded to the recreational side, \"we got committed on a whole different level and have seen 'hockey stick' growth. Last year alone, we grew 65%.\"\n\nNow, two shifts of workers make 60,000 sugar-coated gummies a day, which are packaged in containers of 10 pieces each that sell for $20 to $25.\n\nBoth Williams and Whiteman have plans for the potential market in Michigan.\n\n\"We have clients in Michigan and we’re helping them get licenses, design and build their facilities. And we help them get up and going,\" Williams said. \"But I have no plans for a grow operation in Michigan.\"\n\nBusiness owners in Colorado can't ship their products across state lines, so Whiteman is meeting with Michigan producers of marijuana-infused edibles to produce Wana Brands' line of candies in the state. The brand is already also in Oregon, Nevada and Arizona and working on launching in Florida and Illinois.\n\n\"When we go to different states, we’ve got to tweak the recipe because Michigan is probably a lot more humid than Colorado and it’s a lot more flat than Colorado,\" she said. \"So we have to make adjustments to the recipe just based on the location.\"\n\nEdibles come in especially handy in Colorado, since public consumption is illegal in the state, which has created challenges for people trying to take advantage of the lucrative tourism market that one study pegged at 60 percent of the marijuana sales in Colorado.\n\nThe public consumption ban translates into little to none of the instantly recognizable aroma of marijuana smoke on the streets of Denver. So tourists have to find other ways to consume the product they come to Colorado to enjoy. Whiteman pointed out that the edibles market provides a more discreet way to catch a buzz without the attention of patrolling police.\n\nRobert, the 38-year-old Houston businessman who combined his business trip with a little pleasure at a Denver dispensary last month, said he was going to catch a limousine ride with his wife to smoke the Sour Tsunami buds he bought along with an Alien Super Lemon Haze nightcap.\n\n\"When you’re out on the black market back home, you take what you can get,\" said Robert, who didn't want to give his last name. \"I can come to the budtender and say these are some of the ailments I’m dealing with and this is what I’m trying to achieve. Everyone here is extremely kind and articulate. It’s not the dirty back alley way.\"\n\nAt Adagio, a \"Bud and Breakfast\" Inn in Denver, a heavy layer of smoke hovered over the living room during the daily happy hour on a sunny Thursday last month. A group of seven people staying at the Adagio rolled and chain-smoked joints and filled bongs with buds and concentrates while enjoying the snacks — twice-baked potatoes, bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers, chips and salsa and a bundt cake, put out by the B&B's staff.\n\nThe visitors from Texas, New York and Arizona — states where recreational marijuana use is still illegal — were thrilled with the freedom to smoke without consequences.\n\n\"It felt great, smoking on the way here and then buying it,\" said Daisy Cruz, of Santa Rosa, Texas, as she fumbled to roll a blunt. \"It felt lovely. It’s beautiful — you know exactly what you’re buying.\"\n\nRyan, the 38-year-old truck driver from Phoenix who also didn't want to give his last name, said he asked his wife to sign off on a cannabis-friendly honeymoon.\n\n\"She put up some resistance at first, but once she looked into it and saw how chill it was, she said, 'this looks way better than a beach,' \" he said.\n\nAshley and Ryan, who got married in March, were taking full advantage of their weed-filled vacation. They got marijuana-infused massages, took a smoke-filled limousine tour on the ride from the airport to a dispensary to the B&B, and were planning to take a sushi and joint rolling class before they left for home.\n\n\"We’ve got kids and I’d rather plan a trip with them to the beach and then another trip for just us,\" said Ashley, 34. \"When you go on a cruise or to the beach, that’s all you do is drink and you get so hung over. Everyone is so much nicer when you’re just with a bunch of potheads.\"\n\nJoel and Lisa Schneider bought the bed and breakfast in 2014 out of necessity, said Kevin Fox, director of operations for the B&B.\n\n\"There was no place to smoke. People were putting towels underneath the door to make sure they didn't get kicked out of the hotel,\" he said. \"But this is a residential rather than hotel property. So we're allowed to smoke cannabis in the space.\"\n\nSome hotels discreetly advertise that they are marijuana-friendly, but only through vaping or edibles because the state has a smoking ban in all workplaces.\n\nSo places like Adagio are thriving.\n\n\"We don’t sell cannabis, we don’t infuse anything with cannabis. We just offer the ability to use cannabis in a safe environment,\" Fox said. \"And since we've opened, we've been at least 80 percent occupied.\"\n\nOthers are struggling. Two Denver tour bus companies, which offered a party-bus atmosphere with buds instead of beers and stops at dispensaries and grow operations, had to curtail their operations after getting busted by Denver City Police last month. The police cited a violation of the public consumption rules in issuing citations against 31 people on the tours.\n\nCompanies are fighting the crackdown, but don't have a friend in the office of Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat who isn't running for re-election this year because of term limits and who vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature earlier this year that would have allowed café-type consumption rooms to be set up adjacent to dispensaries.\n\n\"We expect all of our licensees, whether they're producers or distributors or tourist-related, to follow all of the rules and regulations both at the state level as well as their local licensing authority,\" said Hartman, who acknowledged that it was the City of Denver, not the state, that put the kibosh on the tour bus companies. \"From what I've read in the media reports, it sounds like Denver did the right thing by stepping into this situation.\"\n\nChallenges with accommodating tourists who want to partake isn't the only issue facing the marijuana industry.\n\nBanking remains a problem with marijuana entrepreneurs because the federal government still considers weed an illegal substance and most banks won't risk their federal approval by taking money from cannabis businesses. As a result, owners have to pay their employees, vendors and contractors with cash.\n\n\"It’s a very hard business to be in. We have banks that we’ve established relationships with. But we can’t take loans, or use credit cards,\" said Williams. \"It causes problems for our employees because their accounts get shut down when banks learn they’re employed by the marijuana industry. They can’t take out loans for homes or cars because their primary source of income is the marijuana industry. My kids' bank accounts were shut down just because I’m their father.\"\n\nAnd many of the businesses complained bitterly about a section of the federal tax code — 280E — that prohibits companies from writing off normal business expenses, such as payroll, rent and utilities, if the business involves the sale of an illegal substance. The rules translate into a federal tax rate for marijuana businesses of 70 percent to 80 percent.\n\n\"One of the biggest barriers to success for us is 280E,\" said Casey of Native Roots. \"It’s one of the largest hurdles in the industry. Especially for the newer companies who have to also come up with the money for the fees and startup costs.\"\n\n\"It's a big friggin' issue,\" added Williams. \"The IRS serves as judge, jury and executioner and says you're a drug trafficker. It's stealing and it keeps this industry from growing, which I think is their ultimate intent.\"\n\nOutside the industry, police saw a slight uptick in crashes and fatalities associated with drug-impaired driving after marijuana was legalized. But they're not sure how valid the numbers are because they weren't testing people for marijuana before it was legalized.\n\n\"When recreational marijuana was legalized, one of the first things we realized was that we didn't have any data for comparison purposes,\" said Sgt. Rob Madden, spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol. \"In Colorado, there is no difference between driving under the influence of alcohol or marijuana or methamphetamine. Everything goes under one statute.\"\n\nThe first year of legalization showed 674 driving-while-impaired-by-marijuana citations and that number has crept up slightly with a four-year average of 706 citations. Fatal crash statistics kept by the State Patrol don't differentiate between drunken or drugged driving as the cause, but those numbers went from 67 in 2015 to 91 in 2017.\n\nTroopers with the State Patrol train with dispensaries in the state to learn how to detect high drivers and look for things such as constricted eye pupils, forgetfulness and other telltale signs.\n\n\"I ask for their driver's license and they give me a credit card. I tell them that wasn’t their license and they hand me another credit card,\" Madden said. \"They’re not thinking, they’re not slowing down.\"\n\nWhen marijuana is suspected, police have to take the driver to a spot such as a hospital or fire station where their blood can be drawn, because while Breathalyzers can detect alcohol in a person's system, they can't pick up on weed. It's a costlier method for both local and state police, but the State Patrol, as well as the Michigan State Police, are also testing the accuracy of oral fluid testing.\n\nFor Madden, the glut of marijuana has tainted the state's reputation.\n\n\"I was at a conference in Florida and I introduced myself, and somebody said, 'So you brought all the snacks, right?' It’s just a continual joke,\" he said. \"I don’t want marijuana to be the state smell or the state flower of Colorado. I want it to be the beautiful scenery, the snowcapped mountains, the columbine flower.\"\n\nSome employers also have had issues with the legalization because of problems with workers. The law in Colorado still allows business owners to fire employees for violation of workplace rules, including using drugs on the job.\n\n\"We just hired a guy to be dishwasher. First day, he was on his game, and I thought, 'let’s do what we can to keep this young man around,' \" said restaurant owner Cohen. \" A few days passed, and his attitude is changing and the chef was looking for the dishwasher. He goes to the back door and there's this 22-year-old kid, who’s sitting there and realizes he got caught trying to hold in the smoke from his joint. He ended up burning his foot because he put the joint in his shoe.\n\n\"That young man doesn't work for us anymore.\"\n\nAnd while studies haven't shown a link between an increase in homelessness in Denver and the legalization of marijuana, service providers can't deny they're seeing more people since weed became legal in 2014. The streets around the shelters and in the popular 16th Street pedestrian mall in downtown Denver are well-populated with homeless people.\n\n\"It has impacted shelter providers. When it was first legalized, we did see an increase,\" said Tom Luehrs, executive director of the St. Francis Center, which provides services to more than 700 homeless people a day. \"But a lot of people wouldn’t admit that’s why they came here.\"\n\nOther studies, including ones done by Colorado State University at Pueblo and the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative, point to skyrocketing rents — a two-bedroom apartment ranges from $1,340 to $1,850 per month, according to the website Apartmentlist.com — as the reason the homeless population has gone up. Luehrs said it's hard to deny a link to legalization. While the Center was serving about 600 people a day before legalization, they're now up to 700-800 clients a day.\n\n\"One of the big causes for people becoming homeless is medical issues. You can say it’s drug addicts, but it’s really people who are struggling to live with disabilities that cause them a great deal of pain,\" he said. \"And they came to Colorado because they knew they wouldn’t be arrested.\"\n\nFor Annastasia Hudson, a 26-year-old homeless woman who returned to her home state of Colorado four months ago after suffering a stroke when her boyfriend in Texas choked her so violently that it ripped an artery, marijuana offers an escape.\n\n\"It’s everywhere. People in here are like super depressed and bored,\" she said, while hanging out at St. Francis. \"You go out into the courtyard and smoke a joint and it lifts everyone up. It just makes people a little bit happier about stuff in your life that sucks.\"\n\nWith marijuana legalization, however, comes money to fix some of those problems. The state was able to allocate more than $100 million of the marijuana tax revenue to issues that related to the legalization, including $15.3 million toward providing more affordable housing in the state and $40 million for a grant to improve existing schools and build new ones. More money went back to the communities that have allowed marijuana sales and the taxes also paid for the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which regulates the marijuana industry and employs 104 people.\n\nOther allocations run the gamut from mental health and substance abuse treatment services, drug prevention programs for youth, youth literacy programs, bullying prevention and a grant to the Institute of Cannabis Research at Colorado State University-Pueblo.\n\n\"We always tell people that if you're going to legalize it, don't do it for the tax revenue. The amount of effort and time that it takes and the amount of focus that it takes in order to have this in your state — it's intense,\" said Hartman, the revenue department director. \"Having said that, every incremental dollar is beneficial for governmental programs. So last year in 2017, on the calendar year basis, we collected $250 million dollars in taxes across the entire landscape. That's a significant amount of money and ... those dollars are put to good use.\"\n\nAnd it's hard to argue with the dollars that the industry is bringing into the state.\n\n\"The more people see these other states benefiting and bountifully benefiting, the more they'll support this,\" said newlywed Ryan, who voted for the first time in 2016 to legalize marijuana in Arizona, a ballot proposal that ultimately failed. \"What I’ve seen here for the last week is blowing my mind. I’m seeing the amount of money I’ve dropped in five days and how many jobs it's creating. They’re creating a whole other industry.\"\n\nPeter, a procurement director for a New York nonprofit agency who was also staying at the Adagio, was in Colorado for a weed-based vacation for the second time. This time it was to help celebrate a friend's 30th birthday.\n\n\"It’s sort of like a gold rush.\" he said. \"We’ve got Massachusetts and New Jersey, neighboring states that will have all these New York residents fleeing the state to go buy marijuana. Definitely, it's going to be a game changer.\"\n\nKathleen Gray covers the marijuana industry for the Detroit Free Press.

Kyle Sandler stood before Circuit Judge Christopher Hughes trembling as he pleaded guilty to a state theft charge. He apologized to the town of Opelika, where he previously admitted cheating dozens of people with promises of riches from high-tech businesses. The theft charge, involving a bad check of more than $2,500, was only a small piece of a scam authorities described as massive. Sandler founded a business called The Round House in 2014 and lured in investors while portraying himself as a wealthy former Google executive. He raised his profile by aligning himself with internet security pioneer John McAfee and promoting an area teen’s idea for a first aid vending machine.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nelson Angapak Sr. promised Sen. Ted Stevens to help Alaska Native veterans get another chance to apply for prized land allotments. It took two decades, but the 74-year-old Yup’ik leader has done it – with help from others, he points out. Congress passed a major lands bill in March that opens the door for more Native veterans to apply for tracts of land of up to 160 acres. It follows a more limited application period in 1998, an opportunity many veterans said wasn’t enough. The allotments were offered to Alaska Natives by the federal government beginning in 1906, after non-Native settlers and miners began arriving in the state and claiming Native lands. The program’s original restrictions prevented many from applying until the 1960s, says Kevin Illingworth, professor of tribal management at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The program ended in 1971, before many of the Natives in the military returned to Alaska from service in Vietnam.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A border activist charged with helping a pair of migrants with water, food and lodging is set to go on trial in U.S. court. Defendant Scott Daniel Warren has argued that his spiritual values compel him to help all people in distress. The trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Tucson, with Warren, 36, charged with harboring migrants and conspiring to transport and harbor two Mexican men found with him who were in the U.S. illegally. Thousands of migrants have died crossing the border since the mid-1990s, when heightened enforcement pushed traffic into Arizona’s scorching deserts. Prosecutors say the two migrants aided by Warren were never in any real distress.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas’ board of trustees has voted to increase tuition or fees at virtually every campus in the school’s system. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that trustees approved raising tuition and fees Thursday at a rate lower than 3% at four of the five four-year universities. The decision comes after three other Arkansas public universities boosted tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year. A year earlier, all Arkansas public colleges and universities had frozen tuition prices at Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s request. The University of Arkansas in Little Rock’s tuition freeze is notable because the school faces a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall in the forthcoming year. The university elected to keep tuition at its existing level, hoping it will boost enrollment and tuition revenue.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: Family members, friends and fans attended a Southern California beach memorial for Dick Dale, the late King of the Surf Guitar. The Orange County Register says a crowd gathered Sunday at the Huntington Beach Pier to remember Dale, who died in April at age 81. A group of surfers then took to the water for a “paddle-out,” the traditional ceremony held for fellow surfers when they die. Dale played pounding, blaringly loud power-chord instrumentals in the 1960s on songs like “Miserlou” and “Let’s Go Trippin.” An avid surfer, he built a devoted fan base across greater Los Angeles starting in the late 1950s. Dale says he developed his style by trying to merge the sounds of crashing ocean waves with rockabilly melodies.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: More than 1,700 people walking on a University of Colorado campus were unknowingly photographed as part of a facial recognition research project. The Denver Post reported Monday that professor Terrance Boult set up a long-range surveillance camera in an office window at the Colorado Springs campus. It captured more than 16,000 images of passersby during the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. Boult says the images were collected to create a dataset as part of an effort to enhance facial recognition technology. The dataset was made publicly available online in 2016, but it was taken down in April. Boult says he waited five years to release the dataset online to protect student privacy. University spokesman Jared Verner says a panel reviewed the research protocol for the project.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed a bill that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. The current minimum wage of $10.10 an hour will climb through gradual increases for the next several years under the law signed Tuesday. The Democratic governor signed the law at the Parkville Care Center in Hartford. He said the increases will help lift workers out of poverty, reduce pay disparities among races and genders, and stimulate the state’s economy. An estimated 130,000 workers are expected to benefit from the first increase planned for October, when the minimum wage will climb to $11 an hour. Opponents have argued the legislation will be another cost for employers.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Wanting to remember the 360 Wilmingtonians killed in World War II, a city native has launched a website to ensure their ultimate sacrifices and achievements will never be taken for granted. A Tribute to Wilmington’s Greatest Generation names every resident killed during WWII and provides snippets explaining who they were before the war. The website also has newspaper clippings about the warriors, as well as what was going on in Wilmington at the time. “As we get further away from that period ... I kind of wanted to do something to keep that memory alive,” says Nathan Field, the website’s creator. The idea for the website developed as Field would see names on plaques honoring those who died in wars, but little else, and would wonder, “Who were they?”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The founding director of the Smithsonian’s museum about African American history will now lead the entire system of museums and parks. The Smithsonian Institution on Tuesday named Lonnie Bunch as its 14th secretary. Bunch was the first director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. He’ll now lead the world’s largest museum, education and research complex, with 19 museums and the National Zoological Park. Bunch becomes the first African American to lead the Smithsonian, beginning his new position June 16. He’ll be replaced as interim director by Spencer Crew. Bunch was hired in 2005 and shepherded the collection of more than 40,000 items and the creation of the museum on the National Mall. It opened in 2016.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: The Naples Zoo is celebrating the birth of three African lion cubs. The zoo announced the birth of the cubs – the institution’s first in 30 years – on Thursday; one was born May 13, and two were born May 14. The cubs and their mother, 13-year-old Shani, may be exhibited late this summer. The zoo says it will host a contest to name the cubs. It says zoo workers haven’t gotten close enough to the cubs to know their genders or weights, but the cubs are being monitored through video feeds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies African lions as vulnerable to extinction. They’re endangered by illegal hunting, declining prey populations and habitat loss.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: More than a third of small towns in the state lost population in the past year, highlighting the challenges of reviving rural areas. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports new census estimates show that Camilla fell below 5,000 residents. Sparks fell below 2,000, Fort Gaines dropped below 1,000, and Milan fell to 661 residents, for a loss of 7% of its population. All four towns are in South Georgia. Meanwhile, Georgia’s cities are growing. Atlanta grew more than 1% in the past year and is now nearing the half-million-resident mark. The city now boasts 498,044 residents and will cross 500,000 next year if current growth rates continue. The trend is hardly a new one, but continued population losses have raised questions about whether rural areas can do anything to reverse the tide.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Big waves and high tides in the state will make shoreline erosion and flooding likely this summer. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports a University of Hawaii at Manoa geologist has predicted a “regional anomaly” is likely to produce tides 2-4 inches higher than levels noted on charts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there will be 36 days with peak high tides above 2.2 feet in June, July and August. Geologist Dolan Eversole, who works with the Waikiki Beach Special Improvement District, says the highest tide will be 2.6 feet on July 31. Eversole says that an anomaly involving cyclical high water levels and Pacific winds will cause levels higher than those predicted by NOAA and that, combined with big waves, these high tides make shoreline inundations and erosion likely.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Twelve farm workers and ten others were treated at the West Valley Medical Center and decontaminated by a hazmat team Sunday night. KTVB-TV reports the Caldwell Fire Department said the workers were exposed to an unknown substance at a field near Wilder in eastern Idaho, and all began to experience flu-like symptoms. They then all went to the medical center for treatment. Caldwell Fire treated the first patient and then requested help by the State Office of Emergency Management, which sent the Region 3 Hazmat Team to help decontaminate the other patients. Officials did not release what the substance was to which the workers were exposed or why another ten people had to be treated and decontaminated at the hospital.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Chicago says it will be the first U.S. university to create a school of molecular engineering, thanks to a $100 million donation. The university announced Tuesday that the new school will be known as the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, supported by a gift from the Pritzker Foundation. The university’s first school in engineering and its first new school in three decades will aim to find new solutions for pressing global challenges, including immunotherapy-based approaches to cancer and the search for sustainable energy. University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer says the gift will help expand work already underway with Argonne National Laboratory. The foundation is led by relatives of Gov. J.B. Pritzker, including former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at northern Indiana’s Grissom Air Reserve Base is working to raise $300,000 toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders plan an exhibit space resembling one of the huts that housed the bombers when they were stationed at the base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber. Museum Director Tom Jennings tells the Kokomo Tribune the B-58 is the museum’s crown jewel. The museum raised about $90,000 during a reunion of B-58 veterans and hopes to start construction later this year. Museum officials say nearly half of the 116-aircraft fleet was stationed at what is now Grissom, and only eight such planes remain.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A food festival this weekend offers the chance ton enjoy pizza for seven solid hours. Ankeny’s fourth annual Pizza Fest is taking place from 4 to 11 p.m. Saturday at the new Town Square Park near The District in Ankeny’s Prairie Trail. Festivalgoers can taste pizza and other foods from area pizzerias, restaurants and food truck vendors. Domestic and local craft beers, wine and specialty cocktails will also be available along with games and live music. Admission is free. Pizza lovers can enter an eating contest, and vendors will be vying for votes to be named the Best of the Fest 2019. Attendees can try each food vendor’s entry for $1. Along with pizza, entries will include pizza corn dogs, pizza-dillas, pizza mac and cheese, pizza egg rolls and other tasty pizza creations.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Tiger and lion pelts seized from wildlife traffickers have been donated to zoos in Topeka and Wichita. U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said Friday that his office donated pelts that were seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during investigations of a black market for hides and other parts of protected wildlife. Many of the wildlife items forfeited or abandoned during federal investigations are donated to educational facilities and nonprofit organizations to teach about endangered species. Fish and Wildlife Service agents used some of the pelts in a sting operation in 2018 that resulted in a Wichita man pleading guilty and agreeing to pay $8,000 for two tiger pelts. Agents seized a lion pelt from his home.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: The destruction of chemical weapons stored in the state since the 1940s is set to begin. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that destruction of chemical agents including mustard, sarin and VX will begin in June after decades of planning and preparations. The weapons are stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, and a company called Blue Grass Chemical Activity is responsible for their destruction. The Blue Grass Army Depot and Blue Grass Chemical Activity say about 1,200 workers are set to eliminate more than 100,000 chemical-filled munitions stored in earth-covered igloos by 2023. Project manager Ronk Hink says crews have spent about four years training and methodically testing equipment and processes to make sure the plant is prepared for the operation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The French government has added a house in the city where the French painter Edgar Degas lived briefly to a network of houses of famous French people. Degas House Museum owner David Villarrubia says the bed and breakfast will be able to display a large red medallion showing it is part of the “Maisons des Illustres.” Degas visited relatives there for 4 1/ 2 months in 1872-73. Villarrubia says he was notified late last year and expects the medallion in July. He says the network includes 236 houses, but only four are outside of France and its territories, with only one other in the United States. France’s Ministry of Culture created the designation in 2011 to encourage people to visit homes representing French history and culture.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is on track to come up with a plan to become a net exporter of energy by 2030. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills recently signed the bill into law as part of efforts to promote renewable energy. Democratic Rep. Brian Hubbell has said renewable energy such as hydropower, wind and biomass already makes up 36% of Maine’s total energy usage. Federal data shows imported carbon fuels produce 90 of the 120 terawatt-hours of energy that Maine consumes each year. The legislation directs the Governor’s Energy Office to analyze how the state can become a net exporter of energy by 2030. The state could do that by developing and expanding its energy generating capacity, energy conservation and energy efficiency efforts at a level to offset Maine’s domestic energy consumption.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The speaker of the House of Delegates has called for the removal of a Statehouse plaque that honors the Civil War’s Union and Confederate soldiers. Speaker Adrienne A. Jones said last week that the plaque “sympathizes with Confederate motivations and memorializes Confederate soldiers.” The Democrat shared her concerns in a letter to the State House Trust, which oversees alterations to the Capitol building. The Baltimore Sun reports that the plaque features the American flag and the Confederate flag crossed over the words, “Maryland Remembers.” The plaque says its purpose is to ensure that Maryland remembers the “nearly 63,000 native sons who served in the Union forces and the more than 22,000 in those of the Confederacy.” Jones sits on the State House Trust, which would need to approve the plaque’s removal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBrookline: The National Park Service is marking two Kennedy milestones this week. On Wednesday, events are planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site at JFK’s boyhood home in Brookline. That same day would have been the slain president’s 102nd birthday. Organizers say a special commemoration will be held starting at 10 a.m. with the theme, “What JFK means to me.” At 2 p.m., presidential biographers Fredrik Logevall, David Nasaw and Barbara Perry will participate in a panel discussion examining the legacy of the nation’s 35th president. The park service leads tours of the house where the Kennedy family began its rise to national prominence. Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in western Michigan has opened a new attraction – on the roof. The Stuart and Barbara Padnos Rooftop Sculpture Garden is located atop the recently completed 22,000-square-foot Covenant Learning Center. The rooftop garden is part of the $115 million “Welcoming the World: Honoring a Legacy of Love” expansion project. It’s designed to enhance the mission of the Grand Rapids-area attraction of promoting an appreciation for gardens, sculpture, the natural environment and the arts. The rooftop garden offers a habitat for birds, butterflies and insects. It has four long-term loans from the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Residents may believe this past winter was rough, but state health officials say it wasn’t bad enough to kill off the deer ticks that carry Lyme disease. Dave Neitzel, an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, told Minneapolis Public Radio that the cold kills ticks only if the insects are exposed to the air. He says the ticks mostly survived the harsh cold by staying insulated under a thick blanket of snow. Early results from health department field surveys indicate there are more deer ticks now compared to this time last year. Deer ticks carry Lyme disease, which causes fever and fatigue, joint damage and, if left untreated, heart and neurological problems. Neitzel urges outdoor enthusiasts to protect themselves with repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The National Park Service is considering dismantling some historic buildings in the state because nobody has been willing to lease or restore them. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the nine cottages and two outbuildings are in the Tupelo Homestead Historic District. Built in 1936 by the Resettlement Administration and transferred to the National Park Service in 1940, they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Four years ago, Natchez Trace Parkway officials tried to gauge public and private interest in preserving some of the cottages that sit near its headquarters. Last year, the parkway sought proposals but received none. A news release says the parkway cannot afford to maintain the buildings. The colony of cottages originally had 35 homesteads.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo is planning an $11.5 million expansion of its area for primates, adding 35,000 square feet of outdoor space that will include trails and tunnels for observers to get a close-up view. Monkeys, chimps and their cousins have long been among the most popular of the 17,000 animals at the zoo, even if the Primate House where they live is aging. Curator of primates Heidi Hellmuth says the new Primate Canopy Trails, expected to open in 2021, allows the animals to spend much of their time outside. Meanwhile, visitors will be able to get remarkably close. Those entering the primate area will walk through a ground-level glass tunnel. Overhead mesh tunnels between existing sycamore trees will let people observe the animals as they move and play.\n\nMontana\n\nAnaconda: The state’s congressional delegation is protesting the planned closure of an Anaconda Job Corps center by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Montana Standard reports that the Anaconda Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center will close in August. The center opened in 1966 and provides training in manufacturing, mechanics, carpentry and other disciplines. The department says it plans to close nine centers across the country to better serve students at higher-performing centers. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte are urging Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to reconsider the decision. Bill Everett, the Anaconda center’s CEO, says it’s one of Anaconda’s biggest employers and keeps many youth out of trouble by providing them with vital job skills and employment opportunities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Just as summer is finally coming into view, a local museum is kicking off its search for the perfect Christmas tree. The Durham Museum is searching for the official tree for its annual Christmas at Union Station celebration. Every year, the museum receives submissions from Omaha-area residents offering to donate their evergreen tree for display. The tree selected must meet certain benchmarks, including that it be over 40 feet tall, have a single, straight trunk, have a uniform shape and be in a spot where it can be safely removed. This year’s tree will be cut down on Nov. 18, and a tree-lighting ceremony is set for Nov. 29. Residents wishing to donate an evergreen tree may contact The Durham at 402-444-5071 before Aug. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nBaker: A 137-year-old rifle found five years ago leaning against a juniper tree in Great Basin National Park is now part of an exhibit dedicated to the “Forgotten Winchester” at the park visitor center, in Nevada near the Utah border. The weathered Winchester Model 1873 is in a case designed to capture the way it looked when park archaeologist Eva Jensen stumbled across it on a rocky outcrop above Strawberry Creek during an archaeological survey. Based on its condition, experts believe the weapon might have been abandoned in the forest more than a century ago. But nearly five years after its discovery, park officials still don’t know to whom it belonged or why it was left against the tree. The exhibit also highlights the role the Model 1873 – one of the most popular guns on the Western frontier – played in the history of the West.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Fish and Game Department is reminding people not to interfere if they see fawns by themselves. The majority of deer fawns are born in May and June. People may see fawns alone and try to help them, but the doe usually isn’t far off, waiting to return to feed her newborn offspring. The department says adult deer can be easily detected by predators, due to their scent and size. Does will spend extended periods away from their fawns to disassociate their scent from the fawn and keep them safe from predators. People who try to help usually are removing fawns from the mother’s care. Improper care of injured or orphaned wildlife often leads to animals’ sickness or death. People can call in a report if there’s a concern.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Several months after a false start, the state has issued new rules for microbreweries. The guidelines released Tuesday cover how many events breweries can host, who is allowed to drink on-premises and whether they can serve food. Last fall, the state issued rules that prompted opposition from some microbrewery owners who said they would hurt business, so the state’s Division of Alcohol and Beverage Control decided to suspend the process and do more study. The guidelines are updates to a 2012 law that allowed breweries to serve their products on-site. Bar and restaurant owners have voiced concern that the breweries are diluting the value of their liquor licenses, which are limited in number and can cost well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nShiprock: Ranchers in northwestern New Mexico suspect toxic plants are responsible for the recent deaths of more than a dozen cows. The Gallup Independent reports at least 15 cows from different herds in the Shiprock area have died of a mysterious illness in the past three weeks. And ranchers say the purple plant known as the tall mountain larkspur is the likely cause. The plant is growing in abundance on the range thanks to unusually wet weather. It is used in Navajo and Hopi religious ceremonies and as after-birth wash. Navajo botanist and geologist Arnold Clifford says the plant is toxic to cows because of its high concentrations of alkaloid. He says because the Shiprock range is nearly devoid of forage, cattle tend to supplement their diet with any plant species just to fill their stomachs.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Three years after graduation, the “dorm chef” is still cooking up culinary buzz. Jonah Reider became a media sensation as a Columbia University senior booted from his dorm for running a sophisticated supper club there. His club, Pith, now has a new incarnation in a high-rise apartment near Wall Street. Reider flew overseas this spring to make a pilot for Japanese television. And he’s planning a grilled cheese sandwich shop in Tokyo. He’s also launched a company that sells honey, salt and olive oil infused with CBD nationally, as well as with THC in Oregon. Despite all that, Reider says he doesn’t want to be known as a chef. He tells the Associated Press he’s trying to inspire people to cook at home for friends and family rather than overspending at restaurants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Every time 28-year-old Poet Williams applies for a job, his arrest record comes up: three nonviolent misdemeanors. Those drug charges have followed the Durham resident since he was 21, barring him from jobs, apartments and opportunities. Soon, however, he may be able to remove those offenses from his record. The state Senate recently passed legislation loosening the requirements to expunge a criminal record. Offenders could wipe out multiple nonviolent misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions, regardless of age, and the bill expands expunctions for misdemeanors and minor felonies committed by 16- and 17-year olds. Currently, only nonviolent, first-time convictions qualify. Crimes that require sex offense registration and traffic infractions couldn’t be expunged. “The Second Chance Act” measure now goes to the House, where organizers say it stands a good chance of passing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum’s office says nearly 70 people have applied to serve on a panel that’s seen as key to implementing a voter-approved constitutional amendment aimed at government ethics reform. Those who submitted applications by Friday’s deadline include several former lawmakers, lobbyists, farmers, tribal members, a Boy Scout leader and a newspaper editor. The Republican-led Legislature was successful in pushing its own bill aimed at ethics reform to meet the requirements of the constitutional amendment. But it wasn’t what Democrats and others who pushed for the ethics reform wanted. The constitutional amendment still allows the new commission to write its own rules for ethics reform. The governor, as well as Senate majority and minority leaders, must agree by consensus on who sits on the panel, which is expected to be chosen by July 1.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The First Amendment right to free speech is no laughing matter, as illustrated by a new exhibit at the world’s largest cartoon library, Ohio State University’s Bille Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum. The political cartooning display runs the gamut from a 1774 etching by Paul Revere criticizing Britain’s use of tea as a political weapon to a 2018 cartoon lampooning the blocking of online conservative commentary. Other cartoons take on political correctness, flag desecration, fake news, campus conduct codes and the role of Twitter in public discourse. Museum founder Lucy Caswell co-curated the exhibit with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes. “Front Line: Editorial Cartoonists and the First Amendment” runs through October.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state attorney general’s office says the state Supreme Court should reject a proposed petition to expand Medicaid because the summary contradicts the body of the petition concerning income eligibility for the public health insurance program. The petition was filed on behalf of two residents in April. It would modify Oklahoma’s constitution to extend the federal-state health insurance program to eligible low-income adults. The Oklahoman reports that the attorney general’s office said in a court briefing Thursday that the proposed petition is otherwise constitutional. The petition’s supporters also filed a brief with the court Thursday insisting that the Supreme Court maintain the petition’s language and its constitutionality. The Oklahoma Supreme Court is slated to hear the case’s oral arguments June 18.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: One of the state’s most popular wilderness trails will remain closed into the beginning of this summer, almost two years after a large wildfire closed it down in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. The Whitewater Trail, the most common route to the popular backcountry campsites of Jefferson Park, had its closure order extended into August, the U.S. Forest Service said last week. The trail was heavily damaged by the Whitewater Fire that burned in July 2017. Crews worked last summer and fall to fix the trail, but more trees died over the winter and spring, leaving a mess on the road and at the trailhead. Detroit district ranger David Halemeier says crews need additional time to clean out the area before reopening it to the public.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A local theater company is bringing Shakespeare to the site of a once-mighty steel company’s blast furnace. Quantum Theatre is using the backdrop of the Carrie Furnace for its production of “King Lear,” the bard’s darkest tragedy. It tells of grief and madness, family values gone wrong and a powerful king brought low. The theater company’s artistic director and founder says being at the site gives a sense of the enormity of the steel industry and the enormity of its collapse. Karla Boos says those are wonderful metaphors for “King Lear.” The Carrie Furnaces are the last remaining structures of what was once the thrumming heart of the Homestead Steel Works. The company produced steel used in the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other iconic structures. The play runs through Sunday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Many items in the state archives, including Rhode Island’s copy of the Bill of Rights, are at risk of damage because they’re kept in a building that’s not meant for preserving rare, historic documents, according to an assessment released Tuesday. There isn’t enough space to store or exhibit them properly, and water, light, dust and atmospheric pollution pose a risk to many of the items, according to the report by the Northeast Document Conservation Center. The collection has been housed since 1990 in a rented office building in a flood zone in downtown Providence. An estimated 35% of the collection should be considered a high priority for conservation, the center found. That includes the draft of the Bill of Rights sent to Rhode Island for its consideration, a map of the Revolutionary War Battle of Rhode Island and a printing of the Declaration of Independence from 1823.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSullivans Island: The extreme heat that’s been scorching the Deep South prompted the closure of a swinging bridge to a beach town for several hours. The state Department of Transportation says the heat caused the steel in the Ben Sawyer Bridge to Sullivans Island to expand, preventing the bridge from fully closing after it was opened Monday. The DOT said on Twitter that crews cooled the steel with water from a firetruck, then locked the bridge once it could close. Transportation officials say they will keep the bridge locked until they can fix the steel, giving it more room to expand. The closing left only one way on and off Sullivans Island and the Isle of Palms at the end of the Memorial Day weekend. The high Sunday and Monday in Charleston was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrookings: A Brookings High School student has captured the first-place award in an international science competition for his project aimed at fighting the opioid epidemic. Fourteen-year-old Aditya Tummala developed a gummy-like substance, similar to a gummy bear, that would make an opioid pill tamper-proof, meaning the medication couldn’t be crushed or melted for snorting or injecting. KSFY-TV says the project garnered first place at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, Arizona. Tummala calls the product Tampr-X.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Back in 1993, when Eric Friedl decided to start the Goner Records label – putting out a limited vinyl release from Japanese noise-rockers Guitar Wolf – he did it because “their music was so wild that I didn’t think there was a label that would dare release anything by them.” Back then, Friedl couldn’t have expected Goner would be going, bigger and better than ever, 25 years on. But in 2019, Goner is its own little empire: one that includes a still-flourishing label, a thriving retail store and the annual Gonerfest concert extravaganza, which draws bands and fans from all over the world each September. To mark Goner’s silver anniversary, the company is throwing a party this weekend. Goner25 is a three-day bash that will include a performance by Guitar Wolf and other longtime label acts and supporters like The 5.6.7.8’s, Royal Pendletons, Jack Oblivian and Bloodshot Bill, plus film screenings and other fun.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A new study says housing sales in the state would decline, gasoline prices would spike and the state’s economic output would drop by hundreds of billions of dollars if another major storm struck an unprotected coastline. The joint economic impact study by Texas A&M University at Galveston and the Texas General Land Office evaluated storm surge impacts on the three counties along Galveston Bay – Galveston, Harris and Chambers. The Houston Chronicle reports it also examined how flooding from a major storm would affect local and national economies. Hurricane Harvey swamped the area in August 2017, making landfall near Corpus Christi with 130 mph sustained winds and torrential rains. The study was conducted before the Army Corps of Engineers’ October proposal for a 74-mile barrier to avert future hurricanes.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Becoming one of the 10 approved medical marijuana growers in the state’s new program won’t be cheap. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the state plans to charge a $10,000 application fee and an additional $100,000 annual licensing fee for those chosen, according to draft rules for Utah’s new medical marijuana program published last week. State officials say the license fees are meant to offset the expense of adding personnel and equipment to inspect the growing facilities. If all 10 grower licenses are granted, revenues to the agriculture department could top $1.1 million the first year and hover around $1 million over the following years as cultivators pay the renewal fee. The state’s agricultural department expects to spend more than $560,000 each year to oversee cannabis cultivation and plant sales.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The annual survey of homelessness in the state says the number of people who were homeless on one night in January was down 15.5% from last year. The 2019 Point-in-Time Count Report was released this month by the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness and the Chittenden County Homeless Alliance. The survey, which was conducted Jan. 23, found that 1,089 Vermonters were homeless that day. That represented a decrease of 202 people from the 2018 count. The Point-in-Time Count allows local communities and state policy makers to understand the current problems of homelessness, target limited funding to appropriate housing and services, and track progress in reducing homelessness. Among other findings, the survey determined that 245 homeless people were under age 18, the same percentage as 2018.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Inflatable rafts, trashed awnings, red cups and towels amounted to 10 tons of garbage left on the shore at Chic’s Beach following a Memorial Day weekend event. Floatopia, a massive start-of-summer party at Chic’s Beach, drew hundreds of people Sunday for a day of drinking and lounging in the Chesapeake Bay, WCNC-TV reports, but photos of the messy aftermath spread quickly online. A crew of only nine people arrived Monday morning to clean up the 20,000-pound mess, Virginia Beach Public Works spokesman Drew Lankford said. “It was food wrappers, cans, bottles, pieces of floats, towels, everything,” he told WCNC-TV. Lankford told WCNC-TV that Floatopia is organized largely on social media, making communication with the event’s organizers difficult.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Wildfire responders in western Washington are preparing for a particularly bad wildfire season. With less precipitation than normal so far in 2019 and snowpack in the North Cascades depleting rapidly, conditions are already abnormally dry, and much of the western side of the state has been declared in or at risk of drought. “It’s going to be a dry summer, and any outdoor burns are going to be risky,” Skagit County Deputy Fire Marshal Mark Anderson told the Skagit Valley Herald. “We saw that in March.” During that unusually dry month, 21 outdoor burns in the county got out of control. Deputy Fire Marshal Bonnie LaCount said the largest escalated into a 21-acre fire in the Rockport area. The second largest was a 5-acre, wind-driven fire in Clear Lake.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: A Korean War-era tank near the entrance to a local park turned bright lemon-lime yellow thanks to a mix-up with paint colors. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports city officials were initially unable to explain the color change. Then the sponsor of a Bluefield State College science fiction club sent a letter to the paper. Jerry Conner said the U.S.S. Yeager Chapter of Starfleet International has been cleaning and painting the tank for about 20 years. “We took a sample of the color to a Bluefield merchant and purchased two gallons which was supposed to match our sample,” Conner said in the letter. “We were worried when we opened the containers and found something nowhere near our sample.” Club members assumed the paint would turn olive drab once it dried, Conner said. It didn’t.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state might be best known for its beer offerings, but its wineries are drawing tourists from across the Upper Midwest. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that a Michigan State University study estimated 1.78 million visits were made to Wisconsin’s winery tasting rooms in 2015, bringing in nearly $50 million in wine tourism. The study’s author, Dan McCole, is an associate professor of tourism and sustainability at Michigan State University. McCole found that most people don’t visit Wisconsin’s wineries to learn about wine but rather for leisure, such as family gatherings. He says the state’s wineries are easy to get to from bigger cities, and Wisconsin doesn’t need to produce the highest-quality wines. He says visitors are looking for a good experience.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A federal report shows visitors to Yellowstone National Park spent nearly $513 million in neighboring communities last year. The report last week from the National Park Service indicates the spending by the park’s 4.1 million visitors supported nearly 7,100 jobs in the area in 2018. According to the report, the more than 468,000 visitors to Devils Tower National Monument in northeast Wyoming spent $30 million last year, supporting more than 400 jobs. The park service recorded more than 318 million visitors nationwide. The report shows they spent more than $20 billion in communities within 60 miles of parks to support 329,000 jobs. Of the nationwide visitor spending, nearly $7 billion was on lodging expenses and $4 billion on restaurants and bars.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/fact-check-republican-governor-nominees-2020-election/index.html", "title": "More than half of GOP governor nominees have questioned or ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Republican nominee in at least 22 of this year’s 36 gubernatorial races is someone who has rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.\n\nThe 22 candidates on the list so far have expressed varying views about the 2020 election. Some have falsely proclaimed the election stolen; some others have been evasive when asked if Biden’s victory was legitimate. Some incumbents endorsed a 2020 lawsuit that sought to overturn Biden’s win but have said little about the election since; some first-time candidates made false election claims a focus of their successful 2022 primary campaigns.\n\nRegardless, the presence of a large number of 2020 deniers, deceivers and skeptics on general election ballots in November raises the prospect of a crisis of democracy in the 2024 presidential election in which former President Donald Trump is widely expected to run again. Governors play a major role in elections – signing or vetoing legislation about election rules, sometimes unilaterally changing those rules, appointing key election officials, and, critically, certifying election results.\n\nIt is possible that some swing states will have their 2024 elections run by both a governor and elections chief who have vehemently rejected Biden’s victory.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, both Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem are conspiracy theorists who want to overturn Biden’s 2020 win in the state. In Pennsylvania, where the governor gets to nominate the election chief, the Republican gubernatorial nominee is Doug Mastriano, a fervent election denier who has taken various steps to try to reverse the 2020 result. Both Republican nominees in Michigan, Tudor Dixon for governor and Kristina Karamo for secretary of state, have falsely claimed Trump won the state in 2020.\n\nCNN will update this article if we find information showing that Biden’s victory has been disputed by other Republican nominees.\n\nAlabama: Kay Ivey\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey declares victory in her Republican primary race as she speaks at her election watch party in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday May 24, 2022. Mickey Welsh/AP\n\nIn April, during the Republican primary, incumbent Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey released an ad in which she falsely claimed, “The fake news, Big Tech and blue state liberals stole the election from President Trump.” Challenged about the ad by local television station WVTM 13, Ivey said she believes Trump was the rightful winner. (He lost.)\n\nThe Ivey campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlaska: Mike Dunleavy\n\nAlaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy speaks with reporters about the recently ended legislative session on Thursday, May 19, 2022, in Juneau, Alaska. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer) Becky Bohrer/AP\n\nIncumbent Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy supported the Texas lawsuit that tried in December 2020 to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s victories in four states. When an interviewer asked Dunleavy in December 2020 – a month after television networks unofficially declared Biden the winner – how he would manage Alaska’s relationship with “President-elect Biden,” Dunleavy said that “I’m not there yet, that there’s a new president.” He added that there was an “outside chance” that there would be a Biden administration – though, in fact, that was overwhelmingly likely.\n\n“If there is any suspicion of fraud, which there is, that really needs to be looked into. That really needs to be investigated,” Dunleavy said, though there was no evidence at the time of widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome. “That really needs to be determined, I think by the courts, that if it does exist, then it needs to be rectified. If it doesn’t exist, then that needs to be proven as well.”\n\nOn the day Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, reporter James Brooks, then with the Anchorage Daily News and now with the Alaska Beacon, asked Dunleavy if Biden won the election legitimately. Dunleavy would not respond directly, saying, “Joe Biden won this election. Joe Biden was – has been sworn in today. So he is the president.” Though Brooks asked two more times if Dunleavy believes Biden won legitimately, Dunleavy again avoided a straight answer.\n\nIn July 2022, the Anchorage Daily News reported that “Dunleavy did not respond to several questions sent to his campaign spokesman about his position on the 2020 election results.” A Dunleavy campaign spokesperson told the newspaper that Dunleavy would remain focused on his own race.\n\nDunleavy succeeded in Alaska’s top-four primary in August, advancing to the general election as the leading Republican in the race. The Dunleavy campaign did not respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nArizona: Kari Lake\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate for Arizona Kari Lake speaks to supporters during a campaign event at the Whiskey Roads Restaurant & Bar on July 31, 2022 in Tucson, Arizona Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nArizona Republican nominee Kari Lake has put false claims about the 2020 election at the center of her campaign – repeatedly and falsely declaring the election “stolen” and even calling it “disqualifying” and “sickening” that her top rival in the party primary wouldn’t say the same. In an interview with The New York Times in early August, after primary voters had cast their ballots, Lake said of Biden: “Deep down, I think we all know this illegitimate fool in the White House – I feel sorry for him – didn’t win.”\n\nLake, a former longtime local news anchor at a Fox station in Phoenix, has said she would not have certified Biden’s victory in Arizona if she had been governor. She has continued, even in 2022, to demand the decertification of the Biden-won states of Arizona and Wisconsin, though that is a legal impossibility.\n\nLake has made numerous false claims about the 2020 election. She has falsely claimed Biden didn’t receive 81 million votes he indeed received, falsely claimed Trump won Arizona, though he actually lost by more than 10,000 votes, and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about the vote count and about election technology company Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nLake has advocated for the imprisonment of Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now her Democratic opponent for governor; there is simply no sign Hobbs broke the law. Lake has also called for the imprisonment of unspecified journalists she claims have told lies about the election and other subjects.\n\nThe Lake campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nArkansas: Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks at the America First Policy Institute Agenda Summit in Washington, DC, on July 26, 2022. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the former White House press secretary under Trump, has run a low-profile Arkansas gubernatorial campaign with only sporadic public comments to the media. But when the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper asked her this spring whether she believes the election was stolen from Trump, Sanders declined to affirm the election’s legitimacy – saying, “I don’t think we’ll ever know the depths of how much fraud existed.” She continued: “We know there is fraud in every election. How far and wide it went, I don’t think that will be something that will be ever determined.”\n\nSanders didn’t go nearly as far as her obscure primary opponent, who flatly declared the election stolen. Still, she chose to vaguely cast doubt on the outcome. (There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, certainly not enough to have changed the winner in any state.)\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCalifornia: Brian Dahle\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate state Sen. Brian Dahle discusses the upcoming race against Gov. Gavin Newsom during an interview in Sacramento, Calif., Thursday, June 9, 2022. Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nCalifornia Republican nominee Brian Dahle, a state senator who is challenging incumbent Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, refused to answer directly when The Los Angeles Times asked him in a May article whether Biden was legitimately elected, saying only that Biden is “our president.” In late April, the website CalMatters reported that Dahle “notably did not affirm the 2020 election results, even after CalMatters pushed his team to clarify Dahle’s position on Trump’s conspiracy theory about widespread voting fraud. In a TV interview a day later, he said: ‘Joe Biden is our president, no doubt.’”\n\nThe Dahle campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nColorado: Heidi Ganahl\n\nColorado Republican gubernatorial candidate Heidi Ganahl addresses the media after a watch party at the Wide Open Saloon on June 28, 2022 in Sedalia, Colorado. Marc Piscotty/Getty Images\n\nColorado Republican nominee Heidi Ganahl, a businesswoman and University of Colorado regent who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Jared Polis, refused on multiple occasions – including in late 2021 and early 2022 – to say whether Joe Biden won the election legitimately. In November 2021, Ganahl praised a group of election conspiracy theorists that has knocked on Colorado doors looking for evidence of fraud, saying the group was “doing great things,” the website Colorado Newsline reported.\n\nIn April 2022, the Colorado Sun reported that when Ganahl was pressed on a local radio show about whether she believes the election was “stolen,” she refused to answer directly and said, “I think there’s a lot of questions about what happened in the election.”\n\nThe Colorado Sun reported that Ganahl said in mid-June that “I don’t believe there was enough fraud that would have flipped the election.” But she also said “there are a lot of procedural things that were weird about this election,” criticizing states’ pre-election changes to their elections policies and Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s hundreds of millions in donations to local elections offices around the country. (Those donations helped cash-strapped offices deal with the demands of the Covid-19 pandemic but have been criticized by Republicans, sometimes conspiratorially, as inappropriate private influence.)\n\nIn July, Ganahl chose a running mate, Navy veteran and businessman Danny Moore, who falsely claimed on Facebook in January 2021 that Biden was “elected by the Democrat steal” and posted other baseless conspiratorial claims about the election. Because of these comments, Moore was removed in 2021 as chair of Colorado’s redistricting commission.\n\nAfter he was removed as chair, he told The Gazette newspaper of Colorado Springs that he isn’t a conspiracy theorist and doesn’t believe Trump got more votes than Biden. He said, “Joe Biden is the duly elected president. Joe Biden is the commander-in-chief.”\n\nThe Ganahl campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFlorida: Ron DeSantis\n\nU.S. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pauses as he speaks on stage at the Turning Point USA's (TPUSA) Student Action Summit (SAS) in Tampa, Florida, U.S., July 22, 2022. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nAppearing on Fox News two days after the 2020 election, incumbent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hinted at the notion that Republican legislators in key swing states could potentially override the presidential choices of state voters. DeSantis was one of the first prominent Republicans to publicly float this idea.\n\nDeSantis said, “Especially if you’re in those states that have Republican legislatures, like Pennsylvania and Michigan and all these places: call your state representatives and your state senators. Call Under Article II of the Constitution, presidential electors are done by the legislatures, and the schemes they create and the framework. And if there’s departure from that, if they’re not following law, if they’re ignoring the law, then they can provide remedies as well. So I would exhaust every option to make sure we have a fair count.”\n\nDeSantis continued into early December 2020 to say he was encouraging Trump to “fight on,” according to a Politico report at the time. When DeSantis was asked in mid-December 2020, after the Electoral College ratified Biden’s victory, if he accepted the Biden win, he responded, according to Politico: “It’s not for me to do. But here’s what I would say: Obviously we did our thing in Florida. The College voted. What’s going to happen is going to happen.”\n\nOn multiple occasions since then, DeSantis has refused to respond directly when asked if he thinks Biden was legitimately elected or if the election was rigged. Instead, he has generally pivoted to praise of how the election was handled in Florida, which Trump won, and to other comments.\n\nDeSantis’s office did not respond to a July request from CNN to explain where he stands on the legitimacy of Biden’s win.\n\nIdaho: Brad Little\n\nIdaho Gov. Brad Little laughs while talking with media after declaring victory in the gubernatorial primary during the Republican Party's primary election celebration Tuesday, May 17, 2022, at the Hilton Garden Inn hotel in Boise, Idaho. Kyle Green/AP\n\nIncumbent Idaho Gov. Brad Little endorsed the Texas lawsuit in December 2020 that attempted to get the Supreme Court to toss out the election results in four states won by Biden.\n\nLittle’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIllinois: Darren Bailey\n\nRepublican gubernatorial nominee Darren Bailey celebrates with supporters on primary election night on June 28, 2022, at Thelma Keller Convention Center in Effingham, Illinois. Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nIllinois State Sen. Darren Bailey, the Republican nominee who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. J.B. Pritzker, signed a letter that asked an Illinois member of Congress to object, on January 6, 2021, to the certification of Biden’s victory; the letter said, “Certifying this election is tantamount to legitimizing fraud.” (The letter was previously reported by the Effingham Daily News.)\n\nBailey vaguely promoted the false suggestion that there was voter fraud sufficiently widespread to have changed the outcome. On November 12, 2020, five days after television networks unofficially called the race for Biden, Bailey wrote on Twitter: “TRUMP…..4 more years! It’s coming……#voterfraudistreason.” In a Facebook video on December 3, 2020, he said it is “appalling” that other Illinois Republicans were calling on Trump to “give up” the fight and baselessly hinted that “illegal voting” had led to Republican defeats in races in the Chicago area.\n\nThe Bailey campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIowa: Kim Reynolds\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds speaks during the Ember Recovery Campus groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022, in Cambridge. Meg McLaughlin/The Register/USA Today Network\n\nIncumbent Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in December 2020 that she wanted Iowa to join the Texas lawsuit that tried to overturn Biden’s victories in four states, and she lamented that the state wasn’t given an opportunity to sign on because Iowa has a Democratic attorney general. She blocked an effort by that attorney general, Tom Miller, to formally submit his opposition to the lawsuit.\n\nDays after Biden’s January 2021 inauguration, Reynolds said on WHO 13 News of Des Moines, “I think he is legitimately elected.” But she continued to baselessly suggest there were unanswered questions “about the integrity of the election process.”\n\nReynolds’ office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKansas: Derek Schmidt\n\nIn this photo from Monday, Dec. 6, 2021, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt answers questions during an interview in his office in Topeka, Kan. Schmidt, a Republican running for governor, has issued a legal opinion saying an anti-abortion measure up for a statewide vote would not hinder medical care for women facing life-threatening pregnancies. John Hanna/AP\n\nKansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, the Republican gubernatorial nominee who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Laura Kelly, signed on to a legal brief in support of the Texas lawsuit that sought to overturn the election results in four states. Schmidt said in a statement in December 2020: “Texas asserts it can prove four states violated the U.S. Constitution in an election that affects all Americans, so Texas should be heard.”\n\nAfter the Supreme Court dismissed the Texas lawsuit later in December 2020, Schmidt issued a statement saying “the Court’s decision means it is time to put this election behind us.”\n\nThe Schmidt campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaine: Paul LePage\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Paul LePage speaks at the Republican state convention April 30, 2022, in Augusta, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nMaine Republican nominee and former governor Paul LePage, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Janet Mills, falsely claimed in a local radio appearance the week after the 2020 election: “This is clearly a stolen election.” He proceeded to make baseless claims about voter fraud and baselessly declare that Democrats don’t want fair elections. (His comments were previously reported by Beacon, a Maine website.)\n\nLePage has not limited such claims to the 2020 election. This April, he claimed that out-of-state voters bused into Maine to vote in a 2009 referendum on same-sex marriage, though there is no evidence for that either. And in 2018, upon certifying a Democrat’s victory in the first congressional election in US history ranked-choice voting, LePage wrote the words “stolen election” next to his signature.\n\nAsked for comment, the LePage campaign responded by asking CNN to cite the source for his claim that 2020 was a “stolen election.” When provided a link, the campaign did not respond again.\n\nMaryland: Dan Cox\n\nDan Cox, a candidate for the Maryland Republican gubernatorial nomination, speaks to reporters at his campaign party on primary night, Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Emmitsburg, Md. Kenneth K. Lam/The Baltimore Sun/AP\n\nMaryland state representative Dan Cox, the Republican nominee in the race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, has been a particularly aggressive denier of the 2020 results.\n\nCox co-organized buses to Trump’s January 6, 2021, rally in Washington, writing on Twitter that he was doing so to “#StoptheSteal” (a “steal” that didn’t occur). During the insurrection at the US Capitol that day, as the mob raged against the vice president who had no power to thwart the certification of Biden’s win, Cox tweeted: “Pence is a traitor.” The month prior, Cox had called on Trump to seize voting machines.\n\nIn a speech in late 2021, which was previously reported by The New York Times, Cox said that Trump was “the only president that I recognize right now” and falsely said Biden wasn’t elected but “installed, in my opinion.” In a post on Facebook this June, Cox referred to the 2020 election as a “GREAT HEIST.”\n\nThe Cox campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMassachusetts: Geoff Diehl\n\nMassachusetts Republican gubernatorial candidate Geoff Diehl speaks to supporters at his primary night victory party, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2022, in Weymouth, Mass. Josh Reynolds/AP\n\nMassachusetts Republican nominee Geoff Diehl initially rejected false claims about the 2020 election, saying days after he launched his campaign in July 2021 that “I don’t think it was a stolen election” and that Republicans need to “stop crying over spilled milk.”\n\nBut Diehl soon began shifting. By the time he won the primary in September 2022, he was explicitly saying that the election was stolen.\n\nAsked in an interview late in July 2021 whether he thought the election was stolen, Diehl said, “I don’t know. I don’t think you or anybody knows at this point.” The next month, Diehl called for a “forensic audit” in Massachusetts to search for “possible irregularities.” In October 2021, Diehl issued a statement falsely saying, “Sadly, it has become clear as the audit results from Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania have come to light, that the 2020 election was rigged.” The next day, Trump announced he was endorsing Diehl.\n\nIn August 2022, Diehl said in radio comments that were noted by the Democratic Governors Association: “The fact of the matter is: I was wrong initially. It definitely was an election that was stolen from Trump. And it was rigged in a way that should never happen again.”\n\nDiehl, a former state representative, is running against Democrat Maura Healey, the state attorney general, for the post being vacated by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. A Diehl campaign spokesperson said Diehl had no comment for this article.\n\nMichigan: Tudor Dixon\n\nRepublican candidate for Michigan governor Tudor Dixon appears at a debate in Grand Rapids, Mich., Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Michael Buck/WOOD TV8/AP\n\nMichigan Republican nominee Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator and anchor who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, falsely claimed at Republican primary debates that Trump was the legitimate 2020 winner in Michigan, where Biden actually defeated Trump by more than 154,000 votes, and that there was fraud sufficiently widespread to have swung the election to Biden.\n\nIn a reply Dixon tweeted to Trump in November 2020, she falsely wrote, “Steal an election then hide behind calls for unity and leftists lap it up.”\n\nDixon has sometimes taken a somewhat softer line, complaining about the election without calling it stolen. MLive.com reported that she said at one point in July that there was enough fraud “that we have to be very concerned,” adding, “I don’t think we can see enough of the evidence because we weren’t able to look back and some of that is destroyed now.” (It isn’t clear what she was talking about.) In a Fox News interview in late July, Dixon dodged when asked if she thought the election was stolen, saying instead, “Well, it’s certainly a concern to a lot of folks here in Michigan because of the way the election was handled by our secretary of state.”\n\nThe Dixon campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinnesota: Scott Jensen\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen announces a crime-fighting plan June 9, 2022, during a news conference outside the State Capitol in St. Paul. Steve Karnowski/AP\n\nAt a Minnesota Republican primary debate in December, eventual nominee Scott Jensen would not offer a firm answer when asked if he thinks Biden won a “constitutional majority” in the Electoral College. Instead, he responded, “I can’t know what I don’t know, and I think that we have to take that attitude towards 2020.”\n\nJensen, a physician and former state senator, went on to uncritically report that someone on the ground in Arizona’s Maricopa County, where Republicans conducted a partisan sham “audit,” had told him that thousands more mail-in ballots were returned than were sent out to voters; that claim is based on a misunderstanding of the county’s records. He then added, “I don’t think there’s any question that we’ve had enough shenanigans that we should want to do something about our election integrity. Which states crossed the line, which states hit a certain threshold, I can’t know that.”\n\nJensen baselessly suggested at a Republican event in April that Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, should be imprisoned. And Axios reported that as Jensen campaigned across Minnesota in the summer of 2021, he complimented Mike Lindell, the pillow businessman who has propagated wildly inaccurate conspiracy theories about the election, for working to “get rid” of voting machines. (Jensen told Axios he has never talked about Lindell’s specific theories about 2020 election and “wouldn’t know what he’s saying.”)\n\nThe Jensen campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNevada: Joe Lombardo\n\nJoe Lombardo, Clark County sheriff and a candidate for the Republican nomination for Nevada governor, stands on stage during a primary-night party, June 14, 2022, in Las Vegas. John Locher/AP\n\nNevada Republican nominee Joe Lombardo, the Clark County sheriff who is challenging incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, has not done the same kind of explicit election denial as some of the others on this list. Lombardo has said the election was not stolen and that Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nHowever, Lombardo has also fomented doubts about the election.\n\nIn 2021, Lombardo told the Reno Gazette Journal that he didn’t have the information necessary to say if the 2020 results were accurate, and he added that “we had an environment where it was easy to commit fraud.” (There is no evidence of any widespread fraud in Nevada in 2020.) This March, KRNV News 4 of Reno reported that Lombardo said he couldn’t say whether Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske was wrong to say there was no widespread voter fraud in 2020, since there hadn’t been a comprehensive audit.\n\nIn an email to CNN in July, Lombardo campaign spokesperson Elizabeth Ray said in an email that “Joe Lombardo has been clear … he has not been presented with evidence to show that any fraud would have changed the outcome of the 2020 election.” She added that, “however,” Sisolak and his allies “have passed laws that make it easier for bad actors from any party to commit fraud.”\n\nSisolak campaign spokesperson Reeves Oyster responded in an email: “Nevada has one of the strongest election systems in the country thanks to Governor Sisolak, who passed common sense legislation to ensure every eligible Nevadan can safely and easily cast their ballot. Joe Lombardo – on the other hand – has instilled doubt in our elections and cozied up to election deniers to appeal to his base while trying to ignore the Big Lie and its deadly ramifications for law enforcement officers. Lombardo’s willingness to take both sides of the Big Lie demonstrates he’s just another craven politician who will do or say anything to win.”\n\nNew York: Lee Zeldin\n\nLee Zeldin appears during New York's Republican gubernatorial debate at the studios of Spectrum News NY1 on June 20, 2022, in New York. Brittainy Newman/Newsday/AP\n\nNew York Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee who is challenging incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, voted against the certification of Biden’s victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania. In his speech that day, January 6, 2021, he claimed that he was objecting because “rogue” state officials had made “unlawful and unconstitutional” changes to elections policies.\n\nThe Zeldin campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPennsylvania: Doug Mastriano\n\nRepublican Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano speaks during the Manufacturer & Business Association's Legislative Luncheon in Erie, Pa. on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022. Greg Wohlford/Erie Times-News/AP\n\nPennsylvania State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who is running against Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro, has made an extensive effort to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn late 2020, on social media and in interviews, Mastriano made numerous false claims about supposed election fraud. (His comments were previously listed by WHYY radio.) Behind the scenes, Mastriano sent false claims about supposed fraud to the Justice Department. He also organized a November 2020 hearing in Pennsylvania in which Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani made false election claims.\n\nMastriano’s campaign chartered buses to the Trump rally in Washington on January 6, 2021. Mastriano himself was pictured on Capitol grounds during the riot at the Capitol that day. (The FBI subsequently questioned him, according to a source familiar with the interview; Mastriano has not been charged with anything.) Later in 2021, Mastriano spearheaded an effort to begin a so-called “forensic investigation” of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania.\n\nPennsylvania’s gubernatorial race is especially important for elections because its governor appoints the secretary of state, the top state elections official.\n\nThe Mastriano campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSouth Dakota: Kristi Noem\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem speaks on Feb. 25, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. Noem was initially eager to jump right into lawmaking when the U.S. Supreme Court indicated this year it was poised to allow states to ban abortions. John Raoux/AP\n\nTwo days after Election Day in 2020, incumbent South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.\n\nThen, in an ABC interview that aired five days after the election, Noem asserted that “dead people voted in Pennsylvania” (the number of such cases turned out to be tiny, and at least three involved registered Republicans) and referred to Michigan “computer glitches that changed Republican votes to Democrat votes” (in reality, a single, conservative county’s human error in reporting unofficial results had been quickly corrected). On Twitter, Noem added a reference to unspecified “illegal activity” in Nevada and declared that there were “so many serious election integrity concerns.”\n\nNoem attended Biden’s inauguration in January 2021 and congratulated him on the occasion. But she declined the following week to agree that the election was free and fair, the South Dakota Standard reported – acknowledging to reporters that “we now have President Biden” but also saying “I think there’s lot of people who have doubts” about whether the election was fair and transparent.\n\nThe Noem campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTexas: Greg Abbott\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott speaks before signing Senate Bill 1, also known as the election integrity bill, into law in Tyler, Texas, on Sept. 7, 2021. LM Otero/AP\n\nIncumbent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott spoke positively about the lawsuit that sought to overturn the results in four states (which was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton) – telling a Spectrum News 1 television reporter in December 2020 that the lawsuit “tries to accelerate the process, providing certainty and clarity about the entire election process. The United States of America needs that.”\n\nAbbott congratulated Biden on his inauguration in January 2021. In the fall of 2021, after pressure from Trump, he supported a state audit of the 2020 election in four counties in Texas, a state Trump won.\n\nThe Abbott campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWisconsin: Tim Michels\n\nWisconsin Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels speaks as he appears with former President Donald Trump at a rally in Waukesha, Wis., on Aug. 5, 2022. Morry Gash/AP\n\nWhen Tim Michels, the Republican nominee in Wisconsin who is challenging incumbent Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, was asked by a conservative radio host during the Republican primary in May whether he believes the 2020 election was stolen, Michels said, “Maybe.” According to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Michels added that “certainly, there was a lot of bad stuff that happened” and that there were “certainly illegal ballots.”\n\nThe Journal Sentinel reported that Michels, a businessman, baselessly said at a campaign event in May: “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.” At a campaign event in July, The Washington Post reported, Michels said: “My very first priority is election integrity. Everywhere I go on the campaign trail, people, the media, everybody says, ‘Tim, Tim, was the election fixed? Was the election rigged?’ I have a lot of questions, as everybody else has questions.”\n\nInn a brief interview with the Post and in other forums, Michels would not directly say whether he would, as governor, endorse an effort by other Republicans to decertify Biden’s 2020 victory in Wisconsin – again, an impossibility. He said at a Republican town hall in early August: “I will look at all the evidence and everything will be on the table and I will make the right decision.”\n\nMichels told the Journal Sentinel in June that it was too hypothetical to say at that point whether he would certify the 2024 results in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Michels campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated to add Alaska Gov.

The statues of Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey – three of numerous Black women Dr. J. Marion Sims operated on while in Montgomery – were unveiled Friday, al.com reported. Entitled “Mothers of Gynecology,” the three statues stand almost 15 feet high and were welded from common metal items donated for the project, including tools, bicycle parts, and surgical and gynecological instruments, according to the news site. “The endeavor is to change the narrative as it relates to the history and how it’s portrayed regarding Sims and the women that were used as experiments,” said Michelle Browder, the artist who created the monument. “They’re not mentioned in any of the iconography or the information, the markers.” Sims is held up as a pioneer in the field of gynecology, credited with developing new medical devices and a surgical technique to treat a complication of childbirth. But he also conducted experimental surgery without anesthesia on enslaved African-American women between 1845 and 1849. Anesthesia was still new at the time – the first public demonstration, using ether was in Boston in 1846. A statue of Sims still stands at the State House in Montgomery.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents of Alaska’s largest city often contend with bears and moose, but state officials are warning of another wild animal that has been causing problems: river otters. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said river otters have attacked people and pets in some of the city’s most popular outdoor areas, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Officials are asking people to be extra careful when they are around rivers, creeks and lakes along the city’s greenbelt. Earlier this month, a 9-year-old boy was taken to an emergency room for a rabies shot after being bitten several times near a duck pond. River otter attacks do happen, but are not considered commonplace, Fish and Game said. It’s not known if the attacks came from the same group of otters, which can range over large swaths of land. “Because of the risk to public safety, efforts will be made to locate this group of river otters and remove them,” Fish and Game said. “Care will be taken to only remove the animals exhibiting these unusual behaviors.”\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: A man who refused to wear a mask and was asked to leave during a performance at Arizona State University’s Gammage Auditorium has been arrested after he allegedly assaulted two staff members, according to campus police. Police said the man was asked to leave the venue during a performance of “Hamilton.” Witnesses said those who were attending Saturday’s show began cheering when the man was removed. Campus police said the man was being held on suspicion of assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct. Police said there were no reported injuries.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Democrat running for attorney general in Arkansas, where health officials have struggled with resistance to the coronavirus vaccine, on Monday vowed if elected to take social media companies to court for spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Jesse Gibson focused on COVID-19 misinformation in his first 30-second ad, which he said began airing online and on cable stations over the weekend. “Big corporations and big tech are profiting off the very spread of misinformation that puts Arkansas families and communities at risk, hurts our small businesses, and costs our economy,” Gibson said in the ad. Gibson said he was concerned about misinformation about the vaccine’s effectiveness as well as ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that health officials have warned against using as a COVID-19 treatment. He said he believed the social media companies could be targeted under the state’s deceptive trade practices and false advertising laws. Gibson’s proposal follows concerns raised by health officials about the spread of false information about the virus and vaccines. U.S. Surgeon General General Vivek Murthy earlier this year declared misinformation about vaccines a threat to public health.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Thousands of families sickened and forced from their Los Angeles homes after the nation’s largest-known natural gas leak have reached a settlement of up to $1.8 billion with a utility, attorneys said Monday. The settlement with Southern California Gas Co. and its parent company, Sempra Energy, will compensate 35,000 plaintiffs from the 2015 blowout that took nearly four months to control. The Aliso Canyon blowout led to the largest-known release of methane in U.S. history and was blamed for sickening thousands of residents who moved out of homes near the San Fernando Valley to escape a sulfurous stench and maladies including headaches, nausea and nose bleeds. The plaintiffs alleged personal injury for their illnesses and property damage to their homes. SoCalGas spent more than $1 billion on the blowout – with most going to temporarily relocate 8,000 families. The utility has faced more than 385 lawsuits on behalf of 48,000 people.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Kechter Road, which crosses Interstate 25 south of Harmony Road and connects Larimer County Road 5 to the west frontage road and into Fort Collins, will be fully closed starting Friday. The closure is part of the North I-25 Express Lanes project. Reopening is expected in May. Initially, the road was expected to close in September and reopen in April. Local traffic will be able to access Island Lake Marine & Sports on the west and Colorado Youth Outdoors on the east. Detours will be in place during the closure. Work includes the addition of a roundabout on the west side of I-25 at the intersection of Kechter Road and the west frontage road. In addition, the Kechter Bridge will be lengthened to accommodate the additional toll lanes below it for each direction of I-25. Kechter Road will remain as a single lane in both directions and include sidewalks, pedestrian crossings and bike lanes in both directions across the new bridge, which also will have its barriers on both sides heightened for safety purposes. I-25 will be raised in this area, and culverts will be added under the interstate to prevent flooding during a 100-year event. Upgrading this bridge was not in the original North I-25 Express Lanes project that started in 2018 but it was added last year when an additional $250 million was secured. That funding also allowed CDOT to completely reconfigure the U.S. Highway 34 and I-25 interchange.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A retired judge who also has served as a prosecutor and public defender was picked Monday to become Connecticut’s first inspector general, a position created to investigate any use of deadly force by police. Robert Devlin, 71, was chosen from among four finalists after interviews before the Connecticut Criminal Justice Commission. The commission voted 5-0 to appoint Devlin to the $180,000-a year position. Devlin told the commission that because of his age and experience, he would not be using the job as a steppingstone and plans to give everyone involved in each investigation “a fair shake.” “There are people in our society who think the police can do no wrong and there are people in our society who think the police can do no right,” Devlin told the commission. “It’s in that space in between that the inspector general has to work, and let the results speak for themselves.” Devlin, who was appointed as a Superior Court judge in 1992, served as the state’s chief administrative judge for that court from 2010 to 2017. He is the chairman of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark:ChristianaCare has fired 150 employees for not complying with its COVID-19 vaccine requirement, the health system announced Monday. Dr. Janice Nevin, CEO of ChristianaCare, wrote in a blog post for the hospital’s website that the 150 people equated to roughly 90 full-time positions. Many of the terminated workers were “part-time or casual employees,” according to a hospital spokeswoman. Of the 90 full-time equivalents, 48 were jobs involving patient care and less than a dozen related to nursing. ChristianaCare, which is the largest private employer in Delaware, employs more than 14,000 people. In July, it announced that all employees would be required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or be fired if they did not meet the requirements for an exemption. About 200 employees were given religious or medical accommodations, Nevin said. Those people will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing in addition to wearing a mask at work.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:An entire middle school at the Leckie Education Campus is in quarantine, WUSA-TV reported. Leckie, located on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SW in Ward 8, is a school that holds classes from kindergarten through eighth grade. The elementary classes are in the main building, but the middle school students attend classes in trailers behind the school. D.C. Public Schools reported an individual, who was last in the building on Sept. 16, tested positive for the coronavirus. A DCPS spokesperson said contact tracers deemed all 95 students in grades six through eight as close contacts of the individual. After students were sent home, a second person tested positive, so the quarantine was extended until Friday. DCPS said the students are home learning virtually.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: City of Miami commissioners held a special meeting in which they attacked the chief of police less than six months into his post, and voted to further investigate him and his appointment. Police chief Art Acevedo had been criticized after firing two high-level police officials and relieving of duty a sergeant-at-arms. Acevedo also angered Cuban exiles earlier this month when reports emerged of remarks made by him saying the “Cuban mafia” ran Miami. The Cuban-born chief apologized for the comments made to officers and said he didn’t know that was a term former Cuban leader Fidel Castro used to refer to exiles, arguing he was raised in California. Three of the five city commissioners are Cuban-American. On Friday, Acevedo sent an accusatory eight-page memo to the mayor and city manager saying those commissioners were hampering his efforts to reform the police department by eliminating positions and interfering with internal affairs investigations. Commissioners on Monday said these allegations would also be investigated by the committee they were forming. Acevedo, 57, came to Miami after serving more than four years as police chief in Houston, where he gained national prominence by calling for gun control, marching with protesters after George Floyd’s death and criticizing former President Donald Trump.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A herd of goats brought in to clear weeds got loose Monday, briefly becoming a thorn in the side of Atlanta’s tony Buckhead neighborhood. Atlanta police responded after a driver called to report the goats were wandering in the road, news outlets reported. They had been brought in to eat weeds at a nearby Kroger supermarket but got free, according to police. Television news footage showed them grazing outside a furniture store along a busy thoroughfare. They were caught and removed. Police said no one was injured.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials said 23 Native Hawaiians died from COVID-19 last week, accounting for 20% of all fatalities among Hawaii’s Indigenous people since the start of the pandemic 18 months ago. Native Hawaiians made up 40% of all deaths in the state during the seven days through Friday, KITV reported. Hawaiians are one-fifth of the state’s population. “We’ve also seen a number of really, really tragic stories move very quickly throughout our community,” said Nā’ālehu Anthony, the director of COVID Pau, a collaborative of businesses and nonprofit organizations delivering public health messages during the pandemic. “And, you know, one death is too much. One person dying is too much when it’s preventable when you have the vaccine.” COVID-19 vaccination rates among Native Hawaiians have lagged in comparison to the rest of the state. To counter this, Anthony has started a series of public service announcements on the importance of inoculating Native Hawaiians. The advertisements also focus on the importance of testing, mask wearing and social distancing. Some of the ads that have resonated refer to past diseases that wiped out much of Hawaii’s native population in the 1800s.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Cadaver dogs have found what are probably seven graves of mid-1880s migrants who died in south-central Idaho on the California Trail while crossing what is now the City of Rocks National Reserve. Experts with the Oregon-California Historic Trails and City of Rocks National Reserve identified two possible graves. The Post Register reported in a story last week that the cadaver dogs earlier this month confirmed the two sites as containing human remains and then found five more possible burial sites. “It wasn’t a surprise,” said Tara McClure-Cannon, assistant park manager at City of Rocks. “We had suspected some of these areas in the past based on what they looked like. The dogs were partly confirming our suspicions.” McClure-Cannon said the park has several options on how to handle the grave sites. It could bring in ground-penetrating radar to confirm they are graves containing bodies. In rare cases, potential graves are excavated. The locations of the potential grave sites will be marked with a GPS location, but not made public so they won’t be disturbed. About 200,000 migrants passed through the national reserve mainly heading to California on the California Trail that splits off of the nearby Oregon Trail, experts have said, adding that there are probably thousands of migrants buried along the California and Oregon trails.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State officials are celebrating attendance at this year’s Illinois State Fair after it was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state Department of Agriculture reported Tuesday that the Springfield-based festival in August attracted 472,390. Since 2014, when the agency started formally tracking attendance, that’s second only to the 508,900 who attended in 2019. Given the the turnstile count in 2019, State Fair Manager Kevin Gordon said “the bar was set pretty high” for attendance after a year’s layoff. “Being able to overcome the challenges brought on by the pandemic and safely bring back so many families to the fairgrounds is a great accomplishment,” Gordon said. Final numbers are not yet available, but officials are estimating revenue at $5 million, the ninth-highest in the past two decades. The 2022 Illinois State Fair is scheduled for Aug. 11-21.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: U.S. Steel temporarily shuttered operations at a northwest Indiana plant Monday after it leaked an orange substance into a Lake Michigan tributary, prompting the closure of a water treatment facility and several nearby beaches. The U.S. Steel Midwest plant in Portage was idled as a precaution “after experiencing an upset condition with the finishing line wastewater treatment plant,” U.S. Steel spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski said in a statement. “The plant operations will remain down until the condition is stabilized. This upset is currently believed to be the cause of the discolored water seen coming from one of our outfalls,” she said. Initial indications “show higher than normal suspended solids in the water” Malkowski said, adding that the the company is conducting additional sampling and working to determine the cause of the problem at the wastewater treatment facility. She did not describe the contents of the leaked substance. Portage Mayor Sue Lynch said she began receiving calls about 5:50 p.m. Sunday concerning an unknown substance pouring from a U.S. Steel Midwest plant outfall into the Burns Waterway that feeds into Lake Michigan. The plant is about 30 miles east of Chicago. Lynch told The (Northwest Indiana) Times she wasn’t sure what the substance could be, but that an employee from the Portage Marina had collected a sample for analysis. An Indiana Department of Environmental Management spokesman said Monday that the agency was investigating and would provide an update after it receives and analyzes sampling test results.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge on Monday extended a restraining order for 14 days that prohibits Iowa officials from enforcing a law that bans school districts from enacting mask mandates. The order issued by Judge Robert Pratt extends his initial order from Sept. 13 until Oct. 11, which means school districts might impose mask mandates and the state cannot stop them. Pratt concluded that enforcement of the law continues to pose a threat to the health of children. Documents filed in the case Monday claim that nearly a quarter of Iowa public school students are in districts that have experienced significant COVID-19 outbreaks this year. The information indicates 11 school districts, including Waterloo, Sioux City and Muscatine, reported more positive cases in the first month of the school year than during the entire previous year. The data was included in court documents made public Monday by attorneys for 11 parents and the disability rights group The Arc of Iowa who are suing the state. The documents said 16 other school districts, including Marshalltown, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, have already recorded coronavirus cases equivalent to 50% of the tally for the last school year. The 27 school districts represent 24.5% of all Iowa public school students.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The pastor of a Catholic parish in Topeka has been suspended from his public duties after being accused of sexually abusing a minor, the archdiocese for northeast Kansas announced Monday. The Rev. John Pilcher of Mater Dei parish denied the allegation and is fully cooperating, the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said. He will remain on leave until an investigation is complete and an independent review board has made a recommendation to Archbishop Joseph Naumann, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The archdiocese said that law enforcement was notified and announcement about the allegation made at all weekend Masses. The parish includes two churches, Assumption across the street north of the Statehouse and Holy Name in central Topeka. They once were in separate parishes that merged in 2006. The archdiocese said anyone with knowledge about the case regarding Pilcher or about any other misconduct should contact civil authorities first, then make a report to its confidential report line.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A Kentucky safety and personal protective equipment developer is manufacturing a new respirator to help front-line health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Demand for respirators skyrocketed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The machines provide clean, breathable air to workers treating patients with the virus. Cynthiana-based Bullard said the new respirator is designed to be more comfortable and make it easier for the workers to better communicate. The respirators were built with “all day use” in mind, to be worn around the shoulders instead of the waist, said Landon Borders, Bullard’s director of product development.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Deer hunters across Louisiana can qualify for a $1,000 drawing by having the head of a mature white-tailed buck tested for a slow but always fatal illness called chronic wasting disease. Taxidermists in the state can do the same for a chance in a $500 drawing – with permission from the hunter who harvested the buck, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release. Chronic wasting disease is always fatal in deer, elk or moose, but it can take 16 months to four years for the first symptoms to show up. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said scientists don’t know whether it can infect people, but the agency recommended against eating venison from infected animals. The disease has not yet been found in Louisiana. But all three neighboring states – Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi – are among at least 26 where it has been found. The department wants to test deer taken statewide during Louisiana’s 2021-22 hunting seasons. The tests are free until a region meets its testing quota, said Dr. James LaCour, the state veterinarian. Heads – with or without antlers and skull cap, but with at least 5 inches of neck – can be brought to regional department offices in Hammond, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Minden, Monroe and Pineville, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nFrenchboro: Regulators in Maine said they found no permit violations stemming from thousands of fish deaths at an aquaculture operation off the state’s coast. Cooke Aquaculture, a Canada-based fish farming giant, operates salmon farms that include ocean-based pens in Maine. The firm found thousands of fish deaths in August at sites it operates at Black Island and Black Island South. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said the company reported more than 100,000 fish deaths between the sites. The company also told the state that it removed and disposed of the fish and cleaned equipment at the sites. The Maine DEP said on Monday that it inspected the sites in late August. The agency said it did not “identify any permit violations or violations of the Clean Water Act in relation to the reported fish kill.” Maine DEP said its investigation into the fish deaths is closed.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Renovation of the Nicodemus Building, which is being turned into housing for students attending classes at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, is progressing, according to Patrick Grace, owner of Trademark Investments, which purchased the former house and motel for $1,000 through the city’s competitive negotiated sale program. The program helps put city-owned properties into the private sector for redevelopment. The city council approved the sale in November. “We’re excited now,” Grace said. “There’s a lot of preplanning at the beginning, where things don’t move quickly. Now we’re in that phase where we’re moving really quickly, and it’s exciting to see how the units are going to shape up.” Grace said he hopes the work will be finished by January. Construction is happening from top to bottom at the building, which has a basement under three stories. The largest apartment is in the basement. The smallest is on the top floor. Historic features, such as a stairway, fireplaces and ornate trim work, are being preserved throughout.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The guitar played by Johnny Ramone on all 15 Ramones albums and at nearly 2,000 live performances by the rock band sold at auction over the weekend for more than $900,000, the auctioneer said Monday. The 1965 Mosrite Ventures II electric guitar was bought by a collector in the U.S. who wished to remain anonymous, Boston-based RR Auction said in a statement. Ramone, whose real name was John Cummings, bought the guitar to replace his original blue Ventures II, which was stolen, according to RR Auction. It was played at every Ramones performance from November 1977 until his retirement in August 1996, RR said. He died in 2004. The guitar, along with other Ramones memorabilia, came from the collection of Daniel Rey, a musician and producer who was also a longtime Ramones collaborator. Some of the other items sold included Johnny Ramone’s Mark-2 signature guitar for almost $50,000, and Joey Ramone’s Shure microphones from the final Ramones concert for more than $13,000. The auction began Aug. 24 and concluded Saturday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Institute of Arts soon will be welcoming school field trips for the first time since the pandemic began in March 2020. Admission and bus transportation is free for all K-12 schools in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. The Institute of Arts is supported by a property tax in the counties. School groups can sign up starting Oct. 12. Before the pandemic, more than 90,000 students a year visited the art museum on field trips. “It is hard to imagine that it has been 19 months since we’ve last heard the sounds of students and teachers exploring the galleries,” said Jason Gillespie, director of education programs. Masks are required. Lunch or snack space cannot be provided.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state is on the verge of selling a refrigerated warehouse that it bought in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in case it was needed as backup morgue. When the administration of Gov. Tim Walz announced the purchase of the former Bix produce building in St. Paul, it expressed worries, based on the experiences of New York City, that the state’s mortuaries could be swamped with pandemic victims. The state paid nearly $5.48 million for the facility, which could have held 5,100 bodies, but never stored corpses there, just personal protective equipment. Now, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported, the St. Paul Port Authority board is preparing to vote Tuesday on whether to take the warehouse off the state’s hands for $5.65 million, the property’s current appraised value, giving the state a slight profit. The Port Authority’s goal, according to board documents, is to flip the building as quickly as possible, with a goal of selling it by Dec. 1. “The idea is to find a buyer who will bring jobs to the city of St. Paul,” Andrea Novak, a Port Authority marketing manager, told the newspaper. “There is no specific buyer in the wings. We will market this aggressively.” The Democratic governor had come under criticism for the buying the facility from Republicans who saw it as wasteful spending.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state intends to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that it come up with a plan detailing how it will work to prevent unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental illness. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves told the state it had 120 days to submit a plan to the U.S. Justice Department and a mental health expert. He ordered that the final plan, incorporating their feedback, be completed in 180 days. Attorneys for the state asked in court documents filed Monday if the deadline could be postponed because the state intends to appeal Reeves’ ruling. James Shelson, the state’s attorney, wrote that if the Department of Mental Health were required to complete its plan and other requirements of Reeves’ order in the allocated time frame, “Mississippi will suffer irreparable injuries from undue interference with its mental health system and a fundamental alteration of that system both in costs and structure.”\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The Missouri Department of Conservation plans to test hundreds of deer for COVID-19 this hunting season following a recent federal report. The U.S Department of Agriculture reported the results of a federal study testing white-tailed deer in Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. Samples showed at least 7% of the population having antibodies for the virus that causes COVID-19. The highest population showed a whopping 67% in Michigan. The USDA report showed that although deer were carrying the antibodies, none actually fell ill. There is no evidence of deer dying or humans contracting the coronavirus from eating venison. “We want to be proactive,” said Jasmine Batten, wildlife health program supervisor for the Missouri Department of Conservation. “We’re paying attention to other states, and this is the first step to see what’s going on in our state.” Batten emphasized that the testing plan is still in the preliminary stage, the Columbia Missourian reported. As of now, the plan is to test the deer that will be killed this hunting season. Deer hunting season has begun for archery, and begins Oct. 30 for youth hunters and Nov. 13 for adult hunters with firearms.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Three gray wolves from a large pack in Yellowstone National Park that’s popular among tourists have been killed by Montana hunters, park officials said Monday. The two female pups and a female yearling from the Junction Butte pack were killed outside the park’s northern boundary in the first week after wolf season opened earlier this month, park officials said. The deaths follow the recent end to longstanding restrictions on how many wolves can be killed in areas of Montana bordering the park. That came after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed laws intended to make it easier to kill wolves as a way to reduce their attacks on livestock and big game herds. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said the park is trying to convince Montana officials to reinstate wolf hunting and trapping quotas across the park to protect its wolves. Idaho, which borders Yellowstone to the west, also has lifted wolf hunting restrictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An Omaha woman has been charged with felony counts after dozens of dead animals were found in her home rendered uninhabitable by filth, waste and rotting animal carcasses. The Nebraska Humane Society said in a court affidavit that the discovery was made last month in the home of 47-year-old Jaime Kimbrough. In a seven-page affidavit, a Humane Society officer detailed visits to Kimbrough’s home over several days in August following a complaint about rabbit hording. Various officers described speaking with Kimbrough, whom they described as physically disabled and said she crawled out of the house on her belly and appeared to have feces smeared on her clothing and bare feet. She denied having any rabbits and falsely told officers that her two dogs had been vaccinated, according to the affidavit. On Aug. 19, a Humane Society team executed a search warrant at the home and found the carcasses of at least 43 dead rabbits – most of them in Kimbrough’s garage – and two bird skeletons in cages in a bedroom. Two dogs and eight rabbits were found alive but suffering from neglect. Two of the rabbits had to be euthanized. Kimbrough’s attorney, Kaz Long, questioned why the situation was being handled as a criminal rather than civil matter. “My client was doing her best with her limited ability,” Long said. “This is a woman who needs help.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Mayor Carolyn Goodman and the head of the Nevada state Republican party are pitching the idea of the city playing host to the GOP National Convention ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. Goodman on Monday issued a statement saying she told the Republican National Committee in response to an inquiry that Las Vegas would be the best place for the three-day event in the summer of 2024. State Republican party Chairman Michael McDonald followed with a statement of support, calling the convention “a huge opportunity for our city and state to bring business back to the convention capital of the world.” The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to an email asking how many cities were invited to bid to host the convention. Goodman, now in her third term as mayor, succeeded her husband, Oscar, after he served three terms in the nonpartisan office. She also is a member of the powerful regional tourism board, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The mayor said formal bids to host the convention are due to the Republican National Committee by Dec. 1.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The newest addition to the New Hampshire Fallen Firefighters Memorial marks the first time the state is recognizing a death caused by occupational cancer. Newington Fire Chief Darin Sabine died of cancer in 2019. His name was one of four added to the state’s memorial to fallen firefighters in Concord on Saturday. Sabine’s wife, Jennifer, told WMUR-TV that the honor was a step in the right direction. Also honored were Dover Chief James Smith, who died in 1925 while investigating a gas leak; Dover Lt. Earnest Leblanc, who died while fighting a fire in 1959; and Goffstown Cpt. Steve Tower, who died in 2020 during a training test. With the new additions, the memorial now includes 95 names.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeal: A Jersey Shore town with a long history of trying to discourage outsiders from using its beaches is about to get millions of dollars worth of new sand, paid for by federal and New Jersey taxpayers. U.S. Rep Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, said Monday the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will conduct beach replenishment in three towns in November, including Deal. The federal government is paying 65%, or $17 million, of the $26 million project. Beach access advocates said Deal has one of the worst records of any Jersey Shore town when it comes to requirements that the state’s beaches be open and accessible to all. And there is an explicit requirement that towns that accept publicly paid-for sand as part of beach replenishment comply with public beach access rules, including providing adequate public parking within a reasonable distance. Deal has tried numerous times to enact laws that would allow only residents of some streets closest to the beach to park there during the summer, and it is being sued by a coastal advocacy group fighting its sale to a neighboring homeowner of a street end used by surfers and others to get onto the beach. As recently as June, Deal, located just north of Asbury Park, tried to enact an ordinance that would limit parking on several streets nearest the beach to residents only, but then backed off. That is one of several times it has proposed such a law only to abandon the effort.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s struggle with violent crime and escalating homelessness took center stage Monday as the three candidates running for mayor in New Mexico’s largest city faced off during a forum sponsored by the New Mexico Black Voters Collaborative. Crime has been among the top issues for voters as the city deals with record homicides this year. Incumbent Tim Keller, a Democrat, has been facing heat for not being able to contain the problem during his tenure. Keller tried to defend his record during the forum, saying his administration is addressing the root causes – addiction and poverty – through community policing efforts, a new public safety office and other initiatives. He said the Albuquerque police force is adequately funded and that more money needs to be spent on social workers and support programs. He also took swipes at Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, saying that crime was his problem too. Gonzales, a Democrat, accused Keller of politicizing law enforcement and not supporting the city’s officers. He described the city at “a crossroads of total anarchy,” where people no longer feel safe and families are choosing to move away. Republican candidate Eddy Aragon, a radio station owner and talk show host, said the city is in crisis. “We need to do what we can to go ahead and turn this city around,” he said, pointing to growing economic insecurity, drug addiction and mental health issues.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The nation’s largest school district can immediately impose a vaccine mandate on its teachers and other workers, a federal appeals panel decided Monday, leading attorneys for teachers to say they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The city’s Department of Education said the mandate would now go into effect at the end of Friday, so that all teachers and staff would be vaccinated by Oct. 4, the following Monday. The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a brief order late in the day that lifted a block of the mandate that a single appeals judge had put in place on Friday. After an adverse ruling from a Brooklyn judge, a group of teachers had brought the case to the appeals court, which assigned a three-judge panel to hear oral arguments Wednesday. But the appeals panel issued its order Monday after written arguments were submitted by both sides. Attorney Mark Fonte, who brought the lawsuit on behalf of teachers and others, said in a statement that he and attorney Louis Gelormino were immediately petitioning the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Novant Health said Monday that more than 175 of its workers have been fired for failing to comply with its COVID-19 vaccination requirement. Last week, Novant Health announced 375 employees had been suspended and given five days to comply with the mandate. The deadline was Friday. Nearly 200 of those employees came into compliance, Spokesperson Megan Rivers said in an email Monday. Rivers didn’t provide specific numbers on how many out of the 375 were in compliance and how many lost their jobs. More than 99% of Novant Health’s 35,000-plus employees are now compliant with the vaccine mandate, including employees who have submitted an approved religious or medical vaccine exemption, according to a statement. The Winston-Salem-based system includes 15 hospitals, 800 clinics and hundreds of outpatient facilities.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: An explosion and fire has caused significant damage to a house in Minot, but no one has been injured, according to fire officials. Firefighters were dispatched to a home in southwest Minot about 1:30 a.m. Monday. Fire engulfed the rear of the house with flames spreading toward adjacent structures. Crews began search and rescue operations on all three floors of the house until they could account for all occupants. No one was injured. The cause of the explosion and fire is under investigation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The newly drawn legislative district maps in Ohio were contested for the third time Monday, when state and national civic groups filed suit alleging the Republican-controlled redistricting process violated voters’ rights. The newest lawsuit, filed in the Ohio Supreme Court by three advocacy organizations and six individual Ohioans, seeks to block the maps of Ohio House and Senate districts passed Sept. 16 along party lines by the GOP-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission and require the commission to draw new districts. The litigation follows in line with legal action taken by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee’s legal arm and the ACLU on behalf of the League of Women Voters, A. Philip Randolph Institute and individual voters, each alleging the maps violate Ohio’s constitution. In addition to Talley, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit include five individual voters, as well as the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Ohio, Ohio Organizing Collaborative and the Ohio Environmental Council. The plaintiffs are represented by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law and law firm Reed Smith. Republican Senate President Matt Huffman, who led the map-making effort, has defended the maps as fair and constitutionally compliant – criticizing Democrats and special interest groups for thwarting a bipartisan deal. John Fortney, a spokesman for Huffman, called the latest legal challenge an example of “another elitist D.C. think tank representing more far left groups attempts to lecture Ohioans about the liberal definition of fairness.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Goodholm Mansion, moved twice since it was constructed in 1901, was torn down over the weekend after sitting unoccupied for a dozen years in a field in eastern Oklahoma County. The mansion was one of the oldest surviving homes originally built in Oklahoma City and predated construction of the Harn home at the Harn Homestead and the Overholser Mansion in Heritage Hills. The owner, Christina Puckett, said her family tried for years to sell the home after her father, Richard Harris, bought it and moved it to Nicoma Park and died soon after. The home was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places and was historic for its architecture, age and original owner. The home marked the rise of Andrew Goodholm into the ranks of city fathers who shaped the prairie town into a city. Goodholm was born in Filipstad, Sweden, in 1861 and immigrated to Kansas in the 1880s. He moved to Oklahoma City in 1894 and opened Acme Milling Co., which quickly became the city’s largest flour mill. Construction on the home began in 1899 and was completed in 1901. The home was unique for central Oklahoma, featuring a Queen Anne Victorian styling topped with a round turret with a conical roof. The top floor included a ballroom. Around the outside a veranda, which included a “courting swing,” circled half the house.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State Treasurer Tobias Read on Monday launched his campaign for governor. The Beaverton Democrat said he would focus on Oregon’s children as governor, making Pre-K more accessible, extending the school year, expanding career and technical training and investing in clean energy to fight climate change. The Statesman Journal reports Read was elected as Oregon’s treasurer in 2016 and re-elected to a second term in November 2020. Before that, he represented Beaverton in the Oregon House of Representatives for a decade. Read joins an expanding Democratic primary field. Five candidates have officially filed to run for governor, not including House Speaker Tina Kotek of Portland, who has also announced her intention to run. The Democratic field is crowded in part because Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, is unable to run again because of term limits.Four Republicans are also officially running for the office. A Republican hasn’t served as governor of Oregon since Vic Atiyeh left in 1987.The deadline to file with the secretary of state is March 8.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: William Hite Jr., the superintendent of the Philadelphia School District, said he will be leaving the post next summer. Hite said in a video released to staff that “after much reflection” he had decided not to seek renewal of his contract when it expires in August 2022. He said leading the district of 120,000 students in more than 200 schools had been a “tremendous honor and privilege” and vowed to support the board in its search for a new superintendent. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Hite said in an email to staff Monday night that he wanted to share the news now to allow “a full and complete search process for the next leader of the district, but I want to assure you all that I’m not going anywhere before August 2022.” The next year, he said, would see several critical initiatives focusing on equity, facilities planning, and environmental improvements. Hite was hired in June 2012 to take over a district in financial trouble and the following year recommended closing 37 schools, 23 of which were shut. He presided over the end of the 17-year state takeover and his contract was renewed in 2015.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:A judge on Tuesday dismissed a legal challenge by firefighters to block a state requirement for health care workers to get a coronavirus vaccine by Oct. 1 or risk losing their licenses. The Rhode Island Association of Firefighters argued that the state Department of Health’s mandate violated state law that requires the negotiation of terms and conditions of employment, and violated the firefighters’ collective bargaining rights, The Providence Journal reported. They sought an injunction barring enforcement of the rule. The health care worker vaccine mandate applies to emergency medical technicians, and many firefighters are EMTs licensed through the health department. “In short, the court does not believe this regulation imposes a new working condition,” Judge Melissa Darigan wrote in her decision. An email seeking comment was left with the union.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dylann Roof has lost the next phase of his appeal, with a federal court turning down his request for a new hearing to challenge his death sentence and conviction in the 2015 slayings of nine members of a Black congregation. In an order issued Monday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that it was denying Roof’s request for a hearing before a full appellate court, as well as his petition that a court of substitute judges from other circuits be designated to consider his case. All of the judges from the 4th Circuit, which covers South Carolina, have recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case, thus adding an uncommon wrinkle to the flow his appeals process. One of their own, Judge Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney. Richardson led the case against Roof in 2017, when he became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. He was 21 at the time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux City:Sioux Area Metro continues to face a driver shortage affecting the city's bus service, officials said at a meeting of the Public Transit Advisory Board. All fixed routes have been moved to hourly service from the downtown bus depot since Aug. 16, except for Route 11, which continues half-hour service from the Southwest Transfer Facility. Night service remains unchanged, and Saturday service is operating through SAM On Demand. Robert Speeks, Sioux Area Metro's general manager, said they're at 32 fixed-route drivers, although three of them are out on medical leave. Another three drivers have been newly hired, bringing them to a total of 35. However, Speeks said, they will need between 36 and 38 drivers for full service, and although they have applicants, it takes time to train them and get them driving full shifts. Speeks said that when the service reduction began, they saw a slight drop in ridership that has slowly increased toward normal levels.\n\nTennessee\n\nJamestown: A nonprofit organization and two state agencies have expanded protection of conserved property in the Cumberland Plateau by more than 11,700 acres. The Conservation Fund, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture Division of Forestry and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency announced the expansion, completing an effort to conserve more than 14,700 acres in the plateau. The new property is adjacent to the state’s Skinner Mountain Wildlife Management Area and will remain privately owned, the parties said in a news release. The addition will expand recreational access at Skinner Mountain WMA, protect vulnerable wildlife habitat and support local timber jobs, the release said. The area contains gorges, cliffs and waterfalls near the East Fork Obey River and provides habitat for endangered and threatened species of mussels, migratory songbirds and plants, the release said. The expansion fully conserves more than 50 caves, including the state’s fifth longest. The caves provide winter habitat for Tennessee’s most endangered mammal, the Indiana bat, and six additional species of concern, the release said.\n\nTexas\n\nSmithville:A Union Pacific train with hazardous cargo derailed at Texas 95 and Martin Luther King Boulevard in Smithville at 5 a.m. Sunday, leading to road closures and the evacuation of 20 to 25 nearby homes. No injuries were reported and the city posted updates throughout the day on its Facebook page. The city said just before 2 p.m. that residents were allowed to return to their homes. The tanker cars were empty but some contained residual hydrochloric acid that leaked, according to the city. The Union Pacific HazMat team decontaminated the scene and air samples were taken of the evacuation zone to confirm that it was safe for people to return to their homes. Sgt. Matthew Henderson with the Smithville Police Department said that the leaking tank was patched and treated with a neutralizing chemical that was then vacuumed out of the tank and transported off site. The cause of the derailment has not yet been made public, Henderson said, but federal investigators, as well as investigators from Union Pacific, were on the scene Sunday.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Lawmakers are considering a crackdown on catalytic converter theft, in which criminals saw the emission control devices from cars and sell the precious metals found inside to a booming worldwide black market. State Rep. Ryan Wilcox, a Republican who represents House District 7, covering North Ogden, Pleasant View and a part of Ogden, is sponsoring a bill to create a statewide database of catalytic converter sales, the Standard-Examiner reported. “We want to force the (illegal) sales out of the legitimate areas, to lock down the legitimate ways to dispose of them,” Wilcox said. The usual proper channel is through metal recycling yards.” Candace Daly, a Utah recycling industry representative who testified last week at a hearing on the bill before the Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Interim Committee, said the going rate per ounce for rhodium this week was $9,950. Palladium is worth $1,967 per ounce, and platinum is $928, she said, listing three metals commonly found in catalytic converters. Thieves might try to sell stolen converters to recyclers and sometimes are successful because tracking and enforcement is lacking, hence the need for a database, said Chris Walden, a Utah Attorney General’s Office supervisory special agent.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: Middlebury College removed the name of former Vermont governor John Mead from the campus chapel on Monday because of his “instigating role” in eugenics policies of the early 1900s that “sought to isolate and prevent the procreation of so-called ‘delinquents, dependents, and defectives,’ ” the school announced. The move follows the Legislature’s apology last spring to all Vermonters and their families and descendants who were harmed by state-sanctioned eugenics policies and practices that led to sterilizations. Some Vermonters of mixed French Canadian and Native American heritage, as well as poor, rural white people, were placed on a state-sanctioned list of “mental defectives” and degenerates and sent to state institutions. Mead, a physician and industrialist who graduated from Middlebury in 1864, served as Vermont governor from 1910 to 1912, the school said. The college’s Mead Memorial Chapel was named after him and his wife when they gave $74,000 to the school in 1914 to create a new, prominent chapel on the highest point on campus, Middlebury President Laurie Patton and Trustees Chair George Lee said in email to the school community. Two years before that, Mead had strongly urged the legislature to adopt policies and create legislation premised on eugenics theory, they said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Some Democrats on a bipartisan redistricting commission said that new legislative districts will be fair only if they reflect the partisan success Democrats have had in the state for the past decade. The remarks came after Democratic and Republican map drawers for the first time submitted a joint map with proposed new boundaries for the 40-member state Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow 21-19 majority. The newly proposed map provides an even 20-20 split in terms of which party holds an advantage, using the vote in the 2016 presidential election as a guide. Although an even split sounds fair on the surface, Democrats on the commission said that would dilute Democratic influence, given that Democrats have won every statewide election since 2009. Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, said Democrats should hold an advantage in at least 22 districts, maybe more, to fairly respect the state’s Democratic tilt.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Landlords must soon provide six months’ notice of rent hikes and, in some cases, pay tenants who move following a large rent increase. The Seattle City Council approved two bills on Monday. They are the latest of new landlord-tenant regulations including bans on some evictions and the right to a lawyer for low-income tenants facing eviction, The Seattle Times reported. Councilmember Kshama Sawant sponsored the proposals, saying they will help “to mitigate the harm that is going to be experienced by renters because of skyrocketing rents.” Property owners argued the measures could push small-scale operators to sell their rentals. The council approved a bill requiring 180 days’ notice of rent increases with a 7-1 vote. Landlords are currently required to give 60 days’ notice for rent increases. Councilmember Alex Pedersen voted no, saying the bill should exempt landlords with a small number of properties. Councilmember Debora Juarez was absent.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Fall fire season gets underway this week in West Virginia, with limits set on outdoor burning through the end of the year. Starting Friday, burning vegetation and other naturally occurring material is limited to the hours of 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., the Division of Forestry said. A 10-foot safety area around the fire must be cleared to dirt level. Fires must be attended at all times, and open fires must be 50 feet away from structures, the division said. Violation of burning laws can result in a fine of up to $1,000. Commercial burning permits from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. are available from local Division of Forestry offices.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Senate Republicans confirmed four of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ Cabinet appointments Tuesday after letting them languish for months but took no action on a key pick that would give the governor control of wildlife and pollution policies. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Craig Thompson and Randy Romanski as transportation and agriculture secretaries; Missy Hughes as secretary of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.; and Dawn Crim as secretary of the Department of Safety and Professional Services. The Senate also confirmed about 30 other appointments to various boards, commissions and committees, including Daniel Carlton Jr. as administrator of the Wisconsin Ethics Commission and Joaquin Altoro as executive director of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Not on Tuesday’s docket was Sandra Naas, Evers’ choice to replace Natural Resources Board Chairman Fred Prehn. His term expired in May, prompting Evers to appoint Naas to fill his slot. The move would give Evers appointees majority control of the body that regulates hunting, pollution and other environmental policies. But Prehn, who was appointed by then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker, has refused to step down. He points to a 1964 state Supreme Court ruling that gubernatorial appointees don’t have to leave their posts until their replacements are confirmed.\n\nWyoming\n\nWilson: Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming’s lone House member, will be the featured speaker at a New Hampshire fundraising event celebrating the First Amendment. Cheney, a fierce critic of fellow Republican Donald Trump, will speak at the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications’ First Amendment Awards on Nov. 9 at St. Anselm College’s Institute of Politics in Manchester.Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was an ascendant Republican leader before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol but has become increasingly defined by her public opposition to Trump and his hold on the GOP. She is serving as vice chair of the nine-person committee investigating the riot.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/29"}]}

It turned out that Mario Van Peebles was the director for that episode so besides getting cast in the show, I also got to meet him, which was great.\"\n\nNalley, who hails from Elizabethtown, about 45 miles south of Louisville, was asked to the set of \"CSI\" after show producers in Los Angeles spotted his macabre, yet hilarious series of TikToks.\n\nFor the past year, the 42-year-old restaurant manager has campaigned for the role of an \"un-alive person\" on a \"movie or television show\" by creating daily posts at various locations around the Bluegrass State.\n\nAlthough the locations are always different, his postures seldom vary.\n\nMost often he's facedown, in snow, dirt, grass, or rocks on the bank of a river, someone's front lawn, or a local park.

Day 295 finds him resting in peace at the foot of a graffiti-covered wall at the Otter Creek Park Pavillion. He appears dead as a doornail in snow-covered grass in his post from Day 101.\n\n\"I don't like speaking on camera, but I can lie there and act like I am dead pretty easily,\" he laughed. \"Having done more than 300 of these posts, I have progressed and gotten better. At first, you could see me breathing, or the fake blood looked really bad. I have gotten rid of using the blood and gotten better at holding my breath.\"\n\nIt's the animals that sometimes trip him up. He often gets friends to help make the videos, which once included a few unruly goats and there are many videos that include his dogs.\n\n\"I have figured out that it's best to have some kind of movement in the videos so it doesn't look like a still photograph,\" he said. \"One of my dogs still seems curious about what I am up to.

The thing was the sidewalk was really, really hot.\"\n\nFor his television debut, Nalley spent two hours in makeup and then lay very still on a gurney for the three or four takes it took to get the scene just right.\n\n\"We had to redo one take because I had my phone in my pocket and forgot to turn it off,\" he said. \"Of course, it was a telemarketer calling. That was kind of embarrassing.\"\n\nAlthough Nalley doesn't plan on quitting his day job, he also doesn't plan to give up the ghost on this TikTok campaign to play \"un-alive\" parts in the future. He's actually received several offers to \"play dead\" including in a music video and there have been a few low-budget movies that have also reached out.\n\nFor now, Nalley is weighing his options while continuing to produce TikTok videos, most of which promote his upcoming appearance on CSI: Vegas, which will air Nov. 3 at 10 EDT/PDT on CBS.\n\n\"I originally got this idea after seeing a woman on TikTok posting about hot sauce and then she got offers from a bunch of hot sauce companies,\" Nalley said.\" I thought if I was creative enough playing an un-alive person, I could get the attention of a television show or a movie production company, and how about that, it worked.\"\n\nYou can check out Nalley's Tik Tok campaign and follow his burgeoning career at tiktok.com/t/ZTR5wXQcV/.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

With annual fees of more than £45,000, Winchester College has “produced no fewer than six chancellors of the Exchequer”, said Study International. And of Britain’s 57 prime ministers, 20 – including Boris Johnson – were educated at Winchester’s rival, Eton, according to the BBC.\n\n‘Private school problem’\n\n“Posh boys reign supreme in a society where two years ago, eight elite schools (six private and two state) sent more pupils to Oxford and Cambridge than almost 3,000 other UK state schools,” said Fiona Millar in The New European in March.\n\nAnalysis published by the Sutton Trust in 2019 found that 29% of MPs at the time had attended a private school. Of Conservative MPs, 41% had attended an independent school, in comparison to Labour’s 14%.\n\n“Money matters,” Millar continued. “Through intensive university preparation, outlandish uniforms, networks, the use of absurd language like spaffing and girly swot, or the sense that they are grooming leaders, the system is designed to ensure that pupils emerge feeling better than, and different from, everyone else.”\n\nOn his website, Sunak said: “My parents sacrificed a great deal so I could attend good schools.” His “self-confidence and polish” were “exactly what his parents hoped they were buying when they saved up to send him to Winchester”, said The Guardian.\n\nThe PM himself may have “a private school problem”, said Paul Waugh, the i news site’s chief political commentator. It’s “not so much that he went to a very expensive public school, but that he clearly doesn’t rate the state system as good enough for his own children”.\n\nWith his elder daughter attending a £40,000-a-year boarding school and the other a £23,000-a-year preparatory school, “cutting education budgets further in those circumstances may be difficult indeed”, said Waugh.\n\n‘Social apartheid’\n\nMuch was “made of the apparent ‘diversity’” of Liz Truss’s cabinet, but what was less commented upon was that it was “one of the most socially exclusive cabinets in recent history”, said Byline Times.\n\nResearch published by the Sutton Trust last month found that 68% of Truss’s secretaries of state had attended fee-paying schools, with the trust’s founder and chairman Sir Peter Lampl commenting on “how unevenly spread opportunities to enter the most prestigious positions continue to be”.\n\nThe charity’s research indicates that the proportion of privately educated cabinet members has increased in recent years, with the numbers more than doubling during Johnson’s premiership to 64% compared to Theresa May’s 30%.\n\n“The past decade has given us a relentless insight into this very sophisticated form of social apartheid that private schools represent,” said Millar.\n\nShe called for “sanctions on this type of privilege before another generation of that tiny but powerful elite comes along to do even more damage to the country”.", "authors": ["The Week"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/africa/africa-universities-excluded-uk-work-visa-intl/index.html", "title": "UK to grant visas to graduates from the world's best universities but ...", "text": "Britain will offer work visas to graduates from the world’s best universities in an expansion of its post-Brexit immigration system that is designed to attract the “best and brightest” workers. But no African universities are included in the list of eligible institutions.\n\nUnder the scheme announced on Monday, graduates with a bachelor’s or master’s degree from the top 50 universities abroad can apply for a two-year work visa and will be allowed to bring family members with them. Those who receive doctorates can apply for a three-year visa.\n\nSuccessful applicants will then be able to switch to longer-term employment visas, the government said.\n\nEligible universities must appear in the top 50 rankings of at least two of the following: the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings. Those rankings must be for the year of the applicant’s graduation, which must be within the past five years.\n\nThe most recent list of eligible universities from 2021, published online by the UK government, comprises more than two dozen US universities, as well as institutions in Canada, Japan, Germany, China, Singapore, France and Sweden. No African university is on the latest eligibility list, nor on lists for previous years.\n\nThe decision to exclude graduates from African universities has been criticized.\n\n“To exclude an entire continent brimming over with the enormous creative and intellectual energies of its youth on the basis of its absence from arbitrary, culturally biased, abuse-prone university rankings is shortsighted….Several unranked African universities have produced, and continue to produce, some of the brightest minds in the world.” said Professor Farooq Kperogi of the Kennesaw State University, Georgia.\n\n“University rankings are a Euro-American obsession. They are no more than perceptions of institutional prestige and name recognition…which do not necessarily reflect quality,” Kperogi added.\n\n“It is unfortunate that African graduates are being excluded,” said Dr. Owoyemi Elegbeleye of Nigeria’s University of Lagos. “The UK government should consider a spread in this policy so that Africans can benefit. They can spread the eligibility list to the top 300,” he told CNN.\n\nIrina Filatova, an emeritus professor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, remarked that the ranking system was “skewed in favor of English language and technological universities.”\n\n“It is good that universities compete, but the problem is that the system of ranking is skewed in favor of English language and technological universities.

She told The Sunday Times that her upbringing was “typically immigrant”, with her parents “always working really hard, saving all their money, always doing the right thing, heads down”.\n\nShe was 15 when the family moved to England because her father, an Indian-Guyanese academic who was “warm but strict”, had begun lecturing at the University of Warwick.\n\nShe studied philosophy and modern languages at New College, Oxford. As an undergraduate she discovered her passion for education when she visited inner-city schools to encourage the children to apply to Oxbridge.\n\n‘Tory teacher’\n\nAfter graduating, Birbalsingh went into teaching in state schools in south London. In 2007 she set up an anonymous blog, To Miss with Love, where she wrote about her colleagues and children, soon getting up to 500 views a day.\n\nHer posts attracted the attention of Steve Hilton, the Conservative Party’s director of strategy, who invited her to speak alongside Michael Gove, then the education secretary, at the party’s conference in 2010, where she spoke of a “culture of excuses” and “low standards” in classrooms.\n\nIn a particularly headline-grabbing section of her speech at a fringe event, she said: “If you keep telling teachers that they’re racist for trying to discipline black boys and if you keep telling heads that they’re racist for trying to exclude black boys, in the end the schools stop reprimanding these children,” the Daily Mail reported at the time.\n\nAfter her speech hit the headlines she lost her teaching job. When she tried to open a free school in Brixton shortly afterwards, it was mobbed with placards saying “Tory teacher”. She was called a traitor and a Nazi, said The Times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-career-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "How scandals of Boris Johnson's own making brought him down ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader Thursday, bringing his scandal-plagued tenure to an end after less than three years.\n\nJohnson was left with little choice but to step down after several high-profile members of his cabinet resigned in protest this week over his handling of misconduct allegations related to government officials. Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy. The man who only ever wanted to be taken seriously ended up, ultimately, as the joker once again.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}]}

He and his brother and cousin played in that car for hours every day.\n\n\"We'd all hop in and pretend like we were cruising down the street or running from the bad guys,\" said Schuckman, now 26, of Taylor. \"My parents were both working and they'd drop us off at my cousin's in the summertime. We had nothing to do. When you're kids, everything is a jungle gym.\"\n\nHe can't remember exactly how the dents to the hood and roof happened, injuries to the vehicle that his Uncle Dennis couldn't afford to repair at first and then decided not to repair when he had the money.\n\nTo Dennis Wallace, the 1986 Ford Escort GT is a family heirloom.\n\nIt is restored, cherished and protected like a precious diamond now.\n\nFor Wallace, the Escort represents a time long gone, when children didn't spend so many hours with video games, cellphones, tablets and other computer technology — instead passing time with each other, laughing and making up stories. It reminds him of miles traveled with a younger brother who has died, and how far his family has come despite struggles because they supported each other.\n\nAnd, sometimes, it reminds him that people with little money can be the richest of all.\n\nThis is the story of a car model that hundreds of thousands of people have left on a trash heap. But one family has kept it like a scrapbook. Some people collect expensive cars, like classic Mustangs and vintage Lincoln Continentals, but not Wallace.\n\n\"I was 25 years old when I purchased my new 1986 Ford Escort GT from Ray Whitfield Ford in Taylor. I took delivery on April 3, 1986, and drove that Escort for my job as a computer tech for the White Castle hamburger chain,\" said Wallace, 59, who retired as an assistant maintenance supervisor. \"I drove that Escort until 1992, when I had to park it due to engine problems. It had 142,692 miles. I put a cover on it until 2012, when we had the money to make repairs to make it drivable again.\"\n\nThe dents in the hood and roof, well, that happened when his son, Derick, was 7 and his nephews Cody and Connor, 5 and 3, were playing on Christmas Day 1999.\n\n\"I heard a lot of noise coming from the garage. I opened the door and the boys were standing on top of the Escort. I asked them to get off the car, it was time to open gifts,\" Wallace said. \"When I uncovered the Escort in 2012, I discovered the many dents. We had the money to fix the dents by then. But as of Oct. 23, 2020, they remain.\"\n\nThe dents remind him of children's laughter.\n\nCars and trucks\n\nThat car, Cody Schuckman said, \"sparked a part\" in his uncle's heart.\n\n\"We grew up going to a lot of car shows together,\" Schuckman said. \"We would always go to the Telegraph Cruise. I remember being at Southgate at Burger King, so they must have done car shows there. When we finally got it running, our adventure-mobile came to life as teenagers.\"\n\nThey spent time with that little car while their mother worked as a medical aide at U.S. Steel and their father, an Iraq War veteran, served as an Air National Guardsman who came home to test airplane engine parts in Ann Arbor.\n\nThat little boy grew up to become a UAW technician, waterproofing the shell of Ford F-150 trucks before they're painted at the Dearborn Truck Plant. These days, Schuckman reflects about being a father and his kids and what it all means, and how families spend time together.\n\nHis brother Connor, now 24, a cement worker from Allen Park, said, \"My cousin, brother and I loved that car growing up. We would get inside and act like we were cruising around on whatever adventure we had going. Still to this day, the car brings a nostalgic feeling of all the memories and adventures we had in it. A literal time capsuleto our childhood fun.\"\n\nEscort vs. Mustang\n\nPassion for the Ford Mustang might be expected.\n\nPassion for a Ford Escort GT is somewhat unusual.\n\nThe Mustang is a legendary muscle car. The Escort GT is the sporty version of an unassuming compact.\n\nJack Telnack said the whole thing is sort of shocking and wonderful at the same time.\n\nTelnack, 83, of Grosse Ile is the former vice president of global design at Ford best known for his incredible work on the Mustang and the Taurus. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nNo one, ever, has asked him to autograph a Ford Escort. Until now.\n\n\"I signed it on the instrument panel, the dashboard, and also signed the engine on the air filter,\" Telnack told the Free Press in mid-November, just three weeks after meeting Wallace.\n\nWallace had tracked down the designer, the plant manager, the production line inspector and the painter to sign his car much like a collector of Broadway playbills would have actors sign program pages.\n\n\"It's incredible, I've never seen anything like it,\" Telnack said. \"He was wearing a jacket that had been embroidered on the back, 'My Escort signed by Jack Telnack.' I've never had that before. I was pleased and excited. He was just ecstatic. The car was in absolute mint condition. He had pictures of people who worked on the car, original delivery papers from the dealer. Unbelievable.\"\n\nTelnack worked at Ford from 1958 to 1998 with stints in Europe and Australia and North America. He started at age 22 working on the original 1964-1/2 Mustang.\n\n\"I had the honor of having done the wheel covers and they've must've been good because a lot have been stolen,\" Telnack said. \"I did sketches on the first fastback Mustang about 1963.\" Then the 1979 Fox Mustang, which was a breakthrough in terms of aerodynamics. And the 1983 Thunderbird and the 1986 Taurus.\n\nAs for the Escort, Telnack said, \"I had no idea it would be that important and that kind of a collector item. I was surprised and delighted. It's a great car and fun to drive.\"\n\n\"When I'm driving down the road and I see one of the cars I had a hand in, sometimes I think I could've tweaked it a little here and there. I can't stop designing. That's how it is with designers. You're designing right up until it goes into production,\" he said. \"I had a boss that once said, 'Once the car hits the production line, stop designing.' After all these years, the Escort is still a good looking car. ...\n\nMore:The first Ford Mustang owner kept the car.

I can't think of a greater compliment. It was almost embarrassing,\" said Telnack, who now drives a 2020 Ford Mustang GT and a 2020 Lincoln Aviator SUV.\n\nWhen Telnack's neighbor Courtney Solenberger-McNeill heard of Wallace's passion for his Escort, she set up the meeting at the Grosse Ile Police Department in October.\n\n\"To see a man who cared so much about this little car that he owned, to watch the man who designed it come up and shake his hand, it was powerful, looking at them together,\" said Solenberger-McNeill, 67, of Grosse Ille, who has a '68 Corvette and appreciates families who spend time fixing up classics.\n\n\"I hold the bumper while my husband is screwing in washers,\" she said, having met Wallace at a car show in Leo's Restaurant parking lot in Riverview in August. \"It wasn't really a car show, just a bunch of people who give a damn about vehicles, cleaning them up and bringing their grandkids and walking around.\"\n\nJust part of growing up in Michigan, she said, laughing.\n\nChanging times\n\nMatt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, said traditional classic cars will always play an important role with traditional collectors.\n\nBut Wallace reflects a new trend.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, many museums focused on unusual or expensive cars,\" he said. \"Today most museums — and even many private collectors — are just as interested in the stories behind the cars as they are in the vehicles themselves.\"\n\nErich Merkle, U.S. sales analyst at Ford, said the Escort was an important car.\n\n\"When Escort made its debut in 1980, it was truly a global car for Ford Motor Co. Sales hit their peak in 1985 with almost 440,000 at the time, making it one of America's best-selling cars. 'Out of Africa' received the Academy Award for best picture that year, the top billboard song was 'Careless Whisper.' \"\n\nFor Wallace, whose younger brothers had Fox Body Mustangs, the Escort is priceless.\n\n\"At the time, I was just buying a new home, I was single, money was kind of tight. The Escort seemed to be the most economical car,\" Wallace said. \"My brothers and father worked for Fords. My brother Jamie, he's a forklift driver at the Mustang plant in Flat Rock. There now with the UAW for 22 years. He's 49.\"\n\nHis brother Jeff, who would've turned 56 in October, died in an accident in 2016. The two brothers grew up learning about cars together, and that's part of the Escort love.\n\n\"Jeff and I, and our father, he was a real car nut. We didn't get to grow up with him so much. Our stepfather, Edward, we got more involved in cars with him,\" Wallace said. \"He did body and paint work and that's kind of how we got into cars. He did work for Fords Dearborn Assembly.\"\n\nLooking back, Wallace remembers meeting his wife, Shanna, when they both worked at White Castle. He moved from Lincoln Park to Taylor. They married in 1989 and welcomed their son Derick, whose wife, Samantha, is now expecting a second child.

Though the annual park and meetup in August is primarily for Mustang owners, other Ford owners are welcome, too.\n\n\"You park with all the non-Mustang cars in with all the others, any year, it doesn't matter — Fairlanes, Torinos,\" said Wallace, who drives a 2013 F-150 now. \"After my brother Jeff had passed in 2016, I was inspired to go on a journey with this car.\"\n\nThe beloved Escort had a sticker of $9,665 with a $100 discount in 1986.\n\n\"A lot of people tell me they drove this car when they were 16 or 17. It's a rare car now because they were daily drivers,\" Wallace said. \"Our son Derick is now 28 years old. The Escort GT will be his when we are up in heaven.\"\n\nA son responds\n\nDerick Wallace, during his lunch break on Thanksgiving eve as a warehouse worker in Oregon, Ohio, said his father never has talked about his death or what might happen to the beloved Escort.\n\n\"It was down for so long and now it's running right and he takes it to car shows and has won awards. It makes me happy that the car makes him happy. You're not going to find another Escort like that running and looking as good as it is. Most are in the junkyard or scrapped out,\" he said.\n\nWhen told of his father's mention of heaven, Derick Wallace responded with silence.\n\n\"That's news to me. He never actually told me that. It's bittersweet he said that, and I just hope I can take care of it good enough when I do inherit it,\" he said. \"That car will definitely stay in the family. It's not going anywhere.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

But his other task — shepherding the country through a recession — is poised to be just as daunting.\n\nThe former finance minister has won the race to replace Liz Truss, his erstwhile opponent who’s set to be the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. He’ll officially step into the role once appointed by King Charles III.\n\nSunak said Monday that it was his “utmost priority to bring our party and our country together” in the face of a “profound economic challenge.”\n\nInvestors cautiously welcomed news of his victory. The pound moved in and out of the red against the US dollar on Monday. It was last trading above $1.13, about 0.1% higher. Yields on benchmark 10-year UK bonds, which move opposite prices, fell to 3.76%. The FTSE 250 index of mid-size UK companies gained 1.1%.\n\nSunak campaigned for the job over the summer with promises to help households tackle the rising cost of living, which is causing many to pull back spending. He said he would cut taxes, but only once price pressures eased.\n\nYet the economic outlook has deteriorated sharply since then — not least because of the market turmoil unleashed by Truss’ now-abandoned plan to slash taxes as soon as possible and boost government borrowing.\n\nA closely watched gauge of economic activity dropped to a 21-month low in October. S&P Global, which tracks the data, said it effectively confirms the United Kingdom is in a recession.\n\n“The heightened political and economic uncertainty has caused business activity to fall at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009, if pandemic lockdown months are excluded,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nRishi Sunak, former UK chancellor, arrives at his office in London on Monday, Oct. 24. Jason Alden/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAs Truss’ disastrous tax cut plan proved, any economic stimulus beyond immediate support for energy bills could prove to be a nonstarter for Sunak.\n\n“A key focus for the next Prime Minister and their chosen Chancellor needs to be fiscal responsibility,” Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said in a statement. “We need a credible plan to ensure that government debt can be expected to fall over the medium-term.”\n\nAlthough one top Bank of England official indicated last week that investors may be pricing in too many interest rate hikes, the central bank is expected to remain tough in the near-term in its campaign to get inflation under control.\n\nAn economy in recession\n\nThe Bank of England forecast last month that the UK economy was already in recession. Evidence to support that view is growing. The country’s output shrank by 0.3% in August, following an expansion of just 0.1% in July.\n\nA government report released Friday showed retail sales fell 1.4% in September, a worse-than-expected drop. And consumer confidence is near its worst level on record as inflation is back at a 40-year high.\n\nDean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management, called the spending outlook “pretty grim, to say the least.” The main questions now, he said, are how long a contraction lasts and how deep it becomes.\n\nThe picture of the United Kingdom’s financial position also darkened with the release of data on Friday showing that Britain’s government borrowed a net £20 billion ($22 billion) in September, £5.2 billion ($5.7 billion) more than the country’s fiscal watchdog had expected.\n\n“The weakness in retail sales and overshoot of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s March public borrowing forecast won’t make the next Prime Minister’s task any easier in navigating the economy through the cost of living crisis, cost of borrowing crisis and the cost of credibility crisis,” Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.\n\nA customer pushes a shopping cart into an Aldi supermarket in Sheffield on Saturday, Oct. 15. Dominic Lipinski/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe cost of uncertainty\n\nInvestors and economists expect the revamped economic plan outlined by current finance minister Jeremy Hunt to remain intact.\n\nLast week, Hunt — just days into the job himself — announced the rollback of almost all tax cuts in Truss’ original “growth plan,” which had been rejected by investors.\n\nCiting a renewed commitment to controlling the country’s debts, Hunt also said the government will universally cap energy prices only until April. Support beyond then will cost taxpayers “significantly less than planned,” he added.\n\n“Whoever becomes PM — and even if they decide to change the Chancellor — it seems to me that the fiscal path is pretty much set in stone, because the markets will not tolerate anything other than what’s on the table,” Turner said.\n\nThat could help keep financial markets in check, though firm assurances and more detail on budget plans would be welcome at a time when bond markets around the world are showing signs of strain, said James Athey, investment director at Abrdn, an asset manager.\n\n“It just again keeps the pause button pressed on international investor engagement,” Athey said.\n\nThere’s also some ambiguity about the Bank of England’s next moves. Ben Broadbent, deputy director of monetary policy, warned last Thursday that investors may have gotten ahead of themselves in projecting rate hikes amid the recent chaos.\n\n“Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen,” he said in a speech.\n\nThe central bank is still expected to be very tough at its November and December meetings. If the economy slows sharply next year, it could later pull back. That said, if the government withdraws some support for energy bills in April, that could reignite inflationary pressures — once again complicating the calculus.\n\n“Let’s be honest, we have no idea what the energy price will be in April, so we have no idea what the effect will be on household budgets,” Turner said.\n\nThat leaves investors guessing for longer, and economists waiting to revise their forecasts.\n\n“Clarity and certainty, unfortunately, are all too absent,” Athey said.\n\n— Sugam Pokharel contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-announcement-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK Tory leadership race: What time will Britain's new prime minister ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritons will find out later Monday who will be their next prime minister as the country faces a looming economic and humanitarian crisis, almost two months after Boris Johnson quit in the wake of a series of scandals.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET) the ruling Conservative Party will announce the results of its leadership election, in which the two contenders in the final round, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak, sharply criticized each other’s plans.\n\nTruss, a low-tax evangelist and the poster-child for the British Conservative right, is the strong favorite to beat Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who voted for Brexit but has now taken a softer tone on how the UK should deal with the EU.\n\nThe winner of the contest will, as leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, take over as prime minister until the next general election, which must be held by December 2024.\n\nWhoever triumphs will likely travel Tuesday to meet Queen Elizabeth II to receive an invitation to form a government. The reception is typically held at Buckingham Palace, but the 96-year-old monarch is at her Scottish residence in Balmoral and, for the first time in her reign, she will receive Johnson and his successor there.\n\nBut the next PM’s celebrations are likely to be brief, with a spiraling cost-of-living crisis – average annual energy bills alone are set to rise 80% to £3,549 (approximately $4,180) from October – threatening to overwhelm much of the country. On Sunday, speaking on a BBC political show, Truss refused to discuss her plans to tackle rising bills, but added, “what I want to reassure people is, I will act if elected as prime minister within one week.”\n\nTruss is the clear frontrunner to win most votes among ordinary Conservative Party members in the leadership election. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, Truss has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nCritics have accused her of playing politics with Brexit, adopting a hardline stance in a cynical attempt to win votes. They pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life, Truss’s politics have evolved from being in her youth an anti-monarchist in favor of legalizing drugs, to the embodiment of the right-wing of the Conservative Party. Truss’s campaign platform has featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hardline against the EU on Brexit, to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nUnlike Truss, Sunak did vote to leave the EU in 2016 and has made repeated promises to get rid of EU regulation. He spent the early days of his campaign criticizing Truss’s plans for tax cuts, though he has to some extent followed her lead.\n\nSunak won plaudits early in the coronavirus pandemic for using government money to assist people who lost their jobs or couldn’t run their businesses. He was later hit with a fine for attending a party with Johnson during lockdown, and came under scrutiny over the tax arrangements of his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nRough road ahead\n\nWhatever the outcome, Sunak or Truss will take over a Conservative government facing multiple crises after 12 years in power. As well as the cost-of-living crisis, the next prime minister must address crumbling public services and a looming winter of strikes, all while making the case that the Conservatives deserve to win a historic fifth term at the next general election.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the soaring cost of energy, food and fuel amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter recession before the end of the year.\n\nAs far as this affects the leadership contest, analysts are skeptical that either candidate’s policies will help. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group, last month said the leadership contestants, who both promise tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nLooming over the new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, who leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister whose missteps led approval ratings for the Conservative Party to plummet.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 – less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019 – after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His announcement followed months of revelations over illegal parties held in Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, he rode out the so-called “Partygate” scandal for months, and it was only when his deputy chief whip was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party and Johnson delayed in acting that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nWhether or not Johnson will remain in politics is unknown. He may be forced to resign as a member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on an investigation into the Partygate scandal and whether Johnson knowingly misled Parliament. Johnson had earlier claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson will doubtless remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to how it was before he entered Downing Street.\n\nAnd his legacy will be difficult for either Truss or Sunak to distance themselves from. Truss is widely seen as the Johnson continuity candidate while Sunak, despite resigning from Johnson’s cabinet and triggering the PM’s downfall, was his finance minister during the pandemic and is closely associated with Johnson’s premiership.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/liz-truss-british-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss is a political shape-shifter. Now she's set for her toughest ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss, the next prime minister of the United Kingdom, is a political chameleon who has gone from a radical who called for the abolition of the monarchy to a flag-bearer of the Euroskeptic right wing of the Conservative Party.\n\nTruss, who was only elected to parliament in 2010, has – in a relatively short period of time – established herself as a political force of nature who pursues her agenda with relentless vigor and unequivocal enthusiasm.\n\nBut after a decades-long transformation that has seen her personal views change enormously, many will be asking what exactly Britain’s new leader stands for.\n\nMany who have observed her over the years question whether she has any sincere beliefs at all, or if she simply endorses whatever is the most convenient at the time.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See the moment Tory Party announced Truss won leadership 06:20 - Source: CNN\n\nTo say that Truss, 47, has been on a political journey would be an understatement. She was born in 1975 into a family that she herself has described as “to the left of Labour,” Britain’s main left-wing party. She grew up in parts of the UK that didn’t traditionally vote Conservative, moving between Scotland and the north of England.\n\nIn contrast with her privately educated cabinet colleagues, Truss went to a state school in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, and later won a place at Oxford University. There she was an active member of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist opposition party that has long been an effective opponent to the Conservatives in large parts of England.\n\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the legalization of cannabis and the abolition of the royal family – positions that are at total odds with what most would consider to be mainstream Conservatism in 2022.\n\nTruss says she joined the Conservatives in 1996, just two years after she gave a speech at a Liberal Democrat conference calling for the end of the monarchy.\n\nEven during her time as a Liberal Democrat, her peers questioned her sincerity and spotted traits that they say they still see in her today.\n\n“I honestly think she was playing to the gallery back then, whether she was talking about decriminalizing drugs or abolishing the monarchy,” Neil Fawcett, a Liberal Democrat councilor who campaigned with Truss in the 1990s, told CNN. “I think she is someone who plays to the gallery with whatever audience she is talking to, and I genuinely don’t know if she ever believes anything she says, then or now.”\n\nTruss has certainly continued to capture the attention of her audience. Since joining the Conservatives and becoming a lawmaker, she has fervently supported almost every conceivable ideology. She served loyally under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nMost notably, she supported remaining in the European Union in the UK’s referendum in 2016. At the time, Truss tweeted that she was backing those who wanted to remain in the bloc because “it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nTruss now backs Brexit, saying that her fears before the referendum that it could cause “disruption” were mistaken.\n\nTruss greets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a G7 summit in Liverpool last December. Phil Noble/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRecently, the new leader even went so far in burnishing her Brexiteer credentials as to refuse to call French President Emmanuel Macron an ally. When asked if he was friend or foe during a live broadcast, she said the “jury’s out.”\n\nThere is a debate within the Conservative Party as to how real this support of Euroskepticism is. Some think Truss was reluctantly following government orders, which opposed Brexit, in 2016. Others find that argument inconceivable.\n\nAnna Soubry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and anti-Brexit campaigner, told CNN that Truss “had the most cover out of any of us to support Brexit. Her brief at the time included the farming community, who supported Brexit on the whole. I sat around the cabinet table and heard everyone’s reason for doing what they did and find it hard to believe she’s changed her mind quite this much.”\n\nOn the other hand, Gavin Barwell, who served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief-of-staff, said that, after the Brexit vote, “Truss made a decision very quickly that there wasn’t room for a compromise. If you were to do it, it needed to be done fully. And as the stalemate dragged on, she argued that a binary choice was coming between leaving with no deal and Brexit being reversed, and the latter would be catastrophic for the government.”\n\nTruss has been compared to Margaret Thatcher, who also wore a fur hat on an official visit to Moscow. Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nThe closer she has edged to power, the more Britons have wondered what a Truss premiership would look like. She has campaigned to lead on the most conservative of agendas. She has pledged to slash taxes from day one, tear up EU regulations and encourage private sector growth with low corporation tax. She has said she will not impose a windfall tax on energy companies despite their posting huge profits during the current cost-of-living and energy crisis.\n\nTruss faces a challenge of forging a path for the Conservative Party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for half that period. Dan Kitwood/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThese sorts of policies were, of course, red meat to the Conservative members who ultimately voted for her. And while some of those who know her question how much she actually believes in them, there is little doubt she will put her full effort into implementing them and making her impact immediately felt.\n\nIt’s possible that a Truss government will ultimately look a lot like Johnson’s, but with a greater emphasis on cutting taxes, shrinking the state and, potentially, an even harder line on Europe.\n\nCritics have said the tax cuts she’s promised would lead to even greater inflation and rises in interest rates amid a forecast recession. Questions were also raised over a pledge Truss made to cut public sector pay, allegedly saving the public $8.8 billion. Her economics were questioned by her critics, and the uproar over perceived callousness toward public sector workers forced Truss to U-turn.\n\nJulian Glover, a journalist and speech writer to former Prime Minister David Cameron, was a university contemporary of Truss and remembers traits in her that are still recognizable today: determined but unfocused.\n\n“We only passed each other briefly and she was in a different year to me, but despite that, she stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favor of action and change,” Glover told CNN. “It was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.”\n\nRoger Crouch, who succeeded Truss as president of Oxford University Liberal Democrats, told CNN that he remembers a woman who was “determined, single-minded and willing to challenge orthodox and prevailing, often male, wisdom.”\n\nUnlike many of those who knew Truss in her younger years, Crouch, who is now a teacher, thinks her opinions haven’t changed a huge amount since the 90s. “Liz was always more of a privatizing, libertarian liberal so there is a consistent thread of thought there. I remember a student discussion group in which she advocated privatization of lamp posts.”\n\nThose who know Truss say that while her views have changed over the years, she has always been determined and single-minded. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nPrime Minister Truss will have a hard time uniting her party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for six of them.\n\nShe will also have to lead the country through its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Inflation is at a 40-year high, energy bills are set to increase by hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds a year, and the UK is forecast to enter a recession before the end of the year.\n\nIn July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter a recession before the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’ tax-cutting policies will do much to help citizens. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and lower government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThis winter, many families will have to make a grim choice between heating their homes and eating. And for a party that has been in power for more than a decade, it’s hard to deflect the blame for that onto anyone else.\n\nHer supporters see the chance for a fresh start in Truss. They believe that with Brexit less in the spotlight and the scandals that led to Johnson’s downfall soon to be a distant memory, the party will turn its focus to remaining in power and winning a historic fifth consecutive general election.\n\nAfter a vicious battle between Truss and Rishi Sunak (left), some question whether the new prime minister can keep the party in power at the next election. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nFor her detractors, it is more complicated. During this leadership contest those who have supported her rivals feel they have been unfairly maligned simply for disputing that Truss should be handed the keys to Downing Street.\n\nWhen it comes to running the country, this could be a problem for Truss. She had the support of fewer MPs than her rival Rishi Sunak during the early stages of the contest and the bad blood between the two camps has worsened over time.\n\nAnd for all Truss’ determination and single-mindedness, she takes over a party torn apart by infighting and suffering in the polls during a domestic crisis. So she may find her key objective – making her party electable at the next general election after so many years in power – too hard a task to achieve.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/crime/955679/levi-bellfield-lin-megan-russell-murders", "title": "Is Levi Bellfield telling the truth about the Russell murders? | The ...", "text": "The man who killed schoolgirl Milly Dowler has reportedly confessed to murdering a woman and her six-year-old daughter six years earlier.\n\nLin and Megan Russell were killed with a claw hammer while they walked home from a swimming gala in Chillenden, near Canterbury, on 9 July 1996.

This time, it really ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBoris Johnson’s Conservative government is in deep crisis, engulfed once more in a scandal that is at least in part of the Prime Minister’s own making.\n\nAnd this time, it’s a lot worse than all the other times.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, after days in which Downing Street has been on the ropes over its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by a member of the government, two senior Cabinet ministers quit.\n\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he could not “in good conscience” continue. Finance minister Rishi Sunak also resigned, saying that people “rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously.” Since then, two further ministers have stepped down and multiple Conservative Members of Parliament have publicly withdrawn their support for Johnson’s leadership.\n\nJohnson is still in control of his own fate, for now. Conservative party rules dictate that if a leader wins a confidence vote, as he did in June, then they are immune from another challenge for 12 months.\n\nHowever, so severe is Johnson’s case that it’s possible the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers might rewrite the rules in order to get rid of him.\n\nThe 1922 executive is expected to meet on Wednesday in order to fix a date for elections as to who should be on the committee. If a large enough number of anti-Boris MPs are elected to the executive, then the chances of the rules changing increases dramatically.\n\nUntil that point, the real question is just how much public humiliation can the PM take?\n\nMore ministers will almost certainly resign and opposition sources are talking up the prospect of defections. At Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Johnson said “the job of a Prime Minister in difficult circumstances when he has been handed a colossal mandate is to keep going and that’s what I’m going to do.”\n\nBut he was eviscerated by opposition MPs, with Labour leader Keir Starmer describing his efforts to cling to power as “a pathetic spectacle” and calling his remaining supporters “a Z-list cast of nodding dogs.”\n\nThe immediate cause of the crisis was the fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations he had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nWhat landed Johnson in deeper trouble, though, were the contortions that Downing Street press officers went into trying to explain why Pincher was ever in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations of his previous conduct. On Tuesday, a senior former civil servant published a letter effectively accusing Downing Street of not telling the truth when it said the Prime Minister was not aware of at least one of the historical allegations.\n\nIn an effort to draw a line under the swirling controversy, Johnson issued a statement in which he apologized and said he was wrong to have reappointed Pincher to the whip’s office – which, ironically, is responsible for party discipline – earlier this year. But that was overtaken within minutes by the resignation of the two Cabinet members.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, he said “regret(s) very much” promoting Pincher despite concerns about his behavior, adding: “In hindsight, I should have realized that he would not change.”\n\nThe details of how Downing Street got itself into such a mess bear laying out. At first, when new reports of Pincher’s historical conduct emerged in the light of his resignation, Downing Street initially denied the Prime Minister knew anything about the allegations.\n\nWhen it became clear this would not hold, Johnson’s team said he had known about the historical allegations, but that they had been “resolved.” When it emerged that one of the previously unreported allegations against Pincher had been upheld, Johnson’s spokesperson explained that “resolved” could mean that it had been upheld.\n\nThen on Tuesday morning, Simon McDonald, the former top civil servant at the Foreign Office revealed that Johnson had been briefed in person about the outcome of an investigation into Pincher’s conduct.\n\nRegardless of any justification Downing Street has attempted to provide, Johnson’s judgment – and his handling of this latest crisis – is now in serious doubt.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Our friends and neighbors look on us with sadness': Journalist on UK government scandals 17:14 - Source: CNN\n\nA common theme of the plethora of scandals surrounding him – from “Partygate,” when Johnson was fined by police for breaching lockdown rules, to his attempts to protect an MP who had breached lobbying rules – is how the government has mishandled the fallout from the initial problem.\n\n“The biggest threat to this government is its own staggering incompetence,” said one senior government official. “Discipline has completely broken down.”\n\n“The team around the Prime Minister seems to have no idea how badly it’s going,” they added. “No one is good at giving interviews. We cannot stick to a single line. We’ve completely lost control.”\n\nA government minister told CNN they believe that one key problem is that Johnson sets the tone for behavior.\n\n“It’s hard for someone with a personal life as colorful as his to reprimand people for behaving inappropriately,” they said.\n\nThe growing sense of chaos – and the view that the government has lost control of yet another story – is doing nothing for Conservatives who think Johnson has become the party’s biggest electoral turn-off.\n\nBoth the Prime Minister’s personal approval ratings and the party’s polling numbers have plummeted since the Partygate scandal broke. Trust in Johnson as a leader appears to be breaking down both with the public and with his own MPs. Conservative Party lawmakers tried – and failed – to unseat him last month.\n\nBut Conservative MPs are starting to lose hope that even if Johnson is removed from power, it won’t be possible to undo the damage he has done to the party before the next scheduled election in 2024.\n\nEven more worryingly for those who have lost faith in the PM, he seems determined to fight on.\n\nThis alarms Conservative MPs, especially those in marginal seats who have all but given up hope of retaining them. Few of them think that Johnson has any real grip on how bad things have got – and they can’t see a way to make the Prime Minister see sense.\n\nThe government’s poor handling of Pincher’s resignation means the scandal is now tied to Johnson personally. He was the one who chose to appoint Pincher to a top job in government – despite knowing how serious the allegations against him were, and even though he was aware that a complaint against him had been upheld.\n\nFor years, Johnson’s main selling point has been his ability to connect with voters, personally. His brand of optimistic populism was – so Conservative MPs thought – the force of nature that had made a majority of the British public vote for Brexit in 2016 and had given the Tories a parliamentary majority of 80 in 2019.\n\nBut as Johnson’s government veers from one crisis to the next, his MPs now fear they are learning the hard way just what happens when a populist loses their popularity.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/energy/uk-energy-bills-october/index.html", "title": "UK household energy bills to soar by 80% in October | CNN Business", "text": "British energy bills will rise 80% to an average of £3,549 ($4,188) a year from October, regulator Ofgem said on Friday, calling it a “crisis” that needed to be tackled by urgent and decisive government action.\n\nOfgem CEO Jonathan Brearley said the rise would have a “massive impact” on households across Britain, and another increase was likely in January, reflecting significant pricing pressure in energy markets.\n\nHe said Britain’s next prime minister — either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak — needed to take immediate action once in office next month.\n\n“It’s clear the new Prime Minister will need to act further to tackle the impact of the price rises that are coming in October and next year,” Brearley said.\n\n“The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us.”\n\nRising wholesale energy prices are hitting countries around the world.\n\nWhile European governments have sought to conserve gas, increase storage and cut bills, Britain’s government has been paralyzed by the race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister on Sept. 5.\n\nThe two candidates have clashed over how to respond.

But how serious is the issue?\n\nAn imperfect science\n\nInsects are critical to the world’s natural environments and ecosystems, performing essential services such as pollination, decomposition and pest control. Yet insects remain “one of our planet’s greatest mysteries, a reminder of how little we know about what’s happening in the world around us”, said The New York Times.\n\nBritain has some of the world’s longest-running data records on insect populations, but the tracking is something of an imperfect science. Monitoring methods include relying on volunteers to conduct counts and record their results, as well as a network of light traps being used to track moths.\n\nAnd there are significant gaps in scientific knowledge about specific species. As efficient pollinators, bees “benefit from a better public image than most insects”, said the Financial Times (FT), while creatures with a reputation for “stinging and biting to damaging foliage and fruit” like wasps have been afforded less focus in scientific research.\n\nSome human interventions undoubtedly had a direct impact on insect populations, including the invention and subsequent proliferation of harmful chemicals used in pesticides to kill off unwanted garden pests. But given how quickly some species can evolve, measuring the impact of climate change, pollution and environment degradation is having is still a huge challenge.\n\nA complicated picture\n\n“The scale of the observed decline raises doubts about how long ecosystems can remain resilient,” said The Economist in 2019.\n\nEven so, the situation is “more complex” than a picture of “imminent global collapse”, said National Geographic. Nature is “dynamic” and there is a “constant reshuffling of communities,” added The Guardian.\n\nIf insect numbers were to plummet, the result “would be catastrophic”, said The Economist. But studies and survey results should “act as a timely warning” as the worst fears are yet “unproven”.\n\n“Most researchers are concerned about insect declines, but most will also caution against the increasingly common hyperbole of impending doom,” said Professor Hill. Focus should instead be shifted to ensuring measures taken to tackle climate change also benefit biodiversity, she said.\n\nWork can also be done to better communicate the benefits of less popular creatures, like wasps. An advocate for the winged creature, Seirian Sumner, a professor of behavioural ecology, wrote in her book Endless Forms: The Secret World of Wasps that the problem with these misunderstood insects “is people”.\n\n“The occasional sting,” said the FT, “is a small cross to bear for the benefits they bring to your garden.”\n\nThe Overview\n\nHow serious are current threats to insect populations?

Only 80% of the US$100bn promised annually by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate their emissions and adapt to climate change has been delivered.\n\nThe failure to meet the amount developing countries need to adapt to climate change means the world faces a life sentence of escalating climate impacts. Those impacts that we won’t be able to prevent or adapt to are referred to as “loss and damage” in the lingo of international climate policy and they are already beginning to bite in the most vulnerable countries. The failure of Cop26 to commit to keeping warming below 1.5C will mean more such loss and damage in future.\n\nSome consider work on loss and damage to be a form of compensation for the harm rich countries have indirectly caused poor ones by disproportionately contributing to climate change with their greenhouse gas emissions. Others prefer the term “climate reparations”, and yet others talk about “solidarity funds”.\n\nHowever you describe it, the fine print of the previous UN climate treaty, the 2015 Paris agreement, sought to squash any notion of developed countries being liable. But the outcome of Cop26 shows that the issue of who is responsible and who should pay for the consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored. However, even the annual climate funding that has been pledged doesn’t include any money allocated for loss and damage.\n\nWho should pay?\n\nThe idea of paying for loss and damage was introduced with the first UN climate treaty negotiations in 1991 as something owed to small island states. But over the years, other groups, including the poorest countries and others across Africa, have begun to champion the issue.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955249/11-of-the-best-tabloid-stories-of-2021", "title": "11 of 2021's strangest tabloid stories | The Week UK", "text": "Erotic novels in village library\n\nA prankster caused a stir in the West Yorkshire village of Cornholme, by placing erotic novels in the village’s unofficial “mini library”.

Its promoter condemned Ocean City officials, the media and others, writing in a letter that they unfairly tied the event to a flood of unruly visitors in the town.\n\nThe event's relocation has done little to quell the droves of spectators and drivers who flock to the Eastern Shore at the end of September to showcase often heavily modified vehicles with burnouts, doughnuts and other daring roadway displays.\n\nAlthough these visitors may be filling hotel rooms and patronizing local restaurants and bars as the resort season begins to wind down, they've also earned the ire of locals and town leaders who have described their behavior over the years as disruptive, disappointing, dangerous and appalling.\n\nHere's a look back at how H2Oi got its start in Worcester County and the evolution that spawned an independent gathering of thousands of car enthusiasts who continue to come back even after the formal event's relocation.\n\nCirca 2000: H2Oi car show begins its tenure on Eastern Shore\n\nAn article published in an August 2011 edition of The Daily Times said the official car show actually started in Connecticut.\n\nIn its third year, the event moved to Ocean Downs in Berlin, putting its Worcester County debut at about 2000.\n\nMore on H2O:Fines, arrests, tons of police, yet Ocean City has yet to shake H2Oi. What else can be done\n\nPromoter Jay Shoup said in the 2011 article that the car show started out as a barbecue at his home with a small showing of about 200 vehicles. Each year, the event grew \"exponentially,\" he said, with 1,300 registered cars and 6,000 attendees at its 2010 iteration.\n\n2011: Car show relocates from Ocean Downs\n\nIn 2011, an article in The Daily Times shows H2Oi relocated from the Berlin casino to a nearby property owned by Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic School.\n\nThat year, social media users speculated there may not be a car show at all following the 2010 event. Those speculations led to competition. However, a Volkswagen meetup scheduled for the same weekend folded after confirmation the annual car show would go on as usual.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ocean City Police Department at the time told The Daily Times that traffic violations during the car show's 2010 weekend included racing from Coastal Highway red lights, spinning out U-turns on wet pavement and speeding.\n\nThe agency reported receiving twice as many calls about car crashes that weekend compared to the same time the previous year.\n\nIn addition, the police chief in 2010 told The Daily Times the weekend had the department \"stretched thin,\" with hundreds gathering at the Roland E. Powell Convention Center parking lot, where drinking and fighting caused problems.\n\n2012: H2Oi sets up shop at Whaleyville campground\n\nA 2013 OceanCity.com piece shows the event moved once again in 2012, making its new official headquarters the Fort Whaley Campground.\n\nPoor drainage at the Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic School property, where the 2011 event took place, coupled with wet weather that year prompted the relocation.\n\nMore:2022 music festival in works for Ocean City on likely weekend of unofficial H2Oi\n\nIn an effort to alleviate issues, the event's timeline also shifted in 2012 so that it would no longer coincide with Ocean City's Sunfest activities, according to OceanCity.com.\n\nIt's a shift Shoup highlighted in a 2018 letter as a favor to town leaders, law enforcement and community members that, he wrote, ultimately \"has proven to be a poor decision, based off the weather.\"\n\n2014: Police takes on horse assaults, illegally modified cars\n\nAs visitors flooded the resort town in 2014, police said two different men took swings at one of the department's horses while the mounted officer was working crowd control.\n\nDelmarva Now reported the first incident occurred at about 1:15 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 27, when a 23 year old of Norristown, Pennsylvania, struck the horse known as Benson and reached under his saddlebag. Another nearby officer stopped him.\n\nAbout an hour later, police said a 26 year old of North Arlington, New Jersey, attempted a similar maneuver and was arrested by Benson's mounted officer, Joseph Laughlin. Both men were charged with interfering with a police animal.\n\nThat year, police told Delmarva Now that officers also made efforts to crack down on vehicle modifications that would not pass Maryland inspections, such as tires at \"unsafe levels.\" Those violations resulted in tickets as well as several cars being towed.\n\n2015: Nor'easter dampens unofficial H2Oi presence in Ocean City\n\nBecause of a nor'easter, the 2015 H2Oi weekend had a smoother and quieter presence in Ocean City.\n\n\"To the ones who think H2Oi is a free-for-all and no rules or laws exist while attending H2Oi and staying in OCMD, I hope to make this crystal clear ... I don't want you,\" the official H2Oi account posted to Facebook in anticipation of the 2015 event.\n\nBackground:State police make 460 traffic stops during H2Oi 2015\n\nIt was reported the Ocean City Police Department fielded 773 calls for service from Thursday through Sunday — a nearly 30 percent drop compared to 2014. Police data from 2010 through 2015 showed there were an average of about 53 arrests in on H2Oi weekends, but there were less than 40 during the 2015 edition.\n\n2017: Official event cancelled, but \"appalling\" behavior still comes to Ocean City\n\nH2Oi continued its tenure in Whaleyville until 2017, when the event promoter announced the car show would be postponed until 2018, less than a month before car enthusiasts were expected to descend on Worcester County.\n\nThe delay was the result of \"changes in venue options and a diminishing timeline,\" according to an official statement posted on the H2Oi website.\n\nMore:What is H2Oi?\n\nMore:H2Oi founder critical of Ocean City, police, Cruisin' car show\n\nIt was the first time the formal event had been canceled in its nearly two-decade run in Worcester, yet drivers and spectators alike still made the trek to Ocean City for the purpose of an unsanctioned, social-media driven gathering independent of the official yearly event.\n\nMany visitors that year engaged in what town officials condemned as \"unruly\" and \"appalling\" behavior.\n\nMajor incidents that year:\n\nDecember 2017: First Ocean City Motor Events Task Force meeting\n\nIn the wake of the September 2017 unofficial and unsanctioned H2Oi gathering, Ocean City's town leaders created a 27-member task force to develop solutions aimed at curbing issues with major motor vehicle events in the area.\n\nComposed of residents, business owners, local organization members, nonresident representatives, event representatives and town staff, the Motor Events Task Force had its first meeting, which was open to the public, in December 2017.\n\nThough not all viable, the group brought several ideas to the table, including calling in the National Guard, creating special enforcement zones, expanding impounding rules and developing targeted social media messaging.\n\nApril 2018: Maryland enacts special event zone law\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation in April 2018 that allowed Ocean City to deploy special event zoning.\n\nIt's a tactic that lowers speed limits throughout town for the dates surrounding certain events, while at the same time raising fines for traffic violations to as high as $1,000 — similar to construction zones. The idea came out of the Motor Events Task Force and was spearheaded in Annapolis by Eastern Shore lawmakers.\n\nBackground:'Look at H2Oi as a hurricane': Ocean City task force tackles car events\n\nBackground:Ocean City to test special event zone for Cruisin'\n\nThe resort town put the new law to the test for the first time from May 15-20, 2018, for the Cruisin' Ocean City event.\n\nJuly 2018: H2Oi finds new home in New Jersey, but Ocean City is ready anyway\n\nIn a July 2018 Instagram post, the H2Oi account officially announced the car show would be based that year at The Showboat Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nHowever, social media activity made it clear that many still planned to show up in Ocean City. Comments stated, \"See y'all in OC Maryland\" and \"We don't care, we're all still going to Ocean City.\"\n\nMore:H2Oi's spirit alive in Ocean City in 2018, despite event's official move\n\nDespite the event's official relocation, an Ocean City Police Department spokesperson said the agency was bracing for crowds similar to what had been seen in past years.\n\nIn 2017, police data shows more calls for service, traffic stops and arrests during the Thursday through Sunday period that would have coincided with H2Oi than the same period in the previous four years, even though the official event had been cancelled.\n\nOctober 2018: Special event zone law deemed success\n\nOfficials dubbed special event zoning a success after deploying it during the 2018 unofficial H2Oi gathering. Officers issued 400 more traffic citations than the previous year.\n\nA photo of one driver's citations that circulated social media showed he racked up more than $1,500 in fines for going 75 mph in the Special Event Zone and using a cellphone while driving.\n\n2019: Clashes with law enforcement reach new high\n\nVideo captured of this year's unofficial H2Oi activities showcased high tensions between visitors and law enforcement, as well as behavior that Mayor Rick Meehan described in a Facebook post as \"havoc\" that had the town \"under siege and in danger.\"\n\nWhat now takes place in Ocean City is organized solely on social media without any single organizer or promoter responsible for the chaos. Membership in public and closed Facebook groups aimed at planning for the Ocean City gathering ranges from a few hundred to more than 60,000 users.\n\nBackground:Unofficial H2Oi: Ocean City mayor vows it 'can't happen again'\n\nMore:Unofficial H2Oi car event comes to Ocean City and brings joy, anger and tire smoke\n\nMore:Here's how many people were arrested at 2019 unofficial H2Oi in Ocean City\n\nMajor incidents included:\n\n2020: Disorder intensifies as enforcement steps up\n\nOcean City and its law enforcement partners across the state vowed to step up enforcement and maintain order after the chaos of 2019.\n\nNumerous confrontations ensued Friday night involving drivers, bystanders and police.\n\nPerhaps the most notorious was caught on video by a local photographer. The footage showed an individual shoulder-checking a state trooper as the trooper took another person into custody who had just been tackled to the ground.\n\nThe town had already suspended public transportation for the weekend and at least a handful of Ocean City eateries shut their doors early after Friday night's disorder.\n\nThe chaos intensified Saturday night, with law enforcement cutting off driver access between 52nd Street and the Route 50 Bridge. Much of downtown had become impassible because of \"large disorderly crowds\" according to police.\n\nBackground:H2Oi police deployment to Ocean City among largest in state history, MSP says\n\nBackground:Crowds take over parts of downtown Ocean City H2Oi 2020 escalates\n\nBackground:H2Oi 'disrespected our community,' but Ocean City officials say their plan worked\n\nVarious social media posts showed gatherings on Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue, including at least one video of rally-goers completely blocking a roadway.\n\nPolice said more than 100 people had been arrested and charged with various criminal and traffic offenses by 5 a.m. Sunday. While they deemed the weekend's disorder \"unacceptable,\" Ocean City officials said plans to crack down on illegal behavior worked.\n\nLaw enforcement issued more than 3,500 citations, pulled over nearly 2,500 vehicles, towed more than 350 vehicles and arrested several hundred individuals throughout the course of H2Oi, according to Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\n2021: Plenty of impounds but relative calm\n\nThe noticeably smaller H2Oi crowd in 2021 was greeted with increased police presence and enforcement in Ocean City, as well as lower speed limits, increased fines, rumble strips and more than 40 tow trucks ready to confiscate \"unsafe\" vehicles.\n\nH2Oi groups and hashtags on social media were filled with stories of expensive impoundments. Multiple people reported receiving speeding tickets with more than $600 fines.\n\nRIDE ALONG:H2Oi 2021: Seeing a police officer's perspective during quieter evening\n\n'Much different than years past':Ocean City noticeably calmer as H2Oi 2021 met with heavy police enforcement\n\n\"While we experienced isolated incidents, the event over all was much different than years past,\" Ocean City Police Department Chief Ross Buzzuto said in a statement.\n\nThough the streets saw some traffic and drag racing, they also saw plenty of cars being impounded.\n\nThe town reported only 134 arrests in 2021; there were 277 the year prior.\n\nFEWER TROUBLES:H2Oi 2021: Relatively calm Friday night in stark contrast to Ocean City a year ago\n\n2022: Ocean City breathes sigh of relief, but New Jersey slammed\n\nSocial media chatter ahead of H2Oi 2022 noted less interest in Ocean City, favoring a move to Wildwood, New Jersey.\n\nBut Ocean City wasn't taking any chances of a return of the pop-up event after a relatively calm 2021. The resort held a police motorcycle rodeo, a police K-9 competition, a dog show event, concerts, along with a hunting and fishing expo, over the traditional weekend for the gathering this year.\n\nIt had originally hoped for a major music festival to take over, but the three-day Oceans Calling rock festival — featuring Alanis Morrisette, Cyndi Lauper, the Lumineers, Cage the Elephant and Dave Matthews with Tim Reynolds — was moved to the following weekend, Sept 30-Oct. 2, for scheduling of acts.\n\nWith Special Event Zone traffic measures in place, fewer cars turned out in Maryland although Ocean City police reported 41 arrests from Sept. 20-25 when the town designated a Special Event Zone in anticipation of the “Pop-up Rally” event. Wildwood, however, was slammed with H2Oi visitors.\n\n\"This was a nightmare,\" Wildwood Mayor Pete Byron told Fox 29. \"This wasn't supposed to happen.\"\n\nTwo people — a pedestrian and vehicle passenger — were killed in one of a string of car crashes, according to NJ.com.\n\n\"We need the National Guard,\" was what the mayor told Fox 29 he had told the governor that night — a measure Ocean City and Maryland had weighed in the past.\n\nAdditional incidents in New Jersey included burnouts, racing, a car striking a building, injuries in a golf cart vs. vehicle, hundreds of people filling parking lots and, at times, blocking access by police.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/15/expulsion-end-rainbow-benedict-arnold-batman-thief-news-around-states/41002381/", "title": "Expulsion at end of rainbow, Benedict Arnold: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nJasper: Police are looking for a man who disguised himself as Batman while stealing musical instruments from churches. A burglary happened Dec. 11 at King’s Way Church in Irondale, AL.com reports. The caped crook stole a keyboard and a guitar, according to Irondale Detective Sgt. Michael Mangina. The suspect came back to the same church Jan. 6 and stole two more guitars. Both times the impostor used a rock to enter the church, Mangina said. On Jan. 9, two churches in Jasper and one in unincorporated Walker County were also burglarized, Jasper police wrote on Facebook. Musical instruments and electronics were also stolen. Anyone with information can call Irondale police, Jasper police or the Walker County Sheriff’s Office. “We have to take this bad guy off the streets,” Mangina said. “Stealing from a church is not the way to get to heaven.”\n\nAlaska\n\nSkwentna: Weeks after a man’s remote cabin burned down, he was rescued by Alaska State Troopers who found him by a makeshift shelter with an SOS signal stamped in the snow. Tyson Steele, 30, was picked up Thursday in what appeared to be good health at his remote homestead 20 miles outside Skwentna, troopers said in a dispatch. A mid-December fire had killed his dog and left Steele with no means of communication, Steele told troopers. After his family members and friends hadn’t heard from him for several weeks, they requested a welfare check. The trooper helicopter crew reached the homestead about 11 a.m. and saw Steele waving his arms near the makeshift shelter. Skwentna, with a population of 35, is 70 miles northwest of Anchorage. The trooper helicopter transported Steele to Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The force was strong enough at a local store to reunite Luke Skywalker with his long-lost vinyl record. Actor Mark Hamill is praising workers at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange for returning the “Star Wars: A New Hope” soundtrack that had been a gift from film composer John Williams. Hamill tweeted that it felt “totally unexpected & positively surreal” to get back the record he hadn’t seen since the early 1990s. He commended the store for being honest and not selling it. Williams had written on the vinyl’s sleeve: “Dear Mark Hamill, May the force always be with us.” The record was one of numerous “Star Wars” items brought in by a woman after her father’s death in 2018. Micheil Salmons, the store’s general manager, said Hamill signed a DVD of “Star Wars: A New Hope” and two medals that are replicas of those given to his character and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, in the film.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican governor on Monday defended his decision to continue accepting new refugees, challenging skeptical GOP lawmakers to avoid creating “fear” about welcoming people from other countries. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told a legislative committee that fewer than 50 refugees will likely be resettled in Washington County in northwestern Arkansas under his decision. Arkansas is among 42 states that have said they will continue to accept refugees since the Trump administration issued an order in September that gave state and local governments the authority to refuse to accept them for the first time in history. “Each of you are leaders in your community. You’ve got a choice to make: You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear,” Hutchinson told lawmakers. He introduced them to two refugees from Congo and another from Afghanistan who have resettled to Arkansas in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding a California butterfly to the list of threatened species, officials say. The agency wants the Hermes copper butterfly added to the list in recognition of the threats it faces in its home region of San Diego County, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico’s Baja California and California’s San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state Department of Public Safety announced Monday that it will scale back “proactive” investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have perplexed residents since late last year. The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation’s most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a “tongue-in-cheek way” to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold’s birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold’s legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold’s body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The First State’s roads are still some of the nation’s most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state’s number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation’s leaders. “There’s no silver bullet to solve this,” says John McNeal, chairman of the state’s Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven’t been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unsafe and filthy conditions at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority parking garages have prompted changes in how the structures are cleaned. Feces, bottles of urine, used condoms, overflowing trash and other unsanitary conditions were found at several Metrorail station garages, the transit authority’s Office of the Inspector General said in a summary of its report. The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren’t doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general’s findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for teacher raises, the eradication of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, and a new law to force girls to get their parents’ permission before getting an abortion. DeSantis said keeping taxes low, improving education and protecting the environment will help Florida continue to grow. The speech marked the opening of the Legislature’s annual 60-day session. He spoke in the House chamber, where lawmakers desks’ were covered in flowers. Members of the Supreme Court and the state’s three Cabinet members also attended the address. While touting a boost in adoption, DeSantis told lawmakers he wants them to pass a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 get their parents’ permission to get an abortion. The state already requires girls’ parents be notified if they have an abortion.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state’s coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden. A popular Honolulu bar and restaurant will close and be replaced by a new outlet of one of the nation’s biggest restaurant chains, officials say. The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state’s largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to “steal our Mai Tai intellectual property.” Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location. The Italian-American restaurant chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., is coming to Hawaii after years of television commercials running in the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nGrangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. “I’ll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it,” Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is updating its birth certificate system to affirm the gender identities of transgender parents, after a transmasculine person asked to be officially recognized as a father who gave birth to their daughter. Myles and Precious Brady-Davis of Chicago learned after their daughter, Zayn, arrived in December that the Illinois Department of Public Health automatically names the parent who gives birth as “Mother/Co-Parent” on a birth certificate. Myles Brady-Davis is transmasculine, which describes a person who was born female but is typically masculine in gender expression. Transmasculine people do not always identify as male. Myles, who uses they/them pronouns, carried and gave birth to Zayn and wants to be listed as her father, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Precious Brady-Davis is a transgender woman and the baby’s mother.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb has declared Jan. 27 “Eva Education Day” in honor of the late Eva Kor, the Holocaust survivor who dedicated much of her life to educating the world about the experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Jan. 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, were subjected to Mengele’s experiments. The Terre Haute woman’s experience was chronicled in a documentary titled “Eva: A-7063.” That film is part of an Eva Educational Toolkit that has been distributed to every middle school and high school in Indiana. Kor died July 4, 2019, while conducting her annual group tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.\n\nIowa\n\nHarlan: A man has asked a judge to let him engage in a sword fight with his ex-wife and her attorney so he can “rend their souls” from their bodies. David Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, said in a Jan. 3 court filing that his former wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, and her attorney, Matthew Hudson, had “destroyed (him) legally.” The Ostroms have been embroiled in disputes over custody and visitation issues and property tax payments. The judge had the power to let the parties “resolve our disputes on the field of battle, legally,” David Ostrom said, adding in his filing that trial by combat “has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States.” He also asked the judge for 12 weeks’ time so he could secure Japanese samurai swords. Shelby County District Court Judge Craig Dreismeier said in his own filing Monday that he won’t be issuing a decision anytime soon, citing irregularities with both sides’ motions and responses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake. Kimberly Alford says that until Jan. 6, her daughter had been a freshman at Whitefield Academy. That’s when Alford says she received an email from the academy’s head of school, Bruce Jacobson, explaining how her daughter was being expelled “immediately due to a post on social media.” Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture “demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy’s beliefs” and follows two years of “lifestyle violations.” Alford says her daughter is not gay, and the cake was simply a fun treat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The zoo in the capital city is asking for the public’s help to name its newest male giraffe. The Baton Rouge Zoo is holding a contest for people to nominate their favorite names for the facility’s latest addition, born last month. Nominations will be accepted through Jan.22. Zoo staff will take those public submissions and narrow them to three finalists, which will be up for a final vote from the public after that. The zoo will announce the finalists and more details about the voting at a later date. Six-year-old giraffe Rosie gave birth Dec. 26 to the male giraffe, the 20th giraffe to be born at the Baton Rouge Zoo.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal in the Legislature would halt a form of discrimination against people who take medication to prevent HIV infection. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland said the state’s insurance code should be amended to prevent denial of life insurance for people who take pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV. The prophylaxis is commonly called “PrEP.” The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state’s insurance code should “reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state’s largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. “The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore.” The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore’s most violent year ever on a per capita basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group working to make it legal in the state for doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses says it will continue its fight despite a recent legal setback. Compassion & Choices in its suit filed in 2016 said legalizing the practice, referred to as medical aid in dying or MAID, would help terminally ill patients avoid needless suffering. In a decision Dec. 31, a judge said the issue should be left up to lawmakers. Compassion & Choices said in a statement Monday that it intends to appeal. “This setback is disheartening, but we will continue this legal battle,” Dr. Roger Kligler, a Cape Cod physician with terminal cancer and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in the statement. Second Thoughts Massachusetts, a group that opposes medical aid in dying, praised the decision.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state’s breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about “performance-related issues” with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor’s duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn’t have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities. The department, which also runs the city’s animal control unit, estimates about 300 turkeys are currently roosting and walking in residential neighborhoods. Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department’s meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Tate Reeves was inaugurated as governor Tuesday, pledging to provide economic opportunities for all people in the state and to defend a “loving culture that underpins our quality of life.” Reeves, 45, is the 65th governor of Mississippi. He succeeds Republican Phil Bryant, who served two terms. “This will be an administration for all Mississippi,” Reeves said during his inaugural speech. Reeves served two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms before that as the elected state treasurer. He took the oath as governor before family, friends, lawmakers and other officials in the House chamber of the state Capitol. “A culture of love and kinship has knitted Mississippi families together, and tied them to each other, for ages,” Reeves said. “It is what makes us special in a fast-paced and transient world. I will defend that culture against the erosion that frays societies.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Planned Parenthood is challenging the state’s denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood’s affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri’s cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. “It’s kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance,” said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood’s attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with “loopholes” that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A campaign to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana use has submitted two proposed ballot initiatives for state review, the group New Approach Montana announced. The first ballot proposal would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults in Montana and establish a regulatory framework and a 20% sales tax. Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has prepared special Valentine’s Day offers for people who want to mark the day at a state park. Guests who reserve a cabin or lodge room – at a 30% discount – at Eugene T. Mahoney State Park between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 can add a Valentine’s Special package to their reservation. The $25 offer includes a gift package consisting of a rose, two wine glasses, sparkling juice, a 2020 Nebraskaland Calendar, chocolates and more. For a getaway at Ponca State Park, make a reservation and celebrate Birds and Breakfast, Feb. 14-15. Enjoy dinner and a 30% discount on cabin lodging on Valentine’s Day night at Platte River State Park. Or reserve a cabin at Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16 for a 30% discount. Add the Silver Package for $25 and get complimentary champagne, wine or cider; sausage and cheese platter; bouquet of flowers; cheesecake dessert; drink tickets and more.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn’t certain if the bird’s death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause “actual and substantial” damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the “and substantial” language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn’t respond when asked how he’ll handle the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The National Science Foundation has awarded two universities in the state and the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute a $5 million grant to establish a comprehensive forestry research center for the Southwest. The five-year grant will fund the development of a Center of Excellence in Forest Restoration. It will be charged with advancing the understanding of the effects of restoration activities on forested areas through a combination of multidisciplinary research and education. The center will train students in fire management as well as forest ecology and restoration, offering undergraduate and masters programs at Highlands University. Plans also include developing a collaborative Ph.D. program between Highlands and New Mexico State University.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state’s attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department’s fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James’ office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers “patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state’s coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting “more like it’s June, not January,” the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands’ forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Self-driving shuttles will do a circuit through a residential neighborhood in the capital city as part of a yearlong pilot program starting in late January. Three 12-passenger, disabled-accessible electric shuttles will travel the 2.8-mile route in the Linden neighborhood. The shuttles, which are autonomous but monitored by on-board operators, will run between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m and connect riders to locations with social services like St. Stephen’s Community House, which has a food pantry and health and job resources. Other stops include a recreation center and a transit center. The circuit will be timed so riders can connect to Central Ohio Transit Authority buses. The route will be suspended for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon as a precaution because of students walking to school, says Mandy Bishop, the program manager for Smart Columbus, the city’s mobility initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has adopted a new electronic tracking system that will allow sexual assault survivors to monitor the location and status of their rape kits. The purpose of the system is to empower survivors with information, help law enforcement with investigations, and foster transparency and public trust, The Oklahoman reports. Only survivors and entities that update the system can access the records. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation operates the system, which was authorized through legislation passed last year. A task force made recommendations in an effort to improve the state’s response to sexual assaults. “I’m hoping it will hold all of us accountable to make sure that we don’t let victims fall through the cracks,” says Andrea Fielding, division director of criminalistics for the OSBI.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has voted unanimously to draft an emergency declaration legally allowing car camping in certain areas. Many members of the public who spoke at the council meeting Monday supported the push for car camping but stressed more needed to be done to help the homeless population. Most demanded immediate action. Mayor Chuck Bennett said he was “deeply concerned” about the homeless crisis, but it has been 30 years in the making, and officials are working to fight that crisis in a matter of weeks. He said the actions made during Monday’s session will help meet the needs of the community. A study researching the option found the city has neither the funds nor the resources to manage a city-sponsored program. A privately sponsored program – where site owners provide supervision, trash receptacles and access to bathrooms – was suggested as an alternative.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s second lady, Giselle Fetterman, will help lead a campaign to raise awareness of this year’s census and encourage residents to respond, state officials said Monday. Fetterman, whose husband is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, said she will tour the state, making stops in Philadelphia and in Centre, Erie, Allegheny, Lancaster and Luzerne counties over the next three months. Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state’s main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker’s compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn’t fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Mayor Knox White says he’s found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he’s still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It’s the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nElk Point: A school district will pay $65,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by a former honor student. Addison Ludwig says she was singled out by the former Elk Point-Jefferson High School principal after she was featured in the student newspaper in 2017 and described a hobby as “Netflix n’ Chill with my boyfriend.” Ludwig says she didn’t know it was a term some use to describe casual sexual encounters until the principal, Travis Aslesen, made her look it up on the internet. Aslesen revoked her senior privileges and honors study hall and removed her as editor of the newspaper. Ludwig in her lawsuit said male students who used the term had not been disciplined, including a boy who had used the term in a profile in the newspaper earlier in the year, the lawsuit said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Senate started the 2020 legislative session passing its first bill of the year: a controversial measure that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would “violate the agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies.” It also prohibits the state from denying an agency’s license or grant application for public funds because of the group’s refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.\n\nTexas\n\nStephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University’s Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow’s eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. “We have two Fitbits on every cow,” Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah’s total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state’s largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county’s total population grew by 10,000 people.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill has been proposed in the Legislature to decriminalize adult prostitution. The legislation is co-sponsored by four female legislators. Rep. Selene Colburn, a Burlington progressive, said she thinks decriminalizing sex work will improve safety and health of prostitutes, mynbc5.com reports. “The underlying question is do we need to criminalize consensual sex between adults on any terms?” she said. Sex trafficking, exploitation and solicitation of minors will remain a serious felony, she said. The bill is in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure’s future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. “Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we’re more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals,” Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a sponsor of the House resolution, said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle Police Department’s civilian watchdog has found that an officer’s ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver’s suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect’s friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver’s friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Rescue dogs could soon become the state’s official state dog under a proposal approved Tuesday in the Senate. The resolution, sponsored by state Sens. Ryan Weld and Stephen Baldwin, says it seeks to bring attention to dogs living in the more than 500 animal shelters in West Virginia. “Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with the dog,” said Weld, a Republican. “That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be.” The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates. West Virginia already has a bunch of official state flora and fauna. The black bear is the state animal, the sugar maple is the state tree, the cardinal is the state bird, and the rhododendron is the state flower.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans are introducing a package of bills that would impose tougher sanctions and sentences on criminals. The legislation would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person’s extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from finishing probation early; and block violent criminals from participating in early release programs. The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/trump-policy-speech/index.html", "title": "There is no such thing as a Donald Trump policy speech | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time since January 2021, Donald Trump returned to Washington on Tuesday to deliver a speech at a summit hosted by the America First Policy Institute.\n\nCoverage in the run-up to the address focused on how it would be policy-heavy, laying out Trump’s vision for America (and, presumably, setting the stage for him to run for president again in 2024).\n\n“What I’d ask you to do is to lay out a hopeful agenda for America. Tell us how we can make chips without spending all this money. Tell us how we can be safer, you don’t have to worry about your kids as much as you do today,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in remarks at the AFPI conference in advance of Trump’s speech. “You did it once, you can do it again.”\n\nWhich, well, let me just stop you there.\n\nThe notion being put forward by Graham, that Trump has a) given a serious policy address and b) painted a “hopeful” vision for America is simply false.\n\nGo back to Trump’s two most famous/infamous speeches: The one to kickoff his 2016 presidential campaign and the one he delivered at his 2017 inauguration.\n\nThe first is defined in the public’s mind by Trump’s insistence that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\n\n(In that same speech, Trump blasted his opponents for their lack of understanding about air conditioning, bragged about his crowd size and called the US as a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.”)\n\nHopeful!\n\nThen there was Trump’s inauguration speech, which is remembered for Trump’s evocation of “American carnage” in describing the current state of the country.\n\nUplifting!\n\nThe simple fact is that Trump’s appeal has NEVER been about policies or a hopeful vision. It’s always been totally and completely about Trump himself – and the roiling sense of grievance, nostalgia and score-settling that sits at the center of his personality.\n\nSure, there have been issues that embodied that sentiment. Trump voters rallied behind his call to build a border wall – and make Mexico pay for it – because it sounded tough and freaked out liberal elites. His foreign policy stances appealed to voters who wanted America to go back to the take-no-prisoners approach they remembered from decades ago. (That such an American foreign policy stance never existed was besides the point for these folks.)\n\nTrump’s ever-shifting views on, well, most things, was the clearest evidence that his winning campaign – and the four years he spent in the White House — weren’t about advancing some broader theory of the case. They were about Trump doing whatever felt good at the moment – and the cult of personality that grew up around his many maneuvers. (In 2017, the New Yorker wrote a great piece about conservative intellectuals who tried to put an ideological framework around Trumpism. Which, well, ha!)\n\nNow to Trump’s speech on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the country was “on the brink” and the weakest that it has been since the Civil War. (Trump cited Newt Gingrich as the authority on that second claim.) He said we have “very little” public safety. He said that there is an “invasion” of immigrants coming into the country. He said, “Our streets are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.” He decried “drugged-out lunatics” and “sadists” who he insisted are taking over the country. “Our country is now a cesspool of crime,” said Trump.\n\nHis policy solution? “It has to stop and it has to stop now.”\n\nWhich, well, color me unsurprised.\n\nThe Point: The appeal of Trump to voters has never, ever been about a policy or a set of policies.

Once there, they were confronted not only by mountains of undelivered mail but by racism and sexism. They were denied entry into an American Red Cross club and hotels, according to the history, and a senior officer was threatened with being being replaced by a white first lieutenant when some unit members missed an inspection. Working under the motto of “No Mail, Low Morale,” the women served 24/7 in shifts and developed a new tracking system that processed about 65,000 items each shift, allowing them to clear a six-month backlog of mail in just three months. The medals themselves won’t be ready for months, but leaders decided to go ahead with events for Davis and five other surviving members of the 6888th given their advanced age.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: A male brown bear going through trash was killed by authorities in a city that experienced a record number of bear incidents last year. The weekend shooting of the bear by Sitka police was the first this year in the southeast Alaska city, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Last year, 14 bears were killed in and around Sitka, which the newspaper reported was a record for the community. Steve Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said four shots were fired, at least two of which hit the bear. Police received a call about a bear at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday. By the time Bethune arrived about 1 a.m. Sunday, officers had killed the animal, he said. Police later Sunday issued citations at three addresses for having bear attractants. Bethune estimated the bear was 8 to 12 years old and otherwise healthy.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Supreme Court denied a request from the Cyber Ninjas, a company that oversaw a partisan Arizona election review, to reject a daily $50,000 penalty for refusing to hand over records related to the state Senate’s ballot review. The court also denied Cyber Ninjas’ request to find the records are not public documents. It was the second time they had made that request to the high court, and the second time the court rejected it this year. The court’s brief order means the fines continue, as the Ninjas’ owner have been slow to comply with a court order that its records related to last year’s ballot review are public documents. The court also denied a request from The Arizona Republic for attorney fees in its appeal to the high court. The decision does not affect a pending request for fees in the ongoing fight in the lower court. The Republic is suing Cyber Ninjas and its owners, Doug and Meghan Logan, arguing records the company has that are related to the state Senate-ordered ballot review of the 2020 Maricopa County election results are public records. The lawsuit also extends to the Senate, but it was not a party to the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A fire at a northwestern Arkansas home killed six people, including four children, authorities said. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said Monday the fire happened early Sunday at a trailer home in Springdale, about 145 miles northwest of Little Rock. Emergency responders received a call at about 2 a.m. about a fire and that people were still inside the home, the sheriff’s office said. One child was able to escape. Detectives are investigating the cause of the blaze. The victims’ bodies have been sent to the state crime lab to determine cause of death. The sheriff’s office did not release names or ages of the victims. Television station KNWA reported the Springdale School District said the victims included students enrolled in the district.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Tap water used by more than 900,000 Californians is unsafe to drink and the state isn’t acting fast enough to help clean it up, state auditors said in a report. Thousands of water systems supply the state’s 39 million people, and about 5% of them have some type of contaminant, such as nitrates or arsenic, in them, according to the audit. That means people can’t safely drink the water or use it to cook or bathe. Most of the 370 failing systems are in economically disadvantaged communities, many in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural heartland. The State Water Resources Control Board has provided at least $1.7 billion in grants since 2016 for design and construction to improve water systems. That could include building new treatment plants, consolidating water systems or other actions designed to improve water quality. But it took the board 33 months on average in 2021 for water system operators to complete the application process and receive money, the audit found – nearly double the time it took in 2017. The audit found a lack of clear metrics and poor communication created confusion for water districts seeking help and slowed down the award process. Eileen Sobeck, executive director for the water board, told state auditors the board agrees the process could be clearer and faster. But she disagreed with the conclusion the board hasn’t acted with urgency to improve contaminated water systems, saying the board’s “highest priority is advancing the human right to water.” California made a right to safe drinking water state law in 2013. The water board has previously said it would need $4.5 billion to address all the needs through 2025.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two Republicans who suggested their losses in last month’s GOP primaries in Colorado might be the result of fraud filed their second round of requests for recounts Tuesday. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters and state Rep. Ron Hanks echoed former President Donald Trump’s claims about the 2020 election during their own races for their party’s nomination for Secretary of State and U.S. Senate, respectively. After they each lost by more than 40,000 votes, they requested a hand recount. The Colorado Secretary of State’s office said their regulations required any recounts to be done by machine and that it would cost $236,000. When the candidates didn’t pay, it proceeded with certification of their losses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Max Reiss, the face of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration for the past three years, said he is leaving next month to take a new position in the private sector. Reiss, 36, will become a senior vice president at M&T Bank, which recently completed the acquisition of Connecticut-based People’s United Financial, Inc. and will now have a presence in 12 states. Lamont praised his departing communications director, a former TV reporter who previously covered the Democratic administration for WVIT-TV, for his dedication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reiss managed much of the state’s public outreach efforts and became a familiar voice for residents who tuned in daily for Lamont’s pandemic news conferences. Reiss previously worked as a TV and radio reporter in Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere. His final day as Lamont’s chief spokesperson is Aug. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Town Council voted to give $24,750 to the Georgetown Historical Society, a nonprofit that allows a Confederate flag to be flown on its property. Councilwomen Angela Townsend made a motion to approve granting the funds, and the other council members all voted in favor of it. Mayor Bill West did not vote. Townsend’s motion stipulated “a committee would be formed to address the concerns,” but did not specify details. The Georgetown Historical Society’s Marvel Museum is home to numerous buildings, a collection of antique carriages and items related to Georgetown’s history. The grounds and buildings are often used for public and private events, as well. The Delaware Grays Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp #2068 reached an agreement with the society in 2007, allowing them to install and maintain the flag and a monument to Delawareans who fought for the Confederacy. It was only 15 years ago, but it was a decidedly different time, one in which then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner celebrated the installation by declaring a statewide “Confederate History and Heritage Week.” By 2017, the Lower Sussex NAACP was calling for the removal of the flag. In 2019, the state declined to provide funding to the Georgetown Historical Society because of the flag.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police said they found a woman for which they were searching after confirming their investigation into an armed kidnapping in Northwest D.C. on Wednesday morning. Lt. McHauly Murphy with the MPD's Second District originally announced police were looking for 30-year-old Selita Lee. Police said they believe she was kidnapped by her boyfriend, Marquez \"Mikko\" Antonio Parker, 44, for whom they are still searching. Parker is described by police as about 5-foot-8 and 140 pounds, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, light blue pants and white shoes. Police said he was carrying a black satchel and is armed with a black handgun. Anyone with information about this case should contact police by dialing 911, texting the department's tip line at 50411 or calling (202) 727-9099.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s population grew slightly over a previous forecast in the first quarter of this year, but slowing growth with deaths outpacing births is still in the Sunshine State’s future over the next decade, according to estimates released last week. The estimates released by the state Demographic Estimating Conference showed that Florida’s population growth appears to have peaked last year with a 1.6% rate. Florida’s population in 2022 will stand at more than 22 million residents, trailing only California and Texas in size. The April 1 estimate was 3,795 residents higher than a forecast in December, reflecting an increase in migration. Although Florida will continue to grow over the next decade and beyond, with its population reaching just short of 25 million residents by 2032, it’s pace of growth will slow to 0.8% in 10 years and 0.6% by 2039, according to the estimates.\n\nGeorgia\n\nReidsville: A judge has been arrested on charges he threatened a man who confronted the jurist about taking vegetables from his garden. Tattnall County Chief Magistrate Judge Eddie Anderson, 70, was charged Monday with felony counts of making a terrorist threat and violating his oath of office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. He was booked at the county jail and released on his own recognizance. The GBI said a man reported to the county sheriff he believed the judge had come onto his property and taken vegetables without permission. The man told authorities Anderson threatened him with violence when confronted during a phone call. Witnesses overheard the judge making the threat, the GBI said. Anderson did not immediately respond to an a phone message left at his office or an email seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man accused of using counterfeit bank checks totaling $1.2 million to bail three people out of a jail has been arrested and ordered held without bail, according to court records. Samuela Tuikolongahau Jr. was detained by federal authorities on Monday. A U.S. Secret Service affidavit filed in court alleged he presented the bank checks for $760,000, $400,000 and $50,000 in 2020 during the attempt to post bail for three people held at the Oahu Community Correctional Center. He left a Honolulu courthouse after being told the checks would need verification, the court document said. Officials determined the checks were counterfeit and the two men and woman he tried to get out of jail were not released. Court documents did not specify his relationship to the three jailed people. Tuikolongahau appeared in federal court Tuesday for a hearing, where a judge appointed defense attorney Walter Rodby to represent him. Tuikolongahau consented to be detained without bail as prosecutors requested, according to court records. Rodby did not immediately return email and phone messages seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 800 wildland firefighters and support staff are fighting a blaze in east-central Idaho that officials said is threatening homes, an important north-south corridor, energy infrastructure, recreation opportunities and the municipal watershed for the town of Salmon. The Moose Fire on Tuesday grew to nearly 60 square miles burning grass, timber understory and dead and down material in the Salmon-Challis National Forest. It’s only 10% contained. Firefighters are protecting structures in several areas, as well as the U.S. Highway 93 corridor, a major north-south route. Two helicopter pilots fighting the fire died last week when their CH-47D Series “Chinook” crashed in the Salmon River. Plans call for removing the helicopter from the river with a large crane. The cause of the fire that started July 17 is unknown. High temperatures and dry relative humidity are hampering efforts to control the blaze. Smoke has also been a problem.\n\nIllinois\n\nNorthbrook: A coyote on public display in suburban Chicago will get a larger den but not a transfer to a wild animal sanctuary in Colorado. A report for the Cook County Forest Preserve District said the coyote, named Rocky, is “happy and healthy” in his 266-square-foot home but will get more room. Critics, however, said his constant pacing is proof that he’s bored. “You put an animal in a cage they’re not happy,” said Jodie Wiederkehr, director of the Chicago Alliance for Animals. Rocky has been at the River Trail Nature Center in Northbrook since 2018, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He was found as a pup in Tennessee. An expanded habitat is in the works at the nature center. A petition to relocate the coyote to a wild animal sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado, has more than 6,000 signatures. “Because the coyote is an imprinted animal that has lived with humans practically since birth, there is no guarantee it will thrive if moved across the country and introduced to other coyotes,” Forest Preserve officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers on Tuesday narrowly advanced a plan to ban nearly all abortions in the state, despite opposition from abortion-rights supporters, who said the bill goes too far, and anti-abortion activists, who said it doesn’t go far enough. Indiana has one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling — a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. In Indiana, chants from anti-abortion activists, such as “Let their heart beat,” could be heard inside the Senate chamber as a committee wrapped up two days of testimony during which none of the more than 60 people speaking voiced support for the Republican-sponsored bill. The committee voted 7-5 in favor of the ban after also adding provisions under which doctors could face felony criminal charges and up to six years in prison for performing an illegal abortion. That’s the same potential penalty for performing abortions under Indiana’s current 20-week ban. More amendments to the bill could be debated by the full Senate on Thursday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The butter cow at the Iowa State Fair, which runs Aug. 11-21, will be showcased with a companion piece – a tribute to “The Music Man,” the Broadway musical written by Mason City native Meredith Willson in 1957. The musical based on the fictional town of River City, Iowa, celebrates its 60th year in film with a Broadway reboot that stars Hugh Jackman, who plays traveling salesman Harold Hill trying to sell a town of Iowans musical instruments and uniforms to start a band. Officials promised at least one of the 76 trombones from the musical’s centerpiece song to make an appearance. The 600-pound butter cow will have another companion piece, a relief that celebrates the 100th anniversary of Ye Old Mill. The 1,500-foot canal ride was first constructed in 1921. Couples like to float on the boats and many a couple shared a first kiss or proposed on the ride. In 1996, a strong wind blew down the mill, but a $100,000 gift from Boatmen’s Bank of Iowa helped the ride return for the State Fair that year. The butter cow became a regular fixture at the State Fair in 1911. The fair added a companion sculpture in 1996 that featured Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.” Through the years, sculptures of Harry Potter, Garth Brooks, the 25th anniversary of “Field of Dreams,” Superman and gymnast Shawn Johnson were featured.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Early voting is surging in Kansas ahead of next week’s statewide abortion vote. More than 2½ times as many people cast early ballots as of Tuesday compared to the same point in the 2018 midterm primary, the Kansas secretary of state’s office reported. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to amend the state Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. The Kansas vote is the first statewide referendum on abortion policy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June. The Republican-controlled Legislature put the anti-abortion measure on the ballot to overturn a 2019 state Supreme Court decision declaring access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state constitution. The measure would add language saying the state constitution does not grant a right to abortion, allowing lawmakers to regulate it as they see fit.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has awarded a license for a new facility with plans to offer quarter horse racing in the state. Revolutionary Racing will build in Ashland and feature an American quarter horse “sprint racing” track and a historical horse racing facility, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Tuesday. Historical racing machines allow people to bet on randomly generated horse races from the past. The games typically show video of condensed horse races. Revolutionary Racing obtained the last available racing license in Kentucky, according to state officials. The project invests $55 million and creates 200 jobs, Beshear said. The construction project is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Jury deliberations resumed Wednesday in the federal trial of New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams, who was elected to be the city’s top prosecutor in December 2020 despite having been indicted months earlier on tax charges. Williams and Nicole Burdett, who was an attorney in his law practice, were accused in an indictment of conspiring to cheat on Williams’ taxes during a five-year period ending in 2017. Prosecutors said Williams’ tax burden was illegally cut by $200,000. Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday morning, a week after the trial began. Prosecution witnesses included the tax preparer, Henry Timothy, who was cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to a single tax charge. The defense rested Tuesday morning as well, without calling witnesses. Williams has long contended the prosecution was politically motivated. Defense attorneys have portrayed Timothy as a fraud while attacking his credibility, and questioned why others whose taxes were prepared by Timothy weren’t criminally prosecuted.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills increased her fundraising advantage over Republican challenger Paul LePage in the latest reporting period, hauling in $605,000 during the 42-day period, according to documents filed Tuesday. The report that covers the period from June 1 to July 19 lifted Mills’ fundraising haul to $3.8 million, with $2.7 million in cash on hand, according to the campaign disclosure reports. LePage, a former two-term governor, raised about $312,000 for the same period, bringing his total to nearly $1.8 million, the reports said. The race is one of several gubernatorial contests that will be on the national radar during the 2022 midterm elections. LePage is seeking to become the first governor to serve three, four-year terms. LePage served consecutive terms, but Maine allows a former governor to serve again after sitting out an election.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:The Washington County Democratic Central Committee is expected to open its headquarters in downtown Hagerstown. An orientation was held Saturday by the county Democratic Central Committee, where volunteers received information on how to educate, support and encourage people to vote for Democratic candidates during the general election Nov. 8.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation to ban discrimination based on natural and protective hairstyles – such as Afros, cornrows or tightly coiled twists – in workplaces, school districts and school-related organizations in Massachusetts was signed into law Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Black women in particular have faced pressure in school and on the job to alter their hair to conform to policies that are biased against natural hairstyles, according to supporters of the law. The bill had been unanimously approved by the Democrat-controlled House and Senate. The new law defines natural and protective hairstyles as including “braids, locks, twists, Bantu knots and other formations,” and tasks the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination with enforcing the protections. Policies that limit or prohibit natural hairstyles in all school districts are now banned. The law also prohibits hair discrimination in employment, business, advertising and public spaces. Massachusetts is the 18th state to adopt a version of the the bill – known as the Crown Act – into law, legislators said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thousands who were wrongly accused of fraud when seeking unemployment benefits can seek financial relief from the state, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, breaking new ground when someone claims their constitutional rights have been violated by the government. “The state is prohibited from violating the rights the Constitution guarantees. If it does so, it is liable for the harm it causes,” Justice Megan Cavanagh wrote in a 4-3 opinion.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has voted to remove a decades-old requirement that members have a minimum of 25% Chippewa blood. Officials said 65% of voters on an advisory referendum said the blood quantum requirement should be removed from membership in the six-reservation tribe. The referendum is a guide for tribal leaders who will now decide whether to ask voters to amend the tribe’s constitution. The majority of voters said each reservation – Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, Bois Forte, Grand Portage, White Earth and Leech Lake – should be allowed to determine its own enrollment requirements, the Star Tribune reported. The blood quantum requirement has caused the tribe’s enrollment to shrink, with many children not considered members despite having a parent who is. About 15% of the tribe’s roughly 39,000 citizens are under age 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is moving forward with creating an office for violence prevention and trauma recovery that was announced in early May, said Safiya R. Omari, the city’s chief of staff. The National League of Cities and Wells Fargo Bank awarded the city a $700,000 grant in May to create the office. In addition, the city will hire an executive director and policy analyst with public safety experience, while seeking additional funds for the prevention office, Omari said. “Students from local colleges will have the opportunity to serve as interns to broaden the community-based interventions towards violence prevention,” Omari said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Federal investigators said a Springfield man robbed a bank last week after writing a demand note in pink highlighter on the back of his birth certificate and handing it to the teller. On July 20, at about 11:30 a.m., court documents showed a 29-year-old man wearing a cut-off gray T-shirt, blue gym shorts and one orange shoe, entered the Bank of America on West Kearney Street and handed a teller a note reading “Give me your money now. Don’t say anything. I have a partner outside.” The teller emptied the cash drawer and handed the man the money and the note, at which time the man left and fled the scene in a black pickup truck, according to court documents. The man was arrested later that day because of a tip. The man allegedly confessed to the crime and told investigators he robbed the bank to “prove a point” to his girlfriend after they got into an argument. He told investigators that he didn’t know which bank he was going to rob, but drove by the Bank of America and decided it would be that one. According to court documents, the man told law enforcement he wrote the note on the back of his birth certificate in pink highlighter and after fleeing the scene, he threw his birth certificate and ID out the car window. The man is charged with one count of bank robbery, a federal crime that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A 79-year-old Florida man died in a fall in Glacier National Park while he was trying to scramble up an off-trail slope with a group of friends, park officials said Tuesday. The incident happened Monday morning on Rising Wolf Mountain, several hundred feet above the Two Medicine Campground in the southeastern part of the park, spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The friends descended to the victim’s location, yelled to the campground for help and called 911. National Park Service staff responded. A search helicopter operated by Two Bear Air, which had been working to recover the bodies of two men who died in a climbing accident several days earlier, was temporarily diverted to help with the rescue. The helicopter transported the unconscious man to the Two Medicine Ranger Station, where an air ambulance was waiting. The air ambulance crew declared the man dead, authorities said. The man’s name and hometown were being withheld until family members could be notified. The bodies of the two 67-year-old Montana men who died in a fall on Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s interior were also recovered Monday, Kerzman said. Brian McKenzie Kennedy of Columbia Falls and Jack Dewayne Beard of Kalispell were expert climbers who had been summitting mountain peaks in Glacier park for decades, park officials said in releasing their names Tuesday. Both were members of the Glacier Mountaineering Society, the park said in a statement. The men set out for a climb on July 22 and were to return the next day. They were reported missing July 24 and their bodies were spotted from a search helicopter Monday morning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: President Joe Biden approved a request for a federal disaster declaration for a portion of Nebraska that suffered damage from severe storms and straight-line winds in May. The designation allows state, local and tribal governments and some private nonprofit organizations to access federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and for the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The declaration covers 20 counties from central to northeastern Nebraska. The counties included in the declaration are Antelope, Boone, Burt, Cedar, Cuming, Custer, Dixon, Garfield, Greeley, Holt, Knox, Logan, Pierce, Polk, Sherman, Thurston, Valley, Wayne, Wheeler, and York. A line of severe storms that moved through the eastern half of the state on May 12 generated straight-line winds of up to 100 mph in some places, the National Weather Services reported, downing power lines, poles and trees and damaging buildings.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Another body has surfaced at Lake Mead – this time in a swimming area where water levels have dropped as the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam recedes because of drought. The National Park Service did not say in a statement how long officials believe the corpse was submerged in the Boulder Beach area before it was found Monday by people who summoned park rangers. Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse said Tuesday it was partially encased in mud at the water line of the swimming area along the shore north of Hemenway Harbor marina. The gender of the dead person was not immediately apparent, Rouse said, and it was too early to tell a time, cause and manner of death. Investigators will review missing persons records as part of the effort, Rouse said. The corpse was the third found since May as the shoreline retreats at the shrinking reservoir between Nevada and Arizona east of Las Vegas. The lake surface has dropped more than 170 feet since the reservoir was full in 1983. It is now about 30% full. The coroner said her office was continuing work to identify a man whose body was found May 1 in a rusted barrel in the Hemenway Harbor area and a man whose bones were found May 7 in a newly surfaced sand bar near Callville Bay, more than 9 miles from the marina. On July 6, the body of a 22-year-old Boulder City woman was found in the water near where she disappeared while riding a personal watercraft. Rouse said it might take several weeks to determine her cause of death. The case of the body in the barrel was being investigated as a homicide after police said the man had been shot and his clothing dated to the mid-1970s to early 1980s.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: The state Executive Council – which approves nominations and state contracts – voted 4-1 to deny funding to the Equality Health Center, Lovering Health Center and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. The contracts, which were supported by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, would have funded cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception and other routine health care services for more than 16,000 low-income women. The outcome was the same when the council voted in September, December and January. Wednesday was the first vote since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. Republican councilors previously raised concerns that public money would pay for abortions and continued to vote no even after audit reports confirmed that funds were not commingled.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Hospitalized patients in New Jersey who have tested positive for the coronavirus have surpassed 1,000 again for the first time since February and most of the state is back to seeing high rates of transmission as a new mutation continues to spread quickly, data from the state Department of Health shows. But administrators at some of the state’s largest hospital networks said most patients have relatively mild symptoms and are being sent home with medication. The latest surge is being driven by the omicron BA.5 subvariant, which makes up about 82% of all positive cases in New Jersey and New York – up from 64% less than two weeks ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gun-safety advocates said police, prosecutors and judges are still learning how to harness a 2020 red-flag law that can be used to seize guns from people who pose a danger to others or themselves. Shiela Lewis offers training to police, prosecutors and school administrators on how to petition a judge for a red-flag order to temporarily seize guns for a one-year period that can be extended. She told a panel of state legislators Tuesday that an incomplete understanding of the current law is limiting its use as a precaution against gun violence. Just nine petitions have been filed to have guns removed since New Mexico’s red-flag law went into effect in May 2020. The state Department of Health said it plans to begin soliciting grants aimed at preventing gun violence, starting in August.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A jury was asked Tuesday to consider whether a neurologist used his thriving pain-management practice to sexually prey on six patients or if he is a victim of accusers with false stories. The case against Dr. Ricardo Cruciani relied on “survivor stories of six very different women,” assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said in closing arguments at Cruciani’s trial. “This is a trial about a doctor who raped, sodomized, hugged and manipulated his patients,” Lucey said. The prosecutor argued the evidence showed Cruciani groomed patients by overprescribing pain killers, sometimes to treat serious injuries from car wrecks and other accidents. The accusers testified the sexual abuse often occurred behind closed doors during appointments in 2013 at a Manhattan medical center, where the doctor would expose himself and demand sex. Defense attorney Fred Sosinsky countered by arguing the witnesses were unreliable, telling jurors, “You should have every reason to doubt these accusations.” He added that the witnesses “were willing to lie” and “dispute the indisputable.” Cruciani, 68, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including rape, sexual abuse and predatory sexual assault. The jury worked for about an hour late Tuesday without reaching a verdict. It was to resume deliberations Wednesday morning.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Mayor Vi Lyles won a third term Tuesday as the Democrat defeated Republican rival Stephanie de Sarachaga-Bilbao by a more than 2-to-1 margin, according to unofficial results. In Greensboro, the state’s third-largest city, Mayor Nancy Vaughan led challenger Justin Outling by more than 400 votes in the officially nonpartisan race. The News & Record of Greensboro reported that Outling, a city councilmember, declined to concede late Tuesday, saying he wanted to wait for other votes to be counted. There are an unknown number of provisional and mail-in absentee ballots outstanding. About 15% of the mayoral votes counted by Tuesday were for write-in candidates. Meanwhile, Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker lost handily to former deputy Willie Rowe in a runoff for the Democratic nomination. Rowe will now take on Republican Donnie Harrison – a former sheriff – in the November election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s only abortion clinic was preparing for what could be its final day of performing procedures, with a trigger ban set to take effect Thursday that will likely force patients to travel hundreds of miles to receive care pending the clinic’s relocation across the border to Minnesota. Barring a judge’s intervention, the Red River Women’s Clinic will provide abortion services Wednesday and then shut down. Owner Tammi Kromenaker is building a clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota, with the aid of nearly $1 million raised through GoFundMe. Kromenaker has not said when the new clinic will open and she did not respond to messages Tuesday. Planned Parenthood has said it can perform abortions at its own Moorhead facility to fill the gap if needed, but it is not known if that will happen. Once North Dakota’s ban takes effect, the nearest abortion clinics will be in Minneapolis and Duluth, a drive of about 4 hours from Fargo, and in Billings, Montana, which is nearly 4 hours from North Dakota’s western border.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio man who admitted threatening a witness after posting videos from the U.S. Capitol riots was sentenced Wednesday to two years of probation. Justin Stoll of Wilmington pleaded guilty in January in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati to transmitting a threat to injure. Authorities alleged Stoll breached the security barricades at the Capitol but did not enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021. According to court documents, Stoll attended the rally and went with other rioters past police barricades that had been torn down. He recorded videos showing this and posted them online. When one online viewer said they saved his video, Stoll warned if the viewer took action to “ever jeopardize me, from being with my family,” then the person would meet his or her “maker,” and that he would be the one to “arrange the meeting.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Crews are expected to break ground this fall for a new fairgrounds coliseum to replace “The Big House,” which opened in 1965 and helped the OKC Fairgrounds become known as “The Horse Show Capital of the World.” The new coliseum will be constructed for just over $102 million. Rising construction costs and inflation made the price tag much more than when a City Council memo in November 2020 estimated the cost at $73 million. Although a small portion of the Jim Norick arena will be demolished to make room for the coliseum, the arena will be fully operational during all phases of construction, fairgrounds spokesman Scott Munz said. The current fairgrounds arena has the largest economic impact of all publicly owned facilities in Oklahoma City, holding more than 250 event days a year, including international equine and livestock shows, concerts, sporting events and ice shows.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A man who reportedly ignited wildfires in a remote, forested corner of Oregon was apprehended by three local residents and tied to a tree until police arrived, a sheriff said Tuesday. Federal, state and county authorities responded to a radio call Monday from a U.S. Bureau of Land Management employee who reported a man was walking along a gravel road and setting fires in a forest about 25 miles northwest of Grants Pass. Ground crews, assisted by local residents, and three helicopters quickly got the two fires under control, Curry County Sheriff John Ward said. Meanwhile, three local residents located the suspect walking on the road near the fires and detained him. After being treated at a hospital for his injuries, Trennon Smith, 30, of Veneta, Oregon, was being held on Tuesday in the Curry County jail on charges of arson and reckless burning, Ward said. Court documents did not say if he has an attorney. Bond was set at $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A decision about whether the method of funding public education meets a state constitutional requirement was left in the hands of a state judge Tuesday when argument wrapped up in the long-running case. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not indicate when she will rule but said attorneys left her with a massive record to review. The case could result in substantial changes, as the plaintiffs are challenging whether the amounts and method of distribution of the annual education subsidies issued by the General Assembly comport with the state Constitution. The defendants, Republican leaders in the state House and Senate, argued funding has been growing and is adequate. State education funding was boosted in the budget that passed earlier this month and has increased by billions of dollars during Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s nearly eight years in office.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza said there would be no infringement of civil liberties with the deployment of the city’s license plate reading cameras despite concerns over a lack of public input. Although the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the cameras, designed by Atlanta company Flock Safety, and opposes the expansion of surveillance efforts, Elorza said “concerns about civil liberties being compromised will not materialize.” “I just urge everybody to have an open mind,” said City Council President John Igliozzi, who contended the cameras are essential to creating “a safe and secure environment to live in.” Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré said the cameras likely will be activated within the next 30 days. Paré said the policy governing the use of the cameras, which was distributed to reporters, was crafted over the course of 60 days. Flock is giving Providence 25 cameras at no cost for a one-year trial. The program did not receive any approval from the City Council, apparently because it did not need to be factored into the city’s budget.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette made history on Wednesday as the first gubernatorial ticket to file for reelection in South Carolina. This fall is only the second time voters will elect a governor and lieutenant governor together. Before 2018, lieutenant governors were elected separately. “We’ve had great success in the last four years,” McMaster told reporters after Evette signed her campaign paperwork. “She is fully conversant with the trials, tribulations and challenges of business. … I think that we offer a good, strong team that’s fully committed to the great people of South Carolina.” In 2018, as he sought his first full term, McMaster became the first governor to run on the same ticket as his pick for lieutenant governor. At the time, Evette was a political newcomer, a Greenville businesswoman McMaster said he picked in part because of her “fresh eyes” when it came to governing, as well as her relationships with the business community. Over the past four years, Evette has spent many months traveling the state, meeting with companies and businesses, as well as promoting relationships between South Carolina’s technical training schools, the strength of which both she and the governor have argued is key to the state’s growing manufacturing economy. In November, McMaster will face Democrat Joe Cunningham, a former one-term congressman. Cunningham has said he will announce his pick for a running mate next week. No Democrat has captured South Carolina’s top job in 20 years, and Republicans have held all statewide-elected offices for more than a decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A stalk of corn is growing in front of a home – in the concrete – at the 5700 block of W. Silver Valley Drive near Dunham Park on the city’s west side. It’s the second report of corn growing in unexpected places this week after a corn plant was found by a golfer at the Elmwood Gold Course on Monday in a sand bunker. Both plants were photographed and shared by separate people on the Sioux Falls Reddit page to the delight of others ready to relive what some consider the most positive story of 2020 in the city. In 2020, the 57th Street Corn became the talk of the town, inspiring T-shirts, memes and photos from fans across the region. The corn was later found pulled from the ground near the intersection at 57th Street and Minnesota Avenue. The Silver Valley Drive Corn is still a young plant, but Ldyia Smith, the owner of the house in front of the plant, said it’s in good hands. “I said that we could start serving street corn once it started growing,” Smith said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A Black repertory theater said it plans to open a tuition-free school for at-risk students and other groups in a historic church that will be renovated after falling into disrepair. Hattiloo Theatre said the new program is expected to begin in late 2023. Students will be accepted based on auditions, and two-thirds of admissions will be reserved for low-income and marginalized students, the theater said Tuesday. Hattiloo Theater School will hold free audition workshops in at-risk neighborhoods. Programs will include youth courses based on experience level and age, a diverse abilities course and a senior citizen course, the theater said. The school will be housed in the Third Presbyterian Church, built in 1860. A community redevelopment agency plans to fund renovations. The church served as a hospital for federal Civil War troops, and it has changed names and congregations over the years, the theater said.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The building housing one of the city’s oldest grocery stores will be remade into medical offices anchored by El Paso Children’s Hospital doctors’ offices and possibly a clinic. The Food City building at 5400 Alameda Ave. was sold June 30 by the grocery store owners to an El Paso developer for an undisclosed amount. The 50-year-old store is expected to close about Aug 10, a Food City official said. The building and the 5 acres it stands on are valued for tax purposes at $3.7 million by the El Paso Central Appraisal District. Food City officials notified the Texas Workforce Commission that it would lay off 90 people by Sept. 3. However, that number is now about 55 because some employees were placed at Food City’s two other El Paso stores, Carlos Loweree, Food City vice president, said Tuesday. El Paso Children’s Hospital officials in a statement said the hospital is leasing a portion of the Food City building because it needs more office space for doctors as it continues to employ more physician specialists.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Miniature bottles of alcohol could return to liquor stores in deeply religious Utah by the fall after the state agency that oversees alcohol approved a rule change Tuesday. Members of the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services Commission voted unanimously to allow spirits to be sold in sizes slightly larger than the average shot or glass of wine, Fox 13 reported. The commission plans to open the proposed rule change to public comment and, barring concerns, could institute it by the fall. A decadeslong prohibition on miniature alcohol bottles is one of many unique liquor laws in Utah, where a majority of the population are members of the alcohol-eschewing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Church officials have said the state’s laws are reasonable and effectively curtail excessive drinking and DUIs while still allowing people to drink responsibly. As Utah draws an increasing number of tourists and residents who aren’t members of the church, new tensions have arisen over the state’s liquor laws and concerns have grown over whether they entrench the state’s reputation as a religiously conservative place intolerant of those who drink alcohol. Alcohol regulators said the push bring back mini-bottles came from businesses in tourist-reliant parts of the state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Shelburne Street roundabout will soon be completely open to traffic after a year of construction, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Although the $10 million project won't officially be done until next spring, the roundabout will be fully functional in late summer or early, fall said project manager Mike LaCroix via email. Planners hope the roundabout will lead to a safer situation for motorists and pedestrians as the former maze of merging lanes contributed to many serious accidents. The roundabout will be located at the intersection of Shelburne Road, South Willard Street, Ledge Road and Locust Street in the south end. Workers are now installing streetlights, curbing, splitter islands and sidewalks, as well as paving the shared-use paths and roadway, applying temporary line striping and making landscaping enhancements. This work will continue for the next few months.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A Virginia company and its owner have agreed to pay $310,000 to resolve allegations they violated federal and state law by submitting false bills to Medicare and Medicaid, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Jacob Patterson, 66 of Danville was a pharmacist who owned and operated Piedmont Infusion Services. The company employed nurses and nursing assistants to provide patients with compounded ,prescriptions as well as needle and catheter method medications ordered by their physicians, the department’s news release said. Piedmont Infusion Services did not employ a physician or “physician extender” such as a physician’s assistant to provide patient care. From 2013 through the beginning of 2018, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid for high-level office visits that didn’t occur, a news release said. In addition, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services also fraudulently double-billed Medicare Part B for medications already billed to Medicare Part D. Prosecutors said a former employee of Piedmont Infusion Services came forward as a whistleblower and helped the government in its investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle chapter of the Audubon Society said it is dropping “Audubon” from its name because the man the organization is named after was a slave owner and opposed abolition. KNKX reported Seattle Audubon is one the largest chapters of the National Audubon Society, the nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats. Earlier this month, the board voted to change the chapter’s name because the man the organization is named after – illustrator, painter and bird lover John James Audubon, author of the seminal work “The Birds of America” – owned enslaved people. J. Drew Lanham, a former board member of the National Audubon Society and a wildlife ecology professor at Clemson University, called the move courageous. Lanham, who has written about Audubon and left the national chapter over concerns the nonprofit was not doing enough about racial equity, said organizations need to grapple with what to do about problematic monuments. Last year, the Audubon Naturalist Society, a Washington-based environmental organization, said it would remove “Audubon” from its name, but it is not affiliated with the National Audubon Society. Seattle Audubon said it plans to choose a new name by the end of the year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia corrections commissioner Betsy Jividen is resigning, Gov. Jim Justice said. Jividen’s resignation is effective Aug. 5. Justice said Tuesday he will begin the process of filling the vacancy. Jividen was appointed to lead the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 2018. She served as an acting and interim U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. Her work as an assistant federal prosecutor dates to 1980. The corrections division operates 15 prisons, work-release centers and related facilities. It has more than 2,000 employees.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels said during a debate he can be taken at his word that he won’t raise gas taxes. Primary challenger Rebecca Kleefisch accused him of not taking responsibility for previously being in leadership roles for groups that backed increasing gas taxes. Kleefisch, Michels and state Rep. Tim Ramthun debated on the radio three days after a television debate and less than two weeks before the Aug. 9 primary. The winner will advance to face Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in November. Michels, who is endorsed by Donald Trump and co-owns the state’s largest construction company, Michels Corp., said he “never once” said he wanted to raise the gas tax. He said the groups he was on that lobbied for raising the gas tax, including the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, came to a consensus on issues and he didn’t always agree. Kleefisch and former Gov. Scott Walker have attacked Michels over the gas tax issue.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A judge temporarily blocked the state’s abortion ban on the day it took effect, siding with a women’s health clinic and others who argued the ban would harm health care workers and their patients and violate the state constitution. Attorneys arguing in front of Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens in Jackson disagreed over whether the state Constitution provided a right to abortion. Owens was sympathetic, however, with arguments that the ban left pregnant women with dangerous complications and their doctors in a difficult position. “That is a possible irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. They are left with no guidance,” Owens said. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling – a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. Those suing in Wyoming include a nonprofit opening a Casper women’s and LGBTQ health clinic that would have offered abortions. A May arson attack has set back the clinic’s opening from mid-June until at least the end of this year, months past the start of Wyoming’s new abortion ban. The four Wyoming women and two nonprofits that sued Monday claim the new law violates several rights guaranteed by the state constitution, including a “fundamental right to be left alone by the government.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/27/subway-thanksgiving-high-horse-gift-wrap-wars-news-around-states/40714889/", "title": "A subway Thanksgiving, too-high horse: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A new statue of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks will be unveiled at Court Square downtown Sunday at 1 p.m. The unveiling Dec. 1 will coincide with the day in 1955 when Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a white man. Along with the Parks memorial, the city will present two historic markers for Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses unconstitutional. The civil rights memorials are a partnership among the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency will decide by September how much ocean and coast will be designated as critical habitat for two ice seal species found in the state. The Center for Biological Diversity announced Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Commerce Department for the Trump administration to issue a critical habitat rule for ringed and bearded seals. Ringed and bearded seals live off Alaska’s northwest coast. Both are listed as threatened. Designation of critical habitat for threatened species is required by the Endangered Species Act a year after a listing. The Center for Biological Diversity sued in June because no critical habitat has been designated. Federal agencies that authorize activities such as oil drilling within critical habitat must consult with wildlife managers to determine if threatened species will be affected.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: For many elementary students, this time of year is filled with lessons about Thanksgiving, often arts and crafts or plays about the Pilgrims. That’s not the case for students at schools like Salt River Elementary and Puente de Hozho. Instead, these students get lessons that give insight into and strengthen their identity as indigenous people, focusing on fall harvest traditions and the importance of giving thanks. Teaching the myth of Thanksgiving is not required in the state’s standards for history and social studies. Salt River Elementary is a Bureau of Indian Education school located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and 100% of the student body is Native American. The school incorporates cultural and traditional learning within its curriculum. During November, many teachers increase those lessons for Native American Heritage Month. As for Thanksgiving, “we only talk about being thankful and being with family,” says Clarice Garcia, a fifth grade teacher. In the weeks leading up to the holiday, Garcia said she tries to talk about the positive and negative impacts explorers had on indigenous people, letting students form their own opinion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas is now the home of a photo archive containing nearly a million photos of historical figures and events. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the collection arrived at the campus in Fayetteville last month. The archive includes photos of Babe Ruth, Bonnie Parker, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King. There are also pictures documenting politics, wars, natural disasters and the civil rights movement. Dean of libraries Dennis T. Clark says the large trove is very significant in American journalism. He says it is the New York Post’s photo archive, which contains photos dating back to the 1860s. Lori Birrell, head of the special collections department at the UA library, says the collection will show the university is interested in having a national and international presence. Clark says the gift came from an anonymous donor in 2017.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has a pair of quirky new arrivals from Australia: platypuses. Last week the zoo publicly debuted an 8-year-old male named Birrarung and a 15-year-old female named Eve. The pair were flown to the park late last month. The zoo says it’s the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses – egg-laying mammals with furry bodies and ducklike bills – have been cared for outside of Australia. Safari Park’s lead keeper, Lori Hieber, says the pair have settled into their new, specially built habitat. She says they swim in the pools, play in the waterfalls and hunt live crayfish. An international conservation group lists the platypus as a “near threatened” species, mainly from habitat loss and the potential destruction from climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court has denied a request to reconsider a ruling declaring the sentences of hundreds of criminal defendants to be illegal. The Denver Post reports the justices refused to rethink whether criminal offenders could be sentenced to both prison and probation in the same case. Officials say the court ruled in September that defendants couldn’t be simultaneously sentenced. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a petition this month challenging the decision, saying it could create extensive litigation affecting hundreds or even thousands of plea agreements and leading to numerous challenges. Officials say defendants convicted by a jury must be resentenced. Authorities say witnesses might have moved away, police investigators might have retired, and victims might not want to testify again, causing problems in the process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state will soon host its second inauguration of 2019. On Monday, West Hartford fifth grader Myra Stanfield will become the 2020 Kid Governor, succeeding 2019’s Ella Briggs. A ceremony is planned at the Old State House in Hartford. Like Ella, Myra was elected to the one-year position by fifth graders across Connecticut. She ran on a platform of preventing animal abuse. Her term begins in January. The civics education program was created in 2015 by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, now known as the Connecticut Democracy Center. Participating students are given an opportunity to create a campaign platform around an issue, run for office and vote in the election. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose inauguration was 11 months ago, released a video online congratulating Myra.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Department of Insurance is warning residents about a new Medicare tool that state officials say causes confusion and conceals the total cost of coverage. In what he described as a rare consumer alert, Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said in a press release that the department has received numerous complaints about Medicare’s Prescription Plan Finder. The tool, created by the federal government and used by millions, is supposed to help find and compare Medicare coverage options for the current enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Navarro said the tool’s “focus on premium costs can deflect focus from higher personal costs at the pharmacy counter.” The tool organizes responses, Navarro said, by showing lowest premium costs first. But previous versions of the tool showed it by total annual costs. And if residents enter multiple medications, they could receive search results for plans that don’t cover all those they entered, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is joining several states in suing e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, saying the company’s online ads and promotions illegally targeted minors. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging that Juul’s viral marketing contributed to the surge in underage vaping by teens in the district and across the U.S. The move follows similar lawsuits filed by California, New York and North Carolina. Several other states are also investigating Juul, which dominates the U.S. vaping market. Under intense pressure, Juul has suspended its U.S. advertising and halted sales of all but two of its flavors. Additionally, the company closed its social media accounts and tightened age verification for online sales. Representatives for Juul did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: The local school district is bringing in a crack squad of four-legged experts to deal with an overgrown patch of rough terrain, where hidden gopher tortoises, snakes, steep banks and vertical drop-offs make it too hazardous for grounds crews to handle. About two dozen goats will descend into a fenced area around a pond next to Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville next week. Grounds services supervisor Matt Nolle says the area is too dangerous for heavy equipment or even people on foot. Goats are better for the environment and can get into places humans can’t. “Somehow, four legs is an advantage,” Nolle says. The Brevard School District is paying about $4,500 to hire the goats from Rent-a-Ruminant, a landscaping livestock company.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia Southern University has officially opened a learning center in Ireland. Savannah Morning News reports university leaders traveled to Wexford last week for the ceremonial event. A news release from the university says the center stems from a longtime partnership between the town and Savannah, as well as Georgia Southern’s Center for Irish Research and Teaching. The school says many Savannah residents claim Irish ancestry and can trace ancestors specifically to Wexford. University President Kyle Marrero met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins during the visit. The school says it marked the first official meeting between a Georgia Southern president and a foreign head of state. The school says Georgia Southern is the first public university in the United States to open an outreach learning facility in Ireland.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Education plans to offer free Hawaiian language courses to its employees. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the department’s 22,000 salaried employees, including 13,000 teachers, will be able to take courses beginning in January. Officials say the program is a partnership between the education department’s Office of Hawaiian Education and the University of Hawaii’s community colleges. The education department has incorporated Hawaiian language, culture and history in its curriculum since an 80-year public education ban on the language was overturned at the 1978 state constitutional convention. Employees can enroll in scheduled courses at seven community colleges beginning in the spring semester or join customized courses for education department staff groups. Teachers completing courses will receive professional development credits, while other employees will be given college credit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Fisheries managers are optimistic a program to save imperiled Snake River sockeye salmon is heading in the right direction despite few of the ocean-going fish making it back to central Idaho this year. Of the 735,000 young sockeye released in the state in 2017, only 17 survived the 900-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean and then back again to arrive as adults in the Sawtooth Basin near Stanley. But John Powell of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said last week that fish raised to adults in hatcheries will keep the population going. Biologists also released 610 adults this fall into central Idaho lakes to spawn naturally. Powell also says biologists have solved problems that caused most of the young hatchery sockeye to die shortly after being released into the wild in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: There are full slates of special events and celebrations scheduled for the holiday season at two state historic sites in the city. Santa will be available regularly at the Old State Capitol to collect children’s Christmas wishes, and specially themed tours are scheduled for the Dana-Thomas House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Children and families may visit with St. Nick and play holiday games at the Old State Capitol from 1 to 5 p.m. each Saturday from Nov. 30 to Dec. 21 and from 5 to 8 p.m. each Wednesday from Dec. 4 to 18. Each day will feature a different musical group as well. A dozen variously themed tours of the Dana-Thomas House are scheduled periodically from Nov. 29 through Dec. 20. Some require reservations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is facing calls from Democrats to explain his role in Amazon being cleared of responsibility for a warehouse worker’s death despite initial findings of major safety violations. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb denies any involvement in the state’s investigation of the 2017 death at Amazon’s Plainfield warehouse. The news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting reports a safety inspector ordered a $28,000 fine against Amazon, concluding it didn’t provide enough training before a forklift fatally crushed 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry. It cites a recording the inspector made in which his boss tells Amazon officials how to shift the blame to “employee misconduct.” The death investigation happened while the Holcomb administration was bidding on Amazon’s planned second headquarters project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has pardoned two tom turkeys, continuing a long-standing Thanksgiving tradition celebrating the state’s turkey industry. The male birds named Benjamin and Franklin will live at Living History Farms in Urbandale, a 500-acre, open-air history museum that demonstrates three centuries of Iowa farm life. Reynolds held the annual event Tuesday at Terrace Hill, the governor’s residence, where she says she’ll spend Thanksgiving cooking for her family. Several family members, including grandchildren, petted the turkeys after Reynolds read the proclamation freeing them from becoming a thanksgiving meal. Iowa ranks seventh in U.S. turkey production, turning out more than 12 million turkeys annually on 130 farms. The state is fifth in turkey processing with plants in Storm Lake and West Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly reveled in holiday spirit Tuesday for the annual horse-drawn delivery of a Christmas tree to Cedar Crest, the official governor’s residence. The first-year governor said for years she has watched the celebration on the news with the rest of the state, and it was a “treat” to preside over the event. Every year, a member of the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association donates a tree for the occasion. Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm near Lawrence donated this year’s model. Robin Dunn, of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville, guided percherons Bill and Bruce as they pulled a replica Wells Fargo stagecoach up the drive to the front of the governor’s mansion to deliver the tree. Dunn said she has now delivered trees to five Kansas governors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s politicos are getting all wrapped up in the Christmas wars this year. After the reelection campaign for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., began selling gift wrap featuring the Senate majority leader’s face with a Santa hat and a green bow tie – reminiscent of an iconic image of Christmas crooner Bing Crosby – the Kentucky Democratic Party has shot back with its own bespoke present paper. A donation of $30 to the commonwealth’s blue party yields a roll of red “Moscow Mitch” wrapping paper, featuring yellow images of the Republican wearing a Cossack hat with the “hammer and sickle” symbol on top of the words “Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch,” referring to a nickname McConnell received over the summer. “Anything @Team_Mitch can do, we can do better,” the Kentucky Democratic Party wrote in a tweet.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state museum system is asking for feedback as it works to update its governance, operations and attendance at its properties. The museum system wants people to fill out a five- to 10-minute survey about their interest in the facilities and their experiences at them. The survey will be available online until Saturday. The Louisiana state museum system includes the Cabildo and the Presbytere in New Orleans, the New Orleans Jazz Museum, the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, among other facilities. Survey participants can enter to win a membership through the Friends of the Cabildo that gives free admission for two people and any children to all public state museum properties.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: Officials say a new partnership with the state’s farmers markets has expanded the number of people who can use the markets by making food assistance easier to access. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it has partnered with the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets to help pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program processing equipment. The technology can cost hundreds of dollars, which prices many small markets out of the ability to buy it. About 1 in 8 Maine residents uses SNAP. The state says a half-dozen farmers markets have received new SNAP processing gear through the partnership since July. Maine has a total of about 35 farmers markets that accept SNAP.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore: The National Park Service will institute a modest increase for all parks that charge entrance fees next year, including on Assateague Island. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, entrance fees at Assateague Island National Seashore will be modified to align with standardized rates being implemented nationwide for similar national park areas at the rate of an extra $5 per category. A seven-day pass to the park will be $25 per vehicle or $20 per motorcycle. An annual park pass will cost $45, and individuals will be charged $15 per person when entering by commercial vehicle. An entrance pass provides seven consecutive days of access to the seashore and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. The additional funds will be used for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Native Americans are gathering for a 50th year in the seaside town where the Pilgrims settled – not to give thanks but to grieve. United American Indians of New England held its first National Day of Mourning in 1970. Since then, tribes have assembled at noon every Thanksgiving Day on a windswept hill overlooking Plymouth Rock. On Thursday, they’ll recall what organizers describe as “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture.” That’s an in-your-feast message, but co-leader Mahtowin Munro says the group is determined to get Americans to look beyond the Thanksgiving myth of European settlers and native people coexisting peacefully. Next year, Plymouth marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: Leaders with Flint Community Schools are considering closing four of the district’s 12 school buildings amid a $5.7 million budget deficit partly driven by rising special education costs not covered by the state. Superintendent Derrick Lopez presented the proposal at a special school board meeting last week. It also calls for the restructuring four other district buildings. The plan would decrease transportation, security, maintenance, administrative and other expenses. Lopez says the district’s special education student number has greatly risen from just under 15% in the 2014-15 school year, as Flint’s water crisis began, to now 24%. Flint’s water was lead-contaminated when officials used corrosive river water from April 2014 to October 2015. In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, ability to focus and academic achievement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have warned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that a proposal to streamline water quality laws would cripple their authority to protect drinking water, streams and wildlife from dozens of new projects each year. The EPA’s proposal targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states to set their own conditions, conduct reviews, and approve or deny projects that could potentially pollute waterways. The change would give federal authorities power to dismiss conditions set by states or tribes and allow the EPA to overrule a state’s project denial. It would also prevent states from studying indirect sources of water pollution. But the Star Tribune reports that a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce official says some businesses welcome the changes. The EPA says states use their authority to impose conditions not related to water quality.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Magnolia State residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore. Tickets went on sale Monday at roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites. The Mississippi Lottery Corporation says people bought a total of $2.5 million in lottery tickets on the first day of sales, which translates into $570,000 for the state. Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson has been pushing for years to bring a lottery to Mississippi. She bought a ceremonial first ticket at a RaceWay store and gas station in south Jackson. “It feels great. Finally, it becomes a reality. And it just goes to show you what happens if you don’t give up,” Clarke said. For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery amid strong opposition from politically powerful churches. People often drove to neighboring states such as Louisiana to buy tickets there.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Comedian Heidi Gardner is flipping the switch on an annual holiday lighting ceremony at the upscale Country Club Plaza shopping and dining district. The “Saturday Night Light” cast member says getting the starring role at the Thanksgiving night event once seemed “crazy” and “out of reach.” The Kansas City native was working on the Plaza in 1998 when actor Paul Rudd did the honors, lighting up several blocks of buildings. And she told The Kansas City Star that she has long had a picture of the Plaza lights on her refrigerator. The ceremony dates back to the 1930s. The only time the Plaza lights were not in operation occurred in 1973, when President Richard Nixon called upon all Americans to curtail the use of Christmas lights to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Board of Regents has approved a $150,000 pay raise to retain Waded Cruzado as the president of Montana State University after she received an offer for a higher-paying job. Supporters say Cruzado’s vision and fundraising ability make her worth the $476,000 annual salary, while opponents note her raise is nearly three times the median household income in the state. Commissioner of Higher Education Clay Christian supported the raise, saying it would allow Cruzado to continue the momentum she has created on the Bozeman campus. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports two classified MSU employees noted some workers are paid less than $11 an hour, vacancies are hard to fill, and people have left because they can’t afford to live in Bozeman. Regents on Friday also approved a 2% or 50-cent-per-hour raise for university system employees, whichever is greater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is temporarily lifting weight restrictions on trucks carrying propane to address a shortage of heating fuels. State officials have suspended the 90,000-pound gross weight limit for motor carriers hauling critically needed heating fuels through Dec. 15. Lt. Gov. Mike Foley issued the order last week on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the state. Officials say drivers exceeding the normal weight limits must carry a copy of the executive order to document that they are providing direct support to the state. The order doesn’t apply to the interstate system. State officials say the shortage isn’t serious, but they’re monitoring it. They say more extreme shortages in surrounding states have increased the need to transport through Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A multibillion-dollar megaresort taking shape on the north end of the Strip is on track to become the most expensive hotel-casino project ever built. Malaysia-based Genting Group says the company’s Resorts World Las Vegas is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The cost of the project, initially targeted for a 2016 opening on the former site of the Stardust, was last estimated at $4 billion. Now it sits at $4.3 billion. That would make Resorts World Las Vegas more expensive than the development of the $4 billion Cosmopolitan. With the inflated price tag comes new features, according to the company, including a 5,000-capacity “state-of-the-art theater” scalable to host A-list residencies and corporate events; a 75,000-square-foot “nightlife and daylife concept”; and a 50-foot-diameter video globe to display over 6,000 square feet of LED content.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: Gov. Chris Sununu’s advisory board has voted to eliminate tolls on one of the state’s heavily traveled highways. The Executive Council voted Monday to get rid of the Merrimack tolls at the Everett Turnpike. The highway links Massachusetts and the New Hampshire cities of Manchester and Concord. Drivers currently pay 50 cents on the on and off ramps at the exits. The tolls bring in more than $1 million each year, but a transportation commission has decided that it puts Merrimack residents under an unfair burden. The tollbooths that were built 30 years ago will remain, but starting Jan. 1, motorists will be allowed to drive through without paying a toll.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Officials are hoping the return of redesigned holiday decorations will keep the season bright for commuters who travel through the Holland Tunnel. A slightly larger Christmas tree than the one used last year will be placed to cover the letter “A,” and a wreath will cover the letter “O.” A menorah will be positioned adjacent to the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the tunnel. After complaints that the decades-old decorations over the New York-bound tunnel were distracting, more than 21,000 people last year voted in a poll commissioned by tunnel operator the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Voters wanted the tree moved from over the “N” in “Holland” to cover the “A” and the wreath moved from over the “U.” The decorations go up Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCimarron: One of the most spectacular properties owned by the Boy Scouts of America is being mortgaged to help secure the youth organization’s line of credit. The Boy Scouts say there is no plan to sell the Philmont Scout Ranch in Colfax County. It is being used as collateral to help meet financial needs that include rising insurance costs related to sex-abuse litigation. The move dismayed a member of Philmont’s oversight committee, who says it violates agreements made when the land was donated in 1938. The BSA disputed his assertion. The mortgage document was signed by top Boy Scout officials in March. But members of the Philmont Ranch Committee only recently learned of the development. The ranch is a popular destination for hiking and camping trips.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Thanksgiving came early for a group of New York City commuters who enjoyed a holiday feast on a subway train. Video footage shows riders standing behind a white-clothed table covered with plates of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread in the middle of a Brooklyn-bound L train on Sunday. Stand-up comedian Jodell “Joe Show” Lewis tells the New York Post he organized the Thanksgiving dinner to “bring a little excitement to commuters” and feed any New Yorkers who might be hungry. Lewis says he chose the L train after he saw how “dreary and upset” riders were at the inconvenience of a construction project that has cut service on the line.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Students and employees at all University of North Carolina system campuses will be able to use their school identification cards for the state’s voter ID mandate starting in 2020. The State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday the approval of cards for students and employees at 12 of the 17 UNC schools. These IDs were rejected earlier this year because they didn’t meet standards set in a law implementing the photo ID requirement. The ID mandate was added to the state constitution in 2018. The General Assembly altered ID security rules last spring so schools with rejected cards could apply again for next year. The board says more than 150 types of photo ID are approved for use with the March primary. A driver’s license is the most common.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There will be a runoff election for a new state Supreme Court chief justice. None of the three justices running to lead the high court received the majority votes necessary on Monday to clinch the position. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jon Jensen were the top vote-getters, followed by Daniel Crothers. McEvers and Jensen are still in the running. The ballots were cast by the state’s 52 district court judges and each of the five justices on the high court. They will now recast their votes, to be tallied in early December. The chief justice position was left open after 86-year-old Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle announced in September that he would not seek reappointment to the top post when his term expires at the end of the year.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city’s zoo has welcomed a new baby giraffe shortly after losing the 12-year-old male giraffe that sired him. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden says 8-year-old Cece delivered the calf Saturday, and mom and baby are doing fine. Zoo officials say it’s too soon to determine the sex of the 6-foot-tall calf. The calf was the seventh sired by Kimba, who died earlier this month from complications following a surgical procedure on his hooves. The calf is the 17th giraffe born at the zoo. Giraffe populations in the wild are being affected by habitat loss, trophy hunting and illegal poaching, Zoo officials say up to 75% of calves in the wild die in their first few months of life, mainly due to predators.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new study has found that nearly 500 older, low-income Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The Oklahoman reports that a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis estimates 476 state residents between the ages of 55 and 64 died prematurely from 2014 to 2017 because the state declined to expand eligibility for the federal health care program. The left-leaning think tank says they are among 15,600 such deaths that could have been avoided nationally if all states had expanded Medicaid. The Washington, D.C.-based group says its estimates are based on mortality data and records and data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Republican leaders in the state dismissed the study as irresponsible and reckless.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians are being called to take pictures of the coast this week, for science. Coastwatch volunteer coordinator Jesse Jones says photos of extra high tides happening through Thursday can help scientists learn how different communities will be affected by climate change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports photographs taken by citizen scientists and assembled by the Oregon King Tides Project can show where the water might be when the oceans rise. The Oregon King Tides project wants pictures from all along the coast to help figure out how to plan for rising seas. In particular, they need photographs of beaches as well as familiar landmarks like jetties, bridges, buildings, roads, seawall, shorelines, beach infrastructure and estuaries. Jones notes that the most helpful beach pictures are taken facing north or south so that it’s clear how far in or out the tide has come. Participants can upload the images to the Oregon King Tides website or post them to social media with the hashtags #orkingtides and #kingtides.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: The state overhauled its child sexual abuse laws Tuesday, more than a year after a grand jury report showed the cover-up of hundreds of cases of abuse in most of Pennsylvania’s Roman Catholic dioceses over the past seven decades. The central bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf gives future victims of child sex abuse more time to file lawsuits and ends time limits for police to file criminal charges. The grand jury report spurred several states to change their laws and other states to begin similar investigations. Wolf said the new laws will help repair “faults in our justice system that prevent frightened, abused children from seeking justice when they grow into courageous adults.” Wolf signed the bills at Muhlenberg High School in Reading, the home district of Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi, a champion of the legislation who has spoken publicly about being raped as a 13-year-old by a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city is working with Brown University to create a digital map of one of the nation’s largest and most intact Colonial-era African burial grounds. The city wants a high-resolution map of God’s Little Acre to serve as the foundation for future site management and exploration. Doctoral students from the Ivy League university are working on the project. The Preservation Society of Newport County says the burial ground contains about 200 professionally carved headstones for enslaved and freed Africans from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when African graves were typically left unmarked in the United States. City officials hope the map will be ready next summer so it can be made available to the public through a smartphone app and online. Tours currently rely on a printed map.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLoris: A farm animal with unbridled ambition has given new meaning to the phrase “get off your high horse.” Horry County Fire Rescue workers say they were called Sunday to a barn in Loris, where a horse somehow managed to leave its stall and climb into a hayloft. They had to bring in heavy equipment, and large-animal veterinarians helped sedate the horse before it was lowered to the ground on a makeshift platform. The horse has moved on to greener pastures, seemingly in good spirits in a grazing field. Rescue workers still haven’t figured out how the horse managed to climb a narrow set of stairs into the loft.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The last living worker who helped construct Mount Rushmore National Memorial has died. Donald “Nick” Clifford of Keystone, South Dakota, was 98. His wife, Carolyn Clifford, says he died Saturday at a hospice in Rapid City. At 17, Nick Clifford was the youngest worker hired to work at Mount Rushmore, in the state’s Black Hills. He operated a winch that carried workers up and down the mountain where the faces of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved, and he drilled holes for dynamite. The Rapid City Journal reports that Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln, decided in 1938 to field a baseball team and hired Clifford, who already was a veteran pitcher and right fielder. Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, earning 55 cents an hour.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal officials are proposing removing the Nashville crayfish from the endangered species list. A news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says a review has found the crayfish populations are “healthy, stable and robust.” The 7-inch crustacean lives only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville. The last review of the crayfish by the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended listing the species as “threatened.” Tierra Curry says that would be a better option. The senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity says Nashville is developing rapidly, and giving the species threatened status would allow it some continued protection. The proposal for delisting was published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments through Jan. 27.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An English teacher who was fired after tweeting that her high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark’s tweet was protected by the First Amendment. Clark can either receive back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year’s salary. District spokeswoman Barbara Griffith says Morath’s ruling was a technicality, and the district is exploring its options. Clark’s attorney didn’t respond for a comment. The district board voted in June to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump and that she didn’t realize her postings were public.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Two of the state’s small cities tested an alternative method of voting that allows people to rank candidates from first to last during recent municipal elections. The Daily Herald reports six cities had planned to test the ranked-choice voting system, but four backed out over concerns about how to explain how it works to voters. Vineyard and Payson were the municipalities that tried out a method that allows voters to rank candidates from first to last. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated. The process continues for several rounds until a candidate gets the majority of votes. Vineyard City Recorder Pamela Spencer says she only received a few calls from confused voters and considered it a success.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Four local high school journalists have won an award for their victory over censorship. Last year, the Burlington High students broke a story in their school newspaper about a school employee facing unprofessional conduct charges. The interim principal asked the students’ adviser to take it down. The article was removed, but students kept up links to it on social media, saying it was censored. Students talked to legal experts, and the newspaper cited its rights under the “New Voices” law that protects First Amendment rights of student journalists. Last week the students were awarded the Courage in Student Journalism Award, sponsored by the Student Press Law Center, the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University and the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials are reminding Virginians it’s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Department of Health encourages everyone older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying from influenza.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council is proceeding with a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides pitched by Mayor Jenny Durkan to help pay for affordable housing and the delayed downtown streetcar and to give new support to ride-hailing drivers. The Seattle Times reports council members unanimously approved the 57-cent tax Monday. Durkan and the council have also promised to ensure Uber and Lyft drivers make Seattle’s $16 minimum wage starting next summer, but the city first plans to study driver pay. The new tax stops short of a more widespread tolling scheme some say is necessary to truly address congestion choking downtown streets. Durkan’s administration has explored the concept of congestion pricing, in which all drivers downtown would pay a toll. Uber and Lyft back that type of widespread charge and decried the new tax, claiming it could stymie ridership and hurt drivers. Durkan’s office projects the new tax will raise about $25 million a year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It’s officially buck hunting season in the Mountain State. The annual buck firearms season kicked off this week and is expected to bring thousands of hunters to the state’s vast woodlands. Officials say starting the season toward the end of November increases the chances of hunting during snowfall, which makes it easier to spot and track deer. The season traditionally opens on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Hunters can harvest two deer on the same day, but only one can be an antlered buck. Anyone who wants an additional buck must buy a stamp from the state and have additional licensing. Gary Foster of the Division of Natural Resources says the state’s deer seasons help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state’s economy. Buck firearms season ends Dec. 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic lawmakers want more diaper-changing stations in the state. State Reps. Jonathan Brostoff and David Crowley and state Sen. Chris Larson have introduced a bill that would require public and commercial buildings built or renovated after the bill becomes law to have diaper-changing stations in every restroom. Owners of commercial buildings with public restrooms would have to post signs identifying bathrooms with changing stations. Brostoff says he’s a new father, and he’s constantly struck by how few businesses have changing stations and how many place them only in women’s restrooms. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about Republican support for the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The family of a man who was shot and killed by police officers is suing the city and the Casper Police Department. Daniel Wolosin alleges in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court that police officials failed to properly train officers in de-escalation techniques and failed to enforce policies that would have prevented the death of 38-year-old David Wolosin. Authorities say Wolosin opened fire first in the May 2018 shootout after two officers were called to check on a report of a man allowing children to drive a car on a dirt lot. Officer Jacob Carlson was shot multiple times by Wolosin and nearly died. City attorney John Henley told the Casper Star-Tribune he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. Prosecutors previously determined the officers’ actions were justified.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/06/01/phoenix-concerts-june-2019/1280020001/", "title": "Phoenix concerts in June 2019: Paul McCartney, Nav, Coheed and ...", "text": "Santana return to the Valley a night before Rob Thomas, who famously collaborated with the Woodstock veterans on their Grammy-winning '90s comeback single, \"Smooth.\"\n\nJune also brings a major tour launch for Khalid and Phoenix date for Paul McCartney, whose concert is certain to feature an outrageous number of songs he first recorded with a group he hasn't toured with in several decades.

The following contains minor spoilers about the ending of Queen biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"\n\nNEW YORK – Playing Freddie Mercury on the big screen is daunting enough. But having to re-create the Queen frontman's most iconic concert on the very first day of shooting?\n\n\"It was a baptism by fire,\" says Rami Malek, who charismatically performs the British rocker's entire Live Aid show at the end of the biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (in theaters now). \"You walk out there on that stage as it was replicated from the day, and there was a feeling like you could never imagine of extreme euphoria. You just need to live up to that moment.\"\n\nLive Aid, the massive charity concert for famine relief in Africa, drew more than a billion TV viewers worldwide when it was staged on July 13, 1985, at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The star-studded lineup included pop and rock acts such as Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Elton John, U2 and Queen, who played a 22-minute set featuring hits \"Radio Ga Ga,\" \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\nIt serves as the centerpiece of the electrifying finale of \"Bohemian,\" which comes just after Mercury's (Malek) devastating diagnosis with HIV/AIDS. Unsure how much time he has left, the ailing Mercury agrees to do the show and make amends with his former bandmates, whom he alienated when he left Queen to pursue a solo career. (In reality, Mercury hadn't yet been diagnosed, and the band was still together.)\n\nThe rousing sequence was shot over the course of a week on an old air strip in North London, where the stage of the since-demolished Wembley was built to scale. Cameras were hoisted on cranes and throughout the audience of 2,000 extras, who were multiplied with CGI to replicate the 70,000 concertgoers who packed the stadium for the benefit.\n\nIt was cold and rainy in mid-July when production started on the film, but that didn't dampen the spirits of the enthusiastic crowd on the set. Original Live Aid producer Bob Geldof was in attendance, as were Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, who weighed in on costumes and shared memories from the legendary concert with cast and crew.\n\n\"Everyone, from me to the caterer, was out there clapping along to the songs and cheering on (the actors), because it was all about the atmosphere and energy,\" \"Bohemian\" producer Graham King says. By ending the movie with Live Aid, the goal is \"uplift audiences, rather than have them leave feeling depressed or emotional about Freddie and what he went through in his personal life. It's a real celebration.\"\n\nMore:Rami Malek's immigrant upbringing (and fake teeth) helped him find Queen's Freddie Mercury\n\nRelated:Rami Malek 'totally understands' criticism that Queen film straightwashes Freddie Mercury\n\nReview:Rami Malek rocks as Freddie Mercury, but 'Bohemian Rhapsody' isn't a killer Queen biopic\n\nMalek and his co-stars Gwilym Lee (who plays May), Ben Hardy (Taylor) and Joseph Mazzello (bassist John Deacon) had six weeks of rehearsal prior to shooting Live Aid, in which they worked with movement coach Polly Bennett and meticulously studied footage from the show on YouTube. After performing a different song every day, they ran through the whole set three times consecutively on the last day of filming – a Herculean feat that left Malek feeling \"exhausted but elated.\"\n\n\"Doing the entire run-through of that concert, you feel the peaks and valleys of where the adrenaline is kicking in,\" Malek says. \"You’re so high off adrenaline that you realize that’s exactly how they were able to do what they were doing. It’s that quality that makes you feel, even just for a moment, that you’re superhuman.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/12/30/final-goodbye-roll-call-died/21064307/", "title": "Final goodbye: Roll call of some who died in 2014", "text": "Bernard Mcghee\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nA feeling of untimeliness defined several of the deaths in the entertainment arena in 2014, including several who called the Lower Hudson Valley home.\n\nThe suicide of actor and comedian Robin Williams touched off a national conversation about depression.

Now, Britain’s iconic watering holes say they are battling an even greater threat: soaring energy prices.\n\nThe chief executives of six leading pub and brewing businesses are warning that surging bills for electricity, heating and other essential supplies could force many pubs and craft breweries to close, leading to a wave of job losses as the country braces for a recession.\n\n“Across our businesses we are witnessing price rises which are causing irreversible damage,” they wrote in a letter to the UK government calling for immediate help. “Hikes can now be upwards of 300% on pre-pandemic energy bills, with the current average increase around 150% across the beer and pub sector, putting jobs and businesses at risk.”\n\nNick Mackenzie, the head of the Greene King pub chain, said one location it works with reported that energy costs had gone up by £33,000 ($38,744) a year.\n\n“While the government has introduced measures to help households cope with this spike in prices, businesses are having to face this alone, and it is only going to get worse come the autumn,” Mackenzie said.\n\nGraffiti covers a closed-down pub in London. Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nSome pubs were being quoted increases of more than 400% in the price of one-year gas supply contracts, while others were finding it impossible to secure contracts at all, said Kevin Georgel, CEO of St Austell Brewery.\n\n“The cost of energy threatens to cause mass business failure and the loss of thousands of pubs across the country,” he added.\n\nThe UK energy regulator Ofgem announced last week that bills for households would rise 80% to an average of £3,549 ($4,159) a year from October. CEO Jonathan Brearley said Britain’s next prime minister would need to take immediate action when they take office next week to limit the fallout.\n\n“The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us,” he said.\n\nThe situation is expected to get worse before it gets better. Energy markets are extremely volatile as traders consider whether Russia could completely cut off gas flows to Europe just as the weather gets cold and more energy is needed. The United Kingdom also has less storage for gas than the rest of Europe, which has been stockpiling supplies.\n\nThat’s stoking alarm about eye-watering costs for households into next year. But businesses say they’re not getting enough help either, emphasizing that the crisis will leave many on life support.\n\nJust thought I might update you on the latest ‘best’ energy deal available for a pub of our size.\n\n\n\nWe were paying 15p/unit in May. This is the best quote available today. pic.twitter.com/2r5HmCcKns — The Rose and Crown (@RoseAndCrownBeb) August 27, 2022\n\n“Small businesses are left out in the cold when it comes to energy bills, with the vast majority excluded from the household energy price cap and other protections designed for domestic household consumers,” Martin McTague, who heads up the Federation of Small Businesses, said in a statement last week.\n\n“Unlike large corporates, small firms cannot hedge costs and negotiate deals with their large energy suppliers. Many of our members say the eye-watering energy bills could be the final nail in the coffin as they struggle to get through winter,” he continued.\n\nFor Britain’s pubs, it’s another reason to worry about the future. For years, the industry has struggled as people ditch drinking in pubs for bars, restaurants and their homes. Then the pandemic hit, and the government ordered pubs to close for the first time in the country’s history. Pubs stayed open during World War I and World War II to boost morale.\n\nNow, business conditions are deteriorating again.\n\n“The UK’s brewing industry is facing a crisis far graver than that which we faced during the Covid lockdowns of the past few years,” said Paul Davies, the CEO of British brewer Carlsberg Marstons.\n\nHe noted that gas and energy costs have nearly tripled since 2019 — and it’s not the only expense to go up. The price of malt, a key ingredient in beer, has doubled, and aluminum costs have jumped more than 50%. Brewers are also worried about supplies of carbon dioxide after one of the biggest UK producers closed a plant because of the soaring cost of energy.\n\nThere were 39,973 pubs in England and Wales as of June, the lowest level on record and a decline of more than 7,000 locations since 2012, according to an analysis by the Altus Group.\n\nThe real estate consultancy said that while pubs proved “remarkably resilient” during the pandemic, despite deep uncertainty, the energy crisis and inflation are creating “new headwinds.”", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/economy/craft-beer-industry-sales-rebound/index.html", "title": "It's going to be a 'make-or-break' year for struggling craft brewers ...", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nFor many of the nation’s small and independent brewers, this year will prove to be a true test of their staying power.\n\nEarly data for 2022 shows that brewery closures are on the rise and some sales have been spotty, said Bart Watson, senior economist for the Brewers Association, craft beer’s largest trade organization.\n\nThe pandemic and its ongoing effects, as well as the war in Ukraine, continue to drag down smaller brewers, who are battling climbing costs, rising rents, and seemingly interminable supply chain challenges, Watson said.\n\n“2022 is going to be a make-or-break year for many breweries,” he said earlier this month while delivering the results of the association’s state-of-the-industry report.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2022, at least 53 craft breweries shut their doors, up from 42 closures in the first quarter of last year. That still leaves some 9,100 breweries in operation, but more closures are expected.\n\nAfter being hit hard in 2020, the US craft beer industry started bouncing back last year. But this year, the outlook has grown hazier.\n\n“We still had the government raining down helicopter money [in 2021],” Watson told CNN Business, referring to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a federal pandemic relief program offering aid to struggling restaurants, bars, breweries, wineries and similar businesses. “The [breweries] are going to have to stand on their own [now].”\n\nThe craft beer business was already experiencing some choppiness before the pandemic: In 2019, there were a record 300-plus closures, a reckoning after thousands of breweries had opened up in just a few short years.\n\n“We may see increased closings, but it’s not going to be a huge bubble burst,” Watson said of this year’s projections. “We were already moving toward a more mature place.”\n\nHowever, the current economic outlook – and the war in Ukraine, which has played havoc with crucial commodities like wheat and barley – “could accelerate that,” he said.\n\nThat could mean an increase in consolidation and in brewers paring down, rethinking or shuttering operations, he said.\n\n‘Not clear sailing’\n\nIn North Texas, the Lone Star State has seen popular breweries close their doors in recent weeks, including Legal Draft Beer and Armadillo Ale Works, the Dallas Morning News and Denton Record-Chronicle first reported.\n\n“Poor sales led to the accumulation of expenses and debt and although government assistance helped keep us afloat, we were unable to fully recover,” Armadillo Brewing Company officials said in a Facebook post on March 27.\n\nTexas brewers faced some unique challenges early on in the pandemic because they were initially classified as bars, which were targeted for shutdowns as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Covid-19 measures, said Charles Vallhonrat, executive director of the Texas Craft Brewers Guild.\n\n“Now we face a lot of the challenges a lot of hospitality groups face with supply chain issues and staffing – keeping staff on board, being able to run at capacity, ” he said.\n\nThe supply chain constraints span a number of products breweries rely on, with aluminum for cans and can availability as the biggest issue, Vallhonrat said. But it also extends to shipping costs, delivery timelines for equipment and even the branded glasses sold in brewery gift shops, he said.\n\nIt all adds up, especially if brewers are already on shaky ground, in debt or in a tenuous leasing situation.\n\n“Things have to click for the brewery to be bringing in the revenue with visitors, with events,” he said. “One hiccup, one bad delivery, one missed equipment, one bad batch, and you can be at risk. People are getting by, but it’s not clear sailing right now.”\n\nChanges are brewing\n\nThis past weekend marked the final day of operation for Second Street Brewery at its namesake original location off 2nd Street in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Second Street had operated there for more than 25 years, but the lease renewal terms – including higher rent – were not favorable enough, said Rod Tweet, Second Street’s president and brewmaster.\n\nRod Tweet, Second Street Brewery's president and owner, with brewer Ben Murdock. Courtesy Mariah Cameron Scee\n\nWith two other taproom restaurants in the Southwestern arts hub, the company is “doing pretty solid business” and both breweries are “very busy,” Tweet told CNN Business. “We’re in pretty good health on the whole, but we pay attention to what’s going on around us, too.”\n\nThe company’s restaurant footprint was a little too big for post-Covid times, he said. Not to mention the extent to which the lingering, cascading economic pressures have created an uncertain business climate.\n\nThis now includes the ripple effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the price and availability of oil, food, lumber and other materials. The global crisis could put additional price and demand pressures on items used by brewers, such as wooden pallets and malted barley, Watson said.\n\n“It’s a good time to be super careful and super strategic because we’re facing rising prices in pretty much everything,” said Second Street’s Tweet. “We’re trying to think of where we want to be five years from now.”\n\nBeer as a path toward economic renewal\n\nDespite uncertainty, optimism is brewing in places like Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThat’s where local musician Kemet Coleman is teaming up with craft brewers Woodie Bonds and Elliott Ivory to open Vine Street Brewing in the city’s historic Jazz District. When Vine Street makes its debut in September – an opening date already pushed back because of supply chain and construction delays – it will be Kansas City’s first Black-owned brewery.\n\nColeman was inspired to start a brewery after getting a job at Kansas City’s venerable Boulevard Brewing nearly 10 years ago. He had also learned about the history of brewing in parts of Africa and the roles of Black women and female slaves in America’s early beer industry. Coleman said he sees the potential in not only introducing craft beer to new consumers and educating them about the different styles of beer, but also in economic renewal.\n\nFrom left to right: Woodie Bonds, Elliott Ivory and Kemet Coleman, founders of Vine Street Brewing, which will be Kansas City's first Black-owned brewery. Kemet Coleman/Vine Street Brewing Co.\n\nBreweries are “great community builders,” he said, noting that in downtown Kansas City he’s seen breweries emerge and development follow. Vine Street hopes to serve as a community gathering place and offer historical tours and host local musicians and events.\n\nIn the Jazz District, “some of our most important milestones and moments and spaces have either been demolished or haven’t really been taken care of,” he said. “So I see beer in general, but also this brewery specifically, as a way to help bring back a community to not former glory but to a new place that everybody would enjoy and would be proud to boast about.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/26/beer-london-britain-tax-hike-pint-pub/95443060/", "title": "Beer-loving Brits bitter over tax hike for a pricey pint at the pub", "text": "Benjamin Plackett\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nLONDON — Beer-loving Brits are heading to their local pubs for festive tipples as part of the holidays, even as many Londoners fume that their already pricey pint will cost still more in 2017.\n\nA new city tax hike on business that takes effect next year will rise from an average of about 10% to more than 12%, boosting the price of a pint by more than 40% in some pubs, according to business tax research firm CVS.\n\n“It does outrage me — the premium on a pint in London compared to buying it in a supermarket is already too high,” said Farhud Manzoori, 29, a trader for Nobel Group, as he sipped ale at the Roebuck pub in South London. “It means you have to use a £20 bill (about $25) to pay for two pints. It’s already too expensive.”\n\nAccording to the Good Pub Guide, the average cost of a pint in the United Kingdom tops $4, but in central London the price can creep past $6. Average prices in the U.S. are about the same, according to the website pintprice.com.\n\nManzoori and his friend Alex Hitter, 24, a graduate student, are tavern regulars and fear that the rising cost of a pint is another financial squeeze in one of Europe’s most expensive places to live. They call it an attack on a great institution.\n\n“The pub is the chief arena for socializing in the U.K.,\" Hitter said. \"It’s casual fun, but it still feels like you’re doing something despite basically sitting in a living room.”\n\nMaking ends meet is increasingly tough for owners of pubs, which are closing at a rate of 27 a week nationwide. London alone loses about 500 a year, as they fail to compete with trendy cocktail bars and cheap booze offers from supermarket chains, according to the Campaign for Real Ale.\n\nAt the same time, the United Kingdom has among the highest beer taxes in Europe, around 63 cents a pint.\n\nBrigid Simmonds, CEO of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the higher tax could force even more pubs to shutter their doors. “Independent pubs are going to find it difficult,” she said.\n\nSimmonds is pushing for the government to soften the blow by reducing the beer tax rate from what it is now, along with a rebate on business taxes for all pubs. “Pubs are important to local communities,” she said, “We think pubs should be treated differently.”\n\nSome pubs here that have been serving pints for centuries are at risk for the greatest tax increases because of their central locations, popularity and high sales. The revered, centuries-old Anchor, for example, has been a brothel, a tavern and a chapel. It sits on the south bank of the River Thames, just around the corner from the Globe Theatre, where William Shakespeare’s plays were performed. The bard himself was a regular drinker there, according to lore. But the pub will have to cough up an extra $182,000 a year when the new taxes begin.\n\nSimmonds said the increase also will hit tourists, who love going to British pubs. “We want you to keep on visiting but you may have to pay a bit for your pint,” she said.\n\nLeah Hardiker, 26, an accountant and a regular at the Anchor, isn’t prepared to accept that. “I come here quite a lot,\" she said, \"so it’s not good news.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/business/bud-light-next-launch/index.html", "title": "Bud Light's first-ever zero-carb beer hit shelves next week | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBud Light Next, the first zero-carb beer from Anheuser-Busch, is hitting shelves next week.\n\nThe new beer goes on sale nationwide February 7, about a week before the Super Bowl, traditionally one of the most popular days for beer consumption.\n\nAnheuser-Busch (BUD) is using the championship football game to help launch the new brand with an in-game ad that will “demonstrate what’s possible when there’s zero in the way.”\n\nBud Light Next is the “next generation of light beer for the next generation of beer drinkers,” said Andy Goeler, vice president of marketing for Bud Light. The new beer, announced last summer, is aimed at younger consumers like Gen Zers who are looking for a similar nutritional makeup to hard seltzer along with the flavor of beer.\n\nBud Light Next hits shelves on February 7. Courtesy Bud Light NEXT\n\nA 12-ounce serving of Bud Light Next is 4% alcohol by volume and 80 calories — that’s 30 fewer calories and about the same amount of alcohol compared to the original. But the big difference is in the carbs: Bud Light has 6.6 grams of in a 12-ounce serving, while Bud Light Next has zero.\n\nBud Light Next will be priced slightly higher than Bud Light. When Next hits shelves, consumers will see the hallmarks of typical Bud Light packaging like the blue-and-white color scheme to remind fans the brand is in the “Bud Light family,” Goeler said. The phrases “zero carbs” and “super crisp” are also prominent on the can.\n\nBeer bounces back\n\nBeer sales had been declining for much of the past decade, but the pandemic reignited consumer interest because of its affordability, brand familiarity and product innovations. NielsenIQ said that retail beer sales slipped 5.4% in 2021 compared to the year prior, perhaps not surprisingly since the pandemic triggered pantry stocking and sporting events and music concerts were largely canceled.\n\nRetail sales of light beers with a range of 0 to 5 carbs per serving, declined less than 1% in 2021, the firm said. That’s a smaller decline compared to the broader beer industry, making it an opportune category for growth.\n\n“It makes sense for alcohol companies to consider these trends when developing line extensions to keep core consumers engaged with their brands, and offer more choice for people looking for healthier options,” Brandy Rand, chief operating officer of the Americas at IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, told CNN Business.\n\nLaunching Next is “historic” for the nearly four-decade-old Bud Light brand, Goeler said. “We’ve been working on it for 10 years, and it wasn’t until recently that brewing technology gave us the breakthrough to brew a beer with zero carbs.” The brewer developed about 130 prototypes before landing on the correct recipe.\n\nCNN Business toured the Cartersville, Georgia, facility where Bud Light Next is being brewed. Jennifer Logan, senior general manager of the plant, declined to give details about how the zero-carb beer is made, but said it was a “highly technical process” and that water is “one of the most important raw materials” for brewing beer.\n\nLogan described the crisp taste as a mix between elderberry and chamomile, with a fruity aroma. “The body is very thin, as you would expect being a zero-carb beer,” she said.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky John General", "Jordan Valinsky", "John General"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/business/budweiser-slogan-origin/index.html", "title": "Budweiser's slogan wasn't always the 'King of Beers' | CNN Business", "text": "1.

Thousands of new US stores. A more reliable mobile app with new rewards. And enough new perks and benefits to perhaps dissuade employees from joining a union.\n\nThe news came Tuesday during the company’s investor day, when Starbucks (SBUX) leaders spent hours outlining what the next few years will look like.\n\n“We’re not reinventing what we do,” interim CEO Howard Schultz said Tuesday. “We’re just reinventing how we do it.” Schultz will remain in his position until incoming CEO Laxman Narasimhan officially takes the reins in April.\n\nSchultz introduced a broad-strokes version of the new plan in July via an open letter to employees, saying “the Starbucks business as it is built today is not set up to fully satisfy the evolving behaviors, needs and expectations of our [employees] or customers. It is not designed for the future we aspire to for ourselves and the communities in which we serve.”\n\nFaster Frappuccinos\n\nAn example of the Siren System setup, where a barista doesn't have to bend down to get ingredients. From Starbucks\n\nStarbucks has to catch up with its customers to accelerate growth. Over the years, the “business has changed dramatically,” Schultz said.\n\nCustomers are increasingly ordering through the company’s mobile app and drive-thrus. They’re opting for cold beverages, which now make up the majority of drink orders. Sometimes they also order TikTok-inspired concoctions so elaborate they make a grande iced vanilla latte seem like a simple black coffee.\n\nThese new consumer habits create complexity for employees tasked with preparing time-consuming recipes ordered in person, through an app or at the drive-thru. That means longer wait times for customers — if they decide to wait in line at all.\n\n“One of our challenges today is that we’re not able to meet the capacity of demand that is coming through our stores,” said Brady Brewer, chief marketing officer at Starbucks.\n\nMore efficient kitchens and new technology can help baristas work faster, easing those bottlenecks.\n\nOne of these improvements is called the Siren System, which among other attributes is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks. Faster blenders and new dispensers for ingredients like milk and ice are set up in a line, so baristas can prepare the beverage without bending down to reach for milk or whipped cream tucked under the counter.\n\nThe Siren System puts appliances above the counter, not below. From Starbucks\n\nBaristas spend about 36 seconds making a Frappuccino with Siren, down from about 87 seconds on average with the traditional system. Siren also uses ovens that can heat food in batches, rather than individually, to get food to customers more quickly. Some stores are already using the system as part of a test, but Starbucks plans to start rolling it out more broadly in 2024.\n\nThe company also discussed a new coffee machine Tuesday, which makes a freshly ground and brewed cup of decaf or regular coffee in about 30 seconds without paper filters. The machines should be in all US locations within the next three years.\n\nIn addition to improving its current locations, Starbucks plans to open 2,000 net new stores in the United States by 2025 — aiming to create a broad portfolio including drive-thru and delivery-only locations.\n\nMore rewards and better service\n\nThe tech improvements won’t stop in the kitchen. They’re also coming to the mobile app.\n\nMobile orders have become an important part of Starbucks’ business. The company had about 27.4 million active rewards members in the quarter ending in July, up 13% year-over-year. That’s great — when the app is working.\n\n“As many of you are aware, our mobile app has had a few brief outages over the past few months,” said Starbucks’ Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre on Tuesday.\n\nAbout a quarter of US sales come through digital channels, Lefevre noted. “Even a few minutes of downtime can mean … confusion in our stores and, of course, lost business opportunities,” she said. The company’s first priority is to make the app function reliably, she said: “Things just need to work.”\n\nStarbucks is planning other improvements as well, like allowing customers to use mobile ordering and collect rewards points when visiting a licensed Starbucks location. It’s also working on showing real-time order updates in the app, as well as a joint rewards program with other companies like retailers or airlines.\n\nAt the drive-thru, Starbucks is working on “a frictionless payment program that will automatically recognize and authenticate our customers as they pass through,” said Lefevre.\n\nStarbucks also said this week that it would allow rewards members to purchase or earn NFTs starting later this year.\n\n‘A trust deficit’\n\nThese tech upgrades, whether in cafe kitchens or payment systems, are designed not only to enhance customer service but to support workers.\n\nFor Starbucks, making employees happy is an important part of the plan as it fights the growing unionization effort. As of Tuesday, the National Labor Relations Board has certified votes to unionize at 224 Starbucks stores, and certified that 42 locations have voted against unionization.\n\nStarbucks has made clear it wants workers to deal with the company directly, rather than going through a third party.\n\n“We have a trust deficit with our partners,” said Frank Britt, Starbucks’ chief strategy and transformation officer, on Tuesday. “We have not lived up to the highest level of obligations,” he said. “We plan to do quite a bit about it.”\n\nTo that end, Starbucks said this week it will offer eligible employees support managing their student loan debt and help them establish savings accounts. Britt also said the company is working on giving workers more flexible scheduling options, with future plans including more generous sick time and additional mental health support.\n\nStarbucks has said it can only guarantee new benefits for non-union employees.\n\nBut Starbucks Workers United, which has been leading the campaign, remains unmoved by the company’s plan. The group organized a march outside of the company’s headquarters Tuesday to coincide with the investor event.\n\n“Workers are glad that Starbucks is taking an interest in issues related to our working conditions; we unionized because we would like to have a real voice in this process,” the group said in a statement about the investor meeting. “We look forward to negotiating over these conditions at the bargaining table.”\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to clarify that Starbucks can only guarantee new benefits for non-union employees.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/business/russian-vodka-boycotts/index.html", "title": "States want to boycott Russian vodka. Here's why that won't work ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRussian-made alcohol is the latest target in the growing backlash against the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSo far, officials in Ohio, Utah and New Hampshire have called on liquor stores to remove Russian-made or Russian-branded products from shelves, a move that largely targets vodka since it’s most closely associated with the country.\n\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox requested on Saturday that state-run liquor outlets “remove all Russian-produced and Russian-branded products,” explaining that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an “egregious violation of human rights.”\n\nNew Hampshire’s Gov. Chris Sununu made a similar announcement, also asking for the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits.”\n\nThese moves are largely symbolic — and may even miss their intended target — as very few brands imported to the United States still produce the liquor in Russia.\n\nMany of the top-selling vodka brands that trace their origins to Russia are now distilled in multiple countries — including the United States.\n\nFor example, some bar owners are protesting the invasion by dumping out Stoli Vodka. Problem is, it’s only Russian by name, which is loosely translated as “capital city” due to its origins in Moscow. The vodka is actually made in Latvia, and the company’s headquarters is in Luxembourg — a member of NATO which has spoken against the Russian invasion.\n\nRussian Standard is one of the few vodka brands that is actually Russian. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Stoli Group said it “unequivocally condemns the military action in Ukraine and stands ready to support the Ukrainian people, our teams and partners.”\n\n“For decades, Stoli Group has supported the marginalized and those at risk of unwarranted aggression. We stand now with all Ukrainians and Russians calling for peace,” a company spokesperson said.\n\nSmirnoff is another brand being confused as being Russian. Although it traces its heritage to 19th century Russia, the company has long been owned by British spirits giant Diageo (DEO) and is manufactured in Illinois.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine was more targeted with his announcement. On Saturday, he asked the state’s nearly 500 liquor stores to “cease both the purchase and sale of all vodka made by Russian Standard, the only overseas, Russian-owned distillery with vodka sold in Ohio.”\n\nRussian Standard, along with lesser-known vodka Green Mark, are one of the few alcohol brands imported from Russia and sold in the United States. It’s parent company, Roust International, is owned by Roustam Tariko, a Russian oligarch who also owns Russian Standard Bank. The alcohol company didn’t immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment.\n\nThese boycotts are largely symbolic because Russian-made vodka accounts for a very small percentage of the roughly $7 billion in annual vodka sales, according to the Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS), a national trade organization that represents spirits makers.\n\nLess than 1% of vodka consumed in the United States is produced in Russia. In fact, more than half of all vodka consumed domestically is actually made here, according to data from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, a global firm that tracks alcohol sales.\n\nVodka imported from Russia has been on the decline for several years, and is down 79% since 2011, DISCUS said.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/perspectives/recession-gdp-fed-inflation/index.html", "title": "Opinion: It's time to prepare for a recession - CNN", "text": "Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji are co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI). The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nThe economy is close to entering a recession, perhaps as soon as this year. To avoid taking too much of a financial hit, Americans will need to prepare.\n\nLast summer, we wrote that US economic growth was already starting to slow and the economy would keep decelerating in the coming months. That is already proving to be true, with year-over-year GDP growth declining from 12.2% in the second quarter of 2021 to 3.5% in the first quarter of this year. The Commerce Department commonly cites GDP growth as the annualized percentage change from one quarter to another, but those numbers tend to gyrate much more than the year-over-year figures. Nevertheless, both data points show the slowdown in economic growth between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAnd there is a toxic brew of external economic headwinds, including the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China , resulting in supply shocks that boost inflation and slow growth.\n\nA key part of the inflation problem is linked to the massive $3.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in 2020 and 2021, alongside well over a hundred billion dollars in bonds the Federal Reserve was buying each month since the height of the pandemic.\n\nOf course, when economic slowdowns take hold, it makes sense for the Fed to try and shore up economic growth by cutting interest rates. But in this case, the Fed is trying to make up for failing to react to inflation sooner. We warned last year that inflation was getting out of hand.

The drink, which also will be available in a zero-sugar option, is hitting shelves in Mexico later this year before expanding globally.\n\nThe combination brings together “two of the world’s most recognizable and valuable trademarks,” the companies said in a press release, and will include “clear responsibility symbols” to indicate the beverage is for legal-aged drinkers. It will typically have 5% alcohol by volume, but that will vary depending on country.\n\nThe canned cocktail is launching first in Mexico.\n\nBrown‑Forman CEO Lawson Whiting said that the partnership “brings together two classic American icons to deliver consumers a taste experience they love in a way that is consistent, convenient, and portable.” He added that the new drink will “accelerate expansion and continue to grow our business around the world.”\n\nMexico was picked as a launch market because both brands are popular there and the country has a well-developed ready-to-drink market, a Brown-Forman spokesperson told CNN Business. A US launch is intended for sometime in 2023.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) has been aggressively expanding its alcoholic drink options as the trend grows.

Vladimir Gerdo/TASS/Getty Images\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta said it would block access to Russian news outlets Sputnik and RT, the Russia-backed television network infamous for promoting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda, across the European Union.\n\nThe move comes after the company received “requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s VP of global affairs, wrote in a tweet.\n\nMeta has also said it has applied algorithmic restrictions on Russian state media that should prevent those posts from surfacing as prominently in users’ feeds.\n\nHitachi (HTHIY) said March 10 that it is pausing exports to Russia and suspending all manufacturing in the country, “with the exception of products, services and support for electrical power equipment that are indispensable to the daily lives of people,” it said.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate added that Russia accounts for just a small fraction — roughly 0.5% — of its revenue.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has suspended all business in Russia.\n\n“In Ukraine, we have been in constant touch with our local teams and continue to provide assistance that includes relocation and financial support,” Krishna said. “The safety and security of IBMers and their families in all areas impacted by this crisis remains our top priority.”\n\nIntel (INTC) said April 5 that it has suspended business operations in Russia. Earlier this year, the company said it stopped all shipments to Russia and Belarus.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) said it was suspending all new sales of its products and services in Russia.

The company has been operating in the Russian market for more than 30 years,” it said on March 7.\n\n“In light of the escalating war, the EY global organization will no longer serve any Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world.”\n\nConsulting and accounting firm KPMG International said that its “Russia and Belarus firms will leave the KPMG network.”\n\n“KPMG has over 4,500 people in Russia and Belarus, and ending our working relationship with them, many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades, is incredibly difficult,” the company said. “This decision is not about them – it is a consequence of the actions of the Russian Government. We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing.”\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is also planning to break away from its Russian business.\n\n“As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network,” the “Big Four” consultancy said in a statement.\n\n“Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts,” it added.\n\n“We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia.”\n\nEnergy and metals\n\nBP said it was planning to exit its 19.75% stake in Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, and suspending their joint ventures — which amount to one of the biggest foreign investments in Russia.\n\nEquinor will also begin to exit its joint ventures in Russia, the Norwegian oil and gas company announced.\n\n“We are all deeply troubled by the invasion of Ukraine, which represents a terrible setback for the world,” said CEO Anders Opedal.\n\nThe company said it had $1.2 billion in long-term investments in Russia at the end of 2021.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTotalEnergies (TOT) also condemned Russia’s actions and said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in the country.\n\nThe French oil giant has done business in Russia for 25 years, and recently helped launch a major liquefied natural gas project on the Siberian coast.\n\nFinance\n\nNorway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund will divest shares in 47 Russian companies as well as Russian government bonds, the Norwegian prime minister said.\n\nMastercard (MA) said it was suspending its network services in Russia. Cards supported by Russian banks will not work in the company’s network, and any cards issued outside of Russia will not work within the country.\n\nThe credit giant, which has operated in Russia for more than 25 years, had previously announced that it had “blocked multiple financial institutions” from its network as a result of anti-Russian sanctions, and would “continue to work with regulators in the days ahead.”\n\nVisa (V) said it is suspending all of its operations in Russia.

Employees will still be paid.\n\nBurger King said it is pulling corporate support from its businesses in Russia. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the burger chain, said it “has suspended all of its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that Burger King restaurants will be closed in Russia, however, as the company said the chain’s roughly 800 locations there are “fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.” This means that the company cannot simply pull the plug on those restaurants as other brands such as McDonald’s have done.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) said that it is “suspending its business in Russia.” The company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n\nHeineken will stop producing and selling beer in Russia.

Wait until this ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter noticing his electric bills rising earlier this year, Jason Bell opted to go on a budget plan so he could spread the cost over 12 months. He and his husband, Shane, figured that would help them get through the coming winter since their Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania, home is heated by electricity.\n\nIt didn’t turn out that way. The couple is now paying $472 a month on the budget plan, up from around $290 a month last winter. That prompted Bell to resume his part-time job as a police officer on top of his full-time position as a state dog warden. The increase, combined with rising costs for food and other essentials, has left Bell debating whether to take on another part-time gig.\n\n“The prices of everything have escalated to the point that a part-time job may not be enough to supplement the increases of bills that we have budgeted,” said Bell, 41, whose husband works as a certified nursing assistant while studying for his nursing degree.\n\nJason Bell may have to take on a second part-time job, on top of his full-time position, to afford his heating bills this winter. Courtesy Jason Bell\n\nLike Bell, many Americans are bracing for the cold reality that they will have to shell out even more to keep their homes warm this winter.\n\nFamilies are expected to pay an average of 17.2% more for home heat this coming season, compared to last winter, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That comes on top of a big price increase last winter, bringing the two-year hike to more than 35%.\n\nThose who heat with natural gas are facing the largest spike, with their cost for the winter heating season expected to soar 34.3% to $952, the association said.\n\nThe tab for heating oil is expected to jump 12.8% to $2,115. And those whose heat runs on electricity can expect to see a nearly 7% increase to $1,328.\n\nSome people may not realize that heating their homes will be costlier this winter, especially since gasoline prices had been falling for months.\n\n“In a lot of people’s minds, gasoline and home energy are the same,” said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director. “The surprise here is that the prices for heating fuels are going to be popping.”\n\nHigh energy prices\n\nEnergy prices are on the rise in part because of the repeated heat waves that baked much of the United States this summer. That forced utilities to draw down on their natural gas reserves, which are also used to generate electricity, compounding the strain on inventory levels that were already below historical averages.\n\nOil prices, which spiked last winter after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, are declining but are still higher than they were last year.\n\nDan Pfoltzer was paying his landlord $150 a month to cover the cost of oil in the small house he rents in Nassau, New York. But over the summer, knowing that oil prices were up, Pfoltzer increased it to $310 a month so he wouldn’t be hit with a big bill over the winter.\n\n“By the time this tank runs out, the money will be there for the next tank,” said Pfoltzer, 71, who lives alone and drives a school bus.\n\nStill, the increased cost means that he won’t be able to pay all of his other bills, including those stemming from cancer treatment a few years ago. To keep his oil usage as low as possible, he plans to turn down the thermostat a few degrees to 67 and bundle up if he’s cold.\n\nOn the coast of Maine, Dale Christensen, Sr. and his family are already planning to use electric blankets in their living room and bedrooms this winter in an effort to minimize their heating bills. The 53-year-old is also looking at buying space heaters.\n\nChristensen, a rural mail carrier, is already paying back his landlord for the $900 it cost to fill the oil tank when they moved into their rental house earlier this year. He’s expecting to receive a $1,300 bill later this fall to refill it for the start of winter and likely two more after that during the season.\n\nDale Christensen, Sr. expects his family will have to use electric blankets to keep warm this winter in Maine. Dale Christensen, Sr.\n\nHeat wasn’t an issue for the Christensens last winter because they lived in an apartment where it was included, though the couple had to make sure their elderly parents, who are on fixed incomes, stayed warm in their homes.\n\n“Every year, we worry about our parents for the heating costs,” he said. “This year is even more stress and strain because, of course, now we have to pay for our heat.”\n\nThe family has applied for aid from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, to defray part of the cost of their oil bill. But Christensen isn’t counting on it until he hears whether they are approved.\n\nLess federal assistance available\n\nMaking matters worse is there is far less money in LIHEAP’s coffers this year, even though roughly 20 million American households — or 1 in 6 families — are behind on their utility bills.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act, which Congress approved in March 2021, provided a $4.5 billion boost to the program for this fiscal year, on top of a $3.8 billion regular appropriation. The stimulus money was mainly used to reduce the pandemic-fueled spike in arrears.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are looking at providing a $4 billion appropriation for LIHEAP for fiscal 2023, though lawmakers have yet to approve the federal government funding bill for the coming year. The Biden administration has asked for an additional $500 million for LIHEAP on top of what lawmakers are considering, while the energy directors association has called for $5 billion more.\n\nRequests for help have been pouring in, even before the cold weather sets in, state energy directors say.\n\nAt this time last year, Energy Services Inc. in Wisconsin was getting a record 300 calls a day to its customer care center. Now, the nonprofit group, the main LIHEAP administrator in the state, is fielding more than 1,000 calls a day. A family of three making up to roughly $52,000 a year is eligible as long as funding is available.\n\n“The need hasn’t gone away. It’s accelerating at such a rapid pace,” said Timothy Bruer, Energy Services’ executive director, who noted that his group ran out of LIHEAP crisis assistance money in fiscal 2022 for the first time in three decades. “Keeping the heat and power on, which is a basic necessity, has become an unaffordable luxury for tens of thousands of Wisconsin’s most vulnerable, at-risk households.”\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Worcester Community Action Council typically doesn’t start receiving LIHEAP applications until the temperature starts to fall, said Mary Knittle, director of energy sources at the nonprofit group. But this year they’ve been coming in “fast and furious,” she said, noting that first-time applications for the upcoming winter are up 60% compared to this time last year.\n\nResidents are bracing for higher charges. One energy provider in the state just emailed its customers to inform them that electric bills will be an estimated $114 higher each month for average usage, compared to last winter — an increase of 64%, she said. It cited higher electric supply prices as the main reason.\n\nEven those who don’t heat with electricity will be affected since it typically takes electricity to run home heating systems.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is expecting to pay about 30% more to heat his home this winter. Courtesy Martin Silva\n\nAt the same time, Knittle will have far less money to distribute this winter, though the appropriation hasn’t been set yet. Last fiscal year, her agency received $24.6 million in LIHEAP funding, including a $13.9 million boost from the American Rescue Plan that has since been exhausted.\n\n“Anxiety is very, very high,” Knittle said, noting that a family of three making roughly $68,500 is eligible for help in Massachusetts.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is already hundreds of dollars behind on both his water and electric bills for the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, home he shares with his wife. He’s expecting it will cost around $130 a month for natural gas to heat their drafty, old house, up from roughly $100 last year.\n\nA dump truck driver, Silva hopes to repay his debts by cutting back even more on expenses, including trips to see his ill, elderly parents in New York City twice a month. But the mounting expenses have left him feeling “crushed.”\n\n“You can’t get ahead, no matter how hard you try,” said Silva, 51.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/opinions/may-9-putin-victory-war-nixey/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Expect Putin to make a big announcement on May 9 | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: James Nixey is the director of the Russia-Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, specializing in the relationships between Russia and the other post-Soviet states. He previously worked as an investigative reporter at the Moscow Tribune. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn May 9 – known as Victory Day in Russia – President Vladimir Putin will need to make a bombastic and very public display to suggest he is winning the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut more than two months in, the war is going far from how Russia originally envisaged. May 9, then, might present Putin the occasion to declare a symbolic “victory” over Ukraine – a great demonstration of patriotic ecstasy aimed at shoring up his manipulated, sanction-weary audience.\n\nThe date marks the day Nazi Germany surrendered to Soviet forces (the day after its capitulation to the Western allies, which is why the UK, US and their allies commemorate victory on May 8).\n\nMoscow initially partnered with Nazi Berlin to divide eastern Europe between the two totalitarian regimes. But after that partnership ended with the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, the Soviet human contribution to defeating Germany – backed by enormous shipments of food aid and military equipment from the UK, US and Canada – was critical.\n\nThe USSR lost tens of millions of soldiers and civilians in the course of the Second World War – many of them in the then-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nOver the entirety of his regime, Soviet-leader Joseph Stalin killed more people both in his own country and in occupied territories than Adolf Hitler. But these days it is a crime in Russia to recall this history, or to compare the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union with those of Nazi Germany. Fresh flowers are still placed on Stalin’s grave in Red Square – where the May 9 victory parade is held.\n\nHow important is May 9 to Putin?\n\nVladimir Putin is an ultra-nationalist who does not believe Russia’s territorial and political ambitions should end at its internationally recogniz​ed boundaries. The countries that used to make up the Soviet Union other than Russia are not considered sovereign by Russia – by most Russians in fact, and especially by Putin.\n\nBut with no friendly tools to attract other countries available, to retain or regain an empire Russia needs a powerful army. May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time (over the years, all secretaries-general of the Communist Party similarly stood on Lenin’s mausoleum on Red Square acknowledging Russia’s military might with satisfaction as it drove past and flew over).\n\nUkraine is deeply personal to Putin (but, fortunately, for the future of Ukraine, even more personal to Ukrainians). Its “waywardness” is a betrayal and its very existence an historical aberration, in the eyes of the Russian President. Something had to be done about Ukraine’s Western ambitions and as Russian style diplomacy (read: coercion) had failed, Putin felt forced to turn to more muscular methods to “restore rightness.”\n\nWhat he didn’t realize​ (although nor, to be fair, did most Western analysts) was how fundamentally corrupted and incompetent Russia’s supposedly modernize​d and professionalized fighting force had become.\n\nUkraine’s heroic resistance deserves every credit. But they couldn’t have achieved it without the Russians army’s inadvertent help. Meanwhile, such is the vertical nature of Russia’s political structures, there is surely little accurate information circulating among the rest of Putin’s elites on the state of play.\n\nWhat could this mean for the course of the war?\n\nIf Western analysts are correct that Putin has demanded victory by Victory Day, this means Russia’s military commanders need to achieve something – anything – after the humiliating defeats in the first two months of this war.\n\nThe attempt to take Kyiv was repelled, the Russian fleet’s flagship cruiser has been sunk by a country effectively without a Navy, and they have lost at least 15,000 soldiers – far more than in all previous post-Soviet campaigns (Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Ukraine 2014) combined.\n\nRussia’s Plan B (or more likely plan F or G) is to redouble efforts and ground forces and focus on taking more of Ukraine’s east; and hopefully for the Kremlin, but far less likely, the rest of the Black Sea seaboard.\n\nWhether this can be done in time for the May 9 parade is highly debatable. Ukrainians are still receiving weaponry and morale is high – although Kyiv controls the information surrounding the war and we do not know the real state of their armed forces. Its greatest challenge (from the east) is yet to come however, and the next few weeks will see intensified fighting as Russia tries to capture more land in Donbas.\n\nThe question remains, however, whether Moscow will seek to continue the offensive beyond its minor territorial gains or choose to “freeze” positions on the ground – dig into Ukrainian territory and sue Ukraine for peace as the war enters a new, more static, phase. Recent attempts to destabilize Moldova through its Russian-controlled breakaway territory Transnistria remind us that Moscow won’t give up so easily.\n\nBoth sides are effectively maneuvering for a better position at the negotiating table when that time eventually comes. In military terms, the war might be reaching a stalemate in the coming weeks, where neither side has sufficient force to completely change the tide of war and achieve a decisive victory over the other.\n\nWhat appears to be Putin’s strategy in Ukraine?\n\nRussia’s tactics may have changed, but its strategy – that is to say its overall goal – has not. That goal is to ensure that Ukraine is no longer an independent country able to make its choice to be European and westward-facing.\n\nThe good news is the objective cannot possibly be realized. Ukraine’s subjugation – physically or politically – is forever beyond Russia’s grasp now. Russia has not performed well enough on the battlefield or in the political arena to make it so. The bad news is that Russia does not yet know this and so will continue to send its own men, and far too many Ukrainians as well, to their deaths.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRussia does at least know that this is not solely a war against Ukraine, but against the rules-based international order, which it has not profited from. Russia has been saying this for over a decade. NATO knows this, too, but refuses to publicly recognize​ this to help prevent it from getting dragged in (discussions with NATO in private are a different matter).\n\nIf sanctions are maintained, Europe can continue to wean itself off Russian energy, and if foreign investors remain deterred, the Kremlin will run out of money later in the year – this in turn may dictate an eventual change of policy. But not by May 9. None of these changes will be visible by then – in the “progress” of the war or in the eyes of ordinary Russians.\n\nSo May 9 will be a show of strength as it always is. But it will be hollow. Just like, as I suspect, the feeling in the pit of Putin’s stomach.", "authors": ["James Nixey"], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2016/03/19/breaking-down-dps-rescue-plan/81871788/", "title": "Breaking down the DPS rescue plan", "text": "Lori Higgins\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDetroit Public Schools’ road to financial health will involve splitting the district into two, a shift in the way millage revenue is used and a hefty investment by the state.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it would work:\n\nThe current situation: DPS is projected to have an accumulated operating debt of $515 million by June 30. The district is in dire straits and is expected to run out of money by April 8 and be unable to pay its staff. A plan is winding its way through the Legislature to give DPS $50 million in immediate emergency aid.\n\nThe district's long-term outstanding liabilities amount to $3.4 billion, according to a Michigan Department of Treasury report. That includes the $515 million.\n\nThe challenges ahead for the new DPS\n\nThe big split: All of the plans for fixing DPS involve splitting the district into two. The old district would remain solely to collect millage revenue and pay off the district's debt. The new district, which would be called the Detroit Community School District, would educate students. The plan would cost the state about $715 million for per-pupil funding.\n\nThe millage now: The district's 18-mill non-homestead millage (which affects businesses and rental properties) and a 6-mill millage on commercial property currently brings in $71.5 million annually that goes to cover a portion of the district's per-pupil funding.\n\nHouse panel approves nearly $50 million for DPS\n\nWhat happens if legislation is passed: The per-pupil revenue from the millages would be shifted and used over the next 10 years to pay off much of the $515 million in operating debt and $200 million in start-up costs for the new district.\n\nThe state would step in and replace the per-pupil funding, providing the district with more than $71 million annually — from tobacco settlement revenue. The $50 million in emergency aid will come from this pot of money also if it is approved.\n\nDetroit parents, students hope for better\n\nThe $200 million: This is money that would be used for start-up and transition costs as the new district is launched. A breakdown of where that money would go:\n\n• $75 million for facilities (deferred maintenance, space consolidation, school/building closure-related costs).\n\n• $50 million in transition and working capital costs (academic and instructional support; technology, legal, human resources and financial costs; vendor continuity payments, and costs associated with grants).\n\n• $25 million for cash needed at the beginning of the school year to cover costs until state aid payments arrive in October.\n\n• $25 million to invest in key academic programs that have been neglected.\n\n• $25 million for other operating liabilities.\n\nWhat about the long-term debt?: The district would have about $2.9 billion left in debt, and a separate voter-approved millage would be used to pay off that debt.\n\nVoters, of course, would have to approve renewals of the millages the state will rely on to pay off DPS's debt. If the millages get voted down, though, the state could seek a judgment levy against property owners in the city.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/09/21/recession-likely-2023-economists-predict/10431678002/", "title": "Is a recession coming in 2023?

Yields dip on UK bond ...", "text": "Damian J. Troise and Stan Choe\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks on Wall Street soared to their first gain in more than a week as some calm returns to financial markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2% Wednesday for its best day in seven weeks. That snapped Wall Street’s longest losing streak since the coronavirus crash in February 2020.\n\nBond markets globally also relaxed after the Bank of England moved forcefully to get a budding financial crisis there under control. Treasury yields fell sharply, easing some of the pressure that has sent stocks down more than 20% on Wall Street this year.\n\nThe moves helped markets recover some of their recent losses triggered by turmoil in U.K. financial markets. After the government there announced a sweeping set of tax cuts, investors worried the attempts to goose the U.K. economy could push already high inflation even higher. That caused the value of the British pound to plunge and bond yields globally to jump.\n\nBear market still at play\n\nDespite Wednesday's rally, the U.S. stock market is still down more than 20% from its record set early this year and remains close to its lowest point since late 2020. Analysts say more turbulence is likely ahead as worries about a possible recession, higher interest rates and even higher inflation continue to hang over Wall Street.\n\nRecession ahead:A recession is now likely in 2023. Here's what could trigger a sharp downturn in the economy\n\nBears on the prowl:The Dow entered a bear market. Here's what that means for investing in stocks.\n\nUnderscoring those concerns, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly topped 4% Wednesday morning to touch its highest level in more than a decade. It's been on a swift surge along with other Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve jacks up short-term interest rates at the fastest pace in decades.\n\nRecession calls grow\n\nBy raising rates, the Fed is hoping to slow the economy enough to undercut the high inflation that's hammering the economy. But it risks creating a recession if it takes rates too high too quickly. Already, the housing industry has been hurt in particular as mortgage rates have jumped to their highest levels since 2008.\n\nA recession appears to be inevitable, according to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She points to several discouraging signals, including six straight months of contraction for an index of leading economic indicators. That hasn't happened since the beginning of the global financial crisis two recessions ago.\n\nInvestment giant Vanguard puts the chance of a U.S. recession at 25% this year and at 65% next year on expectations for the Fed to keep hiking rates and to hold them at high levels through 2023.\n\nOther market pressures\n\nBesides the worries about higher rates from the Fed and other central banks, a litany of other pressures on the market are also lurking.\n\nAmong them: Investors are worried that the stress caused by a huge run for the U.S. dollar's value against other currencies could make something crack somewhere in global markets. In Europe, tensions are rising even further amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with suspicions about sabotage to important natural gas pipelines the latest flashpoint. And profits for U.S. companies are under threat because of the slowing economy, high inflation and rising dollar.\n\nFor Wednesday at least, though, the market seemed to be focused more on relief than such worries.\n\n“Investors got a sense that maybe central banks blinked, or at least the central bank of England blinked. That has led to lower rates\" for longer-term U.S. bonds, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \"And that has helped push stocks higher.”\n\nFollowing the Bank of England’s bond-buying announcement, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury sank sharply to 3.70% from 3.95% late Tuesday.

Since March 8, Minneapolis teachers have been picketing for better pay and benefits, smaller classes and more student mental health services. They're not alone. From Minnesota to Illinois to California, teachers unions are actively on strike or preparing to have members walk off the job over many of the same demands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/02/28/math-scores-high-school-lessons-freakonomics-pisa-algebra-geometry/4835742002/", "title": "Math education: US scores stink because of how schools teach ...", "text": "American students struggle in math.\n\nThe latest results of an international exam given to teenagers ranked the USA ninth in reading and 31st in math literacy out of 79 countries and economies. America has a smaller-than-average share of top-performing math students, and scores have essentially been flat for two decades.\n\nOne likely reason: U.S. high schools teach math differently than other countries.\n\nClasses here often focus on formulas and procedures rather than teaching students to think creatively about solving complex problems involving all sorts of mathematics, experts said. That makes it harder for students to compete globally, be it on an international exam or in colleges and careers that value sophisticated thinking and data science.\n\nThere is a growing chorus of math experts who recommend ways to bring America’s math curriculum into the 21st century to make it more reflective of what children in higher-performing countries learn. Some schools experiment with ways to make math more exciting, practical and inclusive.\n\n“There’s a lot of research that shows when you teach math in a different way, kids do better, including on test scores,” said Jo Boaler, a mathematics professor at Stanford University who is behind a major push to remake America's math curriculum.\n\nStandardized tests:How many exams should kids have to take?\n\nHere are some ideas for improving it:\n\nStop teaching the ‘geometry sandwich’\n\nMost American high schools teach algebra I in ninth grade, geometry in 10th grade and algebra II in 11th grade – something Boaler calls “the geometry sandwich.”\n\nOther countries teach three straight years of integrated math – I, II and III — in which concepts of algebra, geometry, probability, statistics and data science are taught together, allowing students to take deep dives into complex problems.\n\nGeographic disparity:States with the best (and worst) schools\n\nIn higher-performing countries, statistics or data science – the computer-based analysis of data, often coupled with coding – is a larger part of the math curriculum, Boaler said. Most American classes focus on teaching rote procedures, she said.\n\nNext year, Boaler and a research team plan to recommend that California phase out the algebra-geometry pathway in favor of integrated math for all students – something she pitched to education leaders across the state.\n\nSome states, such as Utah, have made the switch. The Common Core academic standards, a version of which most states adopted, say high school math can be taught in either format.\n\nDoes Common Core work? Despite new standards and more testing, reading and math scores haven't budged in a decade\n\nThe move requires extra time and resources to train teachers. Georgia mandated high schools teach integrated math starting in 2008. After pushback from teachers and parents, it gave schools the option to go back to the old sequence in 2016. In one large survey, Georgia teachers said they didn’t want to specialize in more than one math area.\n\nThe podcast Freakonomics featured an episode in October about the peculiarities of America’s math curriculum. Hosted by University of Chicago economist Steve Levitt, it highlighted Boaler's work and garnered significant feedback, given the specificity of the topic, Levitt told USA TODAY.\n\nLevitt is engaged in the movement to upend traditional math instruction. He said high schools could consider whittling down the most useful elements of geometry and the second year of algebra into a one-year course. Then students would have more room in their schedules for more applicable math classes.\n\n“When you talk to people within the math education industry, they call that insanely radical,” Levitt said. “I think most parents would not consider it radical to teach only the best of two subjects that most people don’t like that much.”\n\nMake more room for data science\n\n“Ninety percent of the data we have in the world right now was created in the past two years,” Boaler said. “We’re at a point in this world where things are changing, and we need to help students navigate that new world.”\n\nOther countries act more quickly on that idea. Estonia students ranked first among European countries in mathematics, as well as reading and science, on the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment. Many factors may have helped: The country offers high-quality early childhood education to all kids, class sizes are small, and there's little high-stakes testing, leaving more time for instruction.\n\nUnlike other countries, Estonia teaches computer programming at all grade levels – a strategy started in the upper grades in the late '90s and extended to elementary schools around 2012. The country is experimenting with adopting a new computer-based math curriculum.\n\nComputer-based math:What it looks like, and why it's important\n\nIn the USA, about 3,300 students this year in 15 Southern California school districts are taking a new Introduction to Data Science course that features data and statistics, real-life data collection and coding to analyze the data. The course was developed by the University of California-Los Angeles and the LA Unified School District, and it counts as a statistics credit.\n\nThe class features a scripted curriculum with engaging exercises, such as having students record how much time they spend grooming themselves, then comparing that with national data collected for the American Time Use survey.\n\nTeachers are trained to teach the class, as many haven’t been exposed to programming before, said Suyen Machado, director of the Introduction to Data Science project.\n\nStudents who took the new course showed significant growth in their statistical understanding over the year, studies show. Students said they felt learning to code was a valuable skill.\n\n“A lot of students report that they find the content is more applicable to real life,” Machado said. “One of the more challenging things about the course is learning programming. They say it’s hard, but they want to do it.”\n\nStop splitting up students so much, and don’t hasten the curriculum\n\nOver the years, some schools have sought to raise math achievement by pushing algebra down to eighth grade. High-flying students may adapt and have room to take more advanced high school classes. Hastening the curriculum can widen the gulf in achievement between lower-performing students, including those who are economically disadvantaged and racial minorities.\n\nThe practice reflects a long-standing feature of American math education: As early as middle school, students are often split into \"tracks\" in ways that predetermine who will take advanced classes in high school. The advanced classes are often full of students who are white or Asian and attend suburban schools – while black and Latino students continue to be underrepresented, research shows.\n\nAbout six years ago, San Francisco’s school leaders sought to tackle the problem. They halted teaching algebra I in eighth grade. Students take the same three-year sequence of math courses in middle school, and everyone is enrolled in mixed-ability classrooms, said Lizzy Hull Barnes, math supervisor at the San Francisco Unified School District.\n\nIn high school, all students take ninth grade algebra and 10th grade geometry. After that, students can choose their path: Some may pick algebra II, others may choose a course combining algebra II and pre-calculus. Some may accelerate to AP statistics.\n\nBefore the change, 40% of graduating seniors in San Francisco had to repeat algebra I in their academic careers. For the Class of 2019, the first cohort of students to follow the new sequence, just 8% of students had to repeat the course.\n\nThe changes led to a major increase in disadvantaged students enrolling in higher-level math classes as juniors and seniors, Barnes said. Boosting the success of black and Latino students did not harm the progress of high-achieving white and Asian students.\n\n“It’s been a seismic shift,” Barnes said.\n\nIn New York, an uproar over axing gifted tracks:This school is doing it anyway\n\nChange the way elementary teachers think about math\n\nImproving the math aptitude of older students in the USA is connected to messages students hear about why math is important and who's good at it when they're younger.\n\nThose messages often come from their elementary school teachers, many of whom didn’t like math as students themselves.\n\n\"Math phobia is real. Math anxiety is real,\" said DeAnn Huinker, a professor of mathematics education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who teaches future elementary and middle school teachers.\n\nNew research suggests that when teachers improve their attitude toward math, it can help to raise student test scores. At Stanford, Boaler and her team designed an online course for teachers featuring research showing anyone can learn math with enough practice, intelligence isn’t fixed and math is connected to all sorts of everyday activities.\n\nThey recruited fifth grade teachers from a county in central California to take and discuss the course. Within a year, the participating teachers' students posted significantly higher state math scores compared with previous years. The jumps were particularly significant for girls and low-income students, Boaler said.\n\n“They thought they had to teach procedures, and then realized they could teach in this open, visual, creative way,\" Boaler said. \"A lot of research studies suggest that it takes a long time for changes to come about. In this one, it was quick.”\n\nMake high school math reflect real life\n\nBeyond data science, some districts design courses that include more real-world math and topics such as financial algebra and mathematical modeling.\n\nThe approach has led other countries to success. Teens in the Netherlands post some of the strongest math scores in the world on the PISA assessment. That's largely because the exam prioritizes the application of mathematical concepts to real-life situations, and the Dutch teach math rooted in reality and relevant to society.\n\nSome longtime Dutch math experts were involved in the design of PISA, which began in 2000 and is given every three years to a sample of 15-year-old students in developed countries and economies.\n\nAt Sweetwater High School in Chula Vista, California, math teacher Melody Morris teaches a new 12th grade course that explores topics such as two-player games, graph theory, sequences and series and cryptography. The course, called Discrete Math, was developed through a partnership with San Diego State University.\n\nIn one exercise, Morris teaches students to play a capture-the-flag style game featured on the television show \"Survivor.\" They learn that by using math, they can win every time.\n\n'Survivor: Winners at War':Previous champs compete in Season 40\n\n“Their typical response is: ‘This is math?’ ” Morris said. “They think it’s about playing games and having fun. But what they’re really learning is how to break down large problems into small ones and how to make hypotheses and test them.”\n\nStudents at Sweetwater still rise up through the traditional “geometry sandwich” from ninth through 11th grades. Morris said many who choose her class senior year find themselves much more engaged in the material. They develop a toolkit that will allow them to approach any problem in life, Morris said.\n\n“A lot of what we’re building is habits of mind,” she said.\n\nWho's best at tech and engineering?
