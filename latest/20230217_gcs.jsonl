Live updates after Wyoming primary ...", "text": "Rep. Liz Cheney said Wednesday she would decide on 2024 election plans over 'coming months.'\n\nHarriet Hageman, with Trump's backing, soundly defeated Cheney on Tuesday in Wyoming's GOP primary.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, former President Donald Trump's most prominent Republican critic, said she's intent on keeping him out of the Oval Office and may consider a presidential run herself.\n\nJust hours after her stinging defeat in her GOP primary in Wyoming, she said a 2024 campaign \"is something I’m thinking about and I’ll make a decision in the coming months.\" Cheney broke the news on NBC's \"Today.\" She did not mention party affiliation, and there has been speculation she could mount a campaign as an independent.\n\nAnalysts reacted with significant skepticism to the news, saying Cheney is unlikely to beat Trump or even be a viable independent candidate.\n\nIn the meantime, the three-term House lawmaker and vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee has her eyes on the 45th president: \"I believe that Donald Trump continues to pose a very grave threat – a risk to our republic – and I think defeating him is going to require a broad and united front of Republicans, Democrats and independents and that's what I intend to be a part of,\" Cheney said on \"Today.\"\n\nTrump, who backed Cheney's opponent Harriet Hageman, has teased a reelection campaign but has not officially announced he's running in 2024. He faces legal inquiries on many fronts, including an investigation related to classified documents removed last week from his Florida estate.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCheney has reorganized her campaign account, filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to create a leadership PAC called \"The Great Task.\"\n\nWith Cheney's loss, Trump's work to defeat the 10 House Republicans who voted for his impeachment in January 2021 was rewarded. Here's how those 10 have fared so far.\n\nIn Alaska's primary, incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski advanced to the general election, along with challenger Kelly Tshibaka. In the House race, Sarah Palin moved to the November election, along with challengers Nick Begich III and Mary Peltola.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, another possible 2024 contender, suggested while in New Hampshire on Wednesday that he would consider testifying in front of the Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating Trump's involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nCheney's timeline:How Liz Cheney went from Trump backer and GOP leader, to his fiercest critic and GOP outcast\n\nWyoming, Alaska primaries:Takeaways: Cheney loses to Hageman in Wyoming; Alaska's Murkowski and Palin advance to general\n\nWho is Rep. Liz Cheney?\n\nHere are some facts about Republican Rep. Liz Cheney:\n\nShe's the oldest child of former Vice President Dick Cheney and second lady Lynne Cheney.\n\nShe met husband Philip Perry at Colorado College. They have five children.\n\nShe used to work in the State Department and has a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nShe voted with Donald Trump 93% of the time while he was president, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nShe voted to impeach Trump in 2021 after the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nWho is Rep. Liz Cheney?:What are her political positions? Is she running for president? What we know.\n\nWould Cheney be a viable independent candidate?\n\nCheney has narrated the Jan. 6 hearings as its vice chair and narrated her failed House primary reelection campaign as a fight to save American democracy.\n\nShe said Tuesday night and Wednesday morning the fight is just beginning, and she is considering a presidential run to continue that work. Some voters and political analysts are wondering if Cheney would run as an independent, but the analysts agree it’s a rocky path and more arduous than even a doomed Republican primary bid would be.\n\n“At the end of the day she’d probably get a very small slice of the vote, and I think she’d probably hurt the Democrats more than the Republicans given her current standing,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the Crystal Ball, a political analysis newsletter at the University of Virginia.\n\nRepublican strategist Susan Del Percio said she doesn’t see a path for Cheney “or many others” as an independent in 2024.\n\nCheney wouldn’t have enough support among Republicans or Democrats to win nationwide, Del Percio said: “Democrats appreciate her standing up and respect that she did the right thing, but they’re not going to buy into her conservatism.”\n\nBerwood Yost, director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said Cheney is unlikely to attract Democratic votes in his battleground state but could help the party.\n\n“Liz Cheney voted 95% of the time with Republicans. A lot of Democrats respect what she’s done recently, but I don’t think they’d pick her in a head-to-head matchup with her, Biden and Trump,” he said.\n\nBut she could help Democrats win by pulling votes away from Trump, as Green Party candidate Jill Stein pulled votes away from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump defeated Clinton that year by about 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania, the state that helped him clinch the White House. Stein received about 50,000 votes in that Pennsylvania presidential election.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nGet political news in your inbox: Sign up here to receive OnPolitics\n\nCheney would face tough path in presidential GOP primary\n\nEven before she lost her Republican House primary Tuesday in Wyoming, political analysts forecasted the tough path Rep. Liz Cheney would face if she seeks the country’s highest office.\n\nFor months, the congresswoman has indicated she’s thinking about it. On Wednesday, she made that more of a reality by reorganizing her campaign finance account as a leadership PAC geared at preventing former President Donald Trump from reentering the Oval Office.\n\nOpinion:What to do now with 'hot mess' that is the GOP?\n\nBut if she intends to keep him out by running against him in a Republican presidential primary – for which neither Cheney nor Trump have announced a bid – she faces an almost-certain loss, multiple analysts told USA TODAY.\n\n“She could never, ever, ever, ever win a Republican primary,” said former Rep. Joe Walsh, who served in the House as a Republican from Illinois before Trumpism prompted him to leave the party. The base has become “radicalized” and “there’s no room for Liz Cheney in the party.”\n\nRick Wilson, co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said he doesn’t see the traditional conservative Cheney changing the party enough to be able to win it. “I don’t believe the Republican Party can be revived as long as Trump has an iron grip on it.”\n\nCheney has “ticked off” the core base of the party too much to win a primary, according to Republican strategist Susan Del Percio. “She is following a playbook that is true and good for the public commission and horrible politically.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nCheney avoids talking party affiliation\n\nAsked if she would rule out running as a third party candidate in 2024, Cheney told Politico, \"I really am not at all focused on that kind of specifics.\"\n\nCheney said her attention is on finishing her term in Congress, informing people across the country what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, and \"making sure people understand how dangerous it is to vote for, to support election deniers.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go look towards sort of what comes next after that,\" she said.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nPence says he'd 'consider' testifying before the Jan. 6 committee if asked\n\nAs Cheney repositioned herself for a potential national campaign after her loss in Wyoming, rifts within the GOP over former President Donald Trump were on display when former Vice President Mike Pence made an appearance in New Hampshire on Wednesday.\n\nPence, who is himself a potential 2024 presidential contender, said he would consider testifying before the Jan. 6 committee if asked. While Pence added many caveats and emphasized he had some constitutional concerns about appearing before the congressional committee, his remark was the latest example of Pence distancing himself from Trump.\n\n\"If there was an invitation to participate, I would consider it,\" Pence said in remarks at a New Hampshire event that were broadcast on NBC. Pence was speaking at the \"Politics & Eggs\" breakfast, an event that describes itself as a \"must-stop\" on the presidential campaign trail. New Hampshire plays a crucial role in the selection of presidential nominees since it holds its primary election early, right after the Iowa caucus that kicks off the nominating process.\n\n– Caren Bohan, Ella Lee\n\nPence testimony?:Former VP Mike Pence says he would 'consider' testifying before Jan. 6 committee if asked\n\nMurkowski leads Alaska Senate challengers\n\nAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski will get to seek another term, after advancing to the November general election on Tuesday.\n\nMurkowski’s challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, also advanced to November, where they both will be on a ranked-choice ballot in the fall after making it through the state's new nonpartisan primary system.\n\nMurkowski's wide base of Republicans, Democrats and independents could help her hold onto the seat for a fourth term.\n\nThe senator is the only member of her chamber who voted to convict former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial who is facing voters this year. Others have retired or are up for reelection in 2024 or later.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nPalin, Begich, Peltola advance in Alaska race for U.S. House seat\n\nBusinessman Nick Begich III, former Gov. Sarah Palin and tribal activist Mary Peltola will advance to the November general election for Alaska’s sole congressional district.\n\nThe three candidates are also competing in a special election to fill the seat until the end of the term of the late Rep. Don Young, who died earlier this year. Results from that vote will not be made available for days, as mail-in ballots are counted.\n\nBegich and Palin are Republicans; Peltola is a Democrat. The state’s nonpartisan primary system allows the top four vote recipients to move forward to the general election, regardless of their political party.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nCheney reorganizes her campaign account\n\nIn another sign she may be running for president, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., filed a form Wednesday morning with the Federal Election Commission to revamp her campaign account.\n\nThe account, which had about $7 million in it at the end of July, is now a leadership PAC called “The Great Task.”\n\nThe Great Task was the name of the final ad in Cheney’s failed reelection campaign and a phrase from former President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, which she referenced in her concession speech Tuesday night.\n\nThe change follows Cheney’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to fight against any reelection run from former President Donald Trump, who has his own leadership PAC called “Save America.” Trump used money in that fund to back Harriet Hageman, who defeated Cheney in the Wyoming primary.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nCheney to launch new organization\n\nRep. Liz Cheney will start an organization in the next few weeks to mobilize a unified effort opposing any election bid from former President Donald Trump and educating the American people about the ongoing threat to democracy, her spokesman Jeremy Adler confirmed to USA TODAY on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe new organization was first reported by Politico Playbook.\n\nCheney’s new group doesn’t have a name yet and is being formed as she considers a 2024 presidential run.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nCheney after defeat: 'Now the real work begins'\n\nOn Tuesday night, after conceding defeat to Hageman, Cheney told a crowd of supporters: “This primary election is over but now the real work begins.”\n\nCheney again denounced Trump for \"lies\" about the 2020 election, and indicated she would work against other Republican \"election deniers\" who are seeking offices across the country in this year's election.\n\nAt the time, Cheney did not allude to a presidential campaign of her own in 2024, nor did she discuss in detail her ongoing work on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigation.\n\n– David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-announcement-2024/index.html", "title": "Trump is on the defense as he prepares for expected 2024 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nShould Donald Trump announce his third presidential bid on Tuesday, as is widely expected, he will begin the next phase of his political career under siege.\n\nSeven years ago, the New York businessman entered the political fray on defense, working vigorously to cast himself as a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination to the incredulity of veteran political operatives and his primary opponents. This time, Trump takes the plunge as the party’s indisputable frontrunner, but once again, he finds himself in a defensive crouch.\n\nOn the brink of a campaign launch that elicits both enthusiasm and dread from different corners of his own party, Trump’s quest to return to the Oval Office could face untold obstacles in the months to come, even with his loyal base firmly intact. He has spent the days since the midterm elections fending off criticism from fellow Republicans over his ill-fated involvement in key contests, furiously lashing out at two GOP heavyweights who could complicate his path to the White House if they mount their own presidential campaigns, and fretting that he or associates could soon be indicted by federal investigators in two separate Justice Department probes.\n\nAides say Trump is hoping his early entry into the 2024 presidential primary will reframe the conversation away from Republican failures and inject a fresh dose of enthusiasm into a demoralized party amid GOP failures to capture Senate control and win a sizable House majority. Though the former president has been touting his 200-plus victories on Election Night, many of the Trump-endorsed Republicans who prevailed last Tuesday ran uncontested or were widely expected to win their contests, while several Senate candidates he endorsed in highly prized races failed to dethrone their Democratic opponents or flip open seats into the GOP’s column.\n\nMehmet Oz, Adam Laxalt and Blake Masters, three Republican Senate candidates who earned Trump’s support in their primaries, respectively lost to Democratic opponents in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. Meanwhile, Herschel Walker, a longtime Trump friend challenging Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, is headed to a December runoff after both failed to reach 50% support in Georgia.\n\nOn Saturday, CNN projected that Democrats will retain control of the Senate in the 118th Congress, an outcome that has fractured Republicans and left the party on tenterhooks as Trump readies his “big announcement.”\n\nNext targets\n\nTrump, who in the immediate aftermath of the midterms conceded that his party had suffered a “somewhat disappointing” outcome, has already moved on, settings his sights on winning a second term in Washington and attacking two GOP governors who could challenge his status as the party’s anchor in the months to come, Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.\n\n“I Endorsed him, did a very big Trump Rally for him telephonically, got MAGA to Vote for him – or he couldn’t have come close to winning,” Trump said of Youngkin in a Truth Social post last week.\n\nThree sources familiar with the matter said the former president believed Youngkin was supportive of comments his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, made during a Fox Business appearance last week. She told the network she would not support Trump if he runs for president a third time.\n\nResponding to repeated questions about Trump’s impending 2024 announcement, Earle-Sears said, “A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage, and the voters have given us that very clear message.”\n\nSears later declined to tell The Washington Post whether Youngkin knew prior to the interview that she planned to split from Trump, a detail that caught the former president’s attention, according to one of his aides.\n\n“If Glenn Youngkin decides to run for president, that’s his choice. But Team Trump will certainly mount a massive effort to win the Virginia delegates going to Milwaukee that is going to embarrass Youngkin,” said John Fredericks, a Virginia-based conservative radio host who chaired Trump’s campaigns in the state in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe former president’s criticism of Youngkin, whose 2021 gubernatorial bid he endorsed against former Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe, came on the heels of a spate of insults Trump launched against DeSantis, the popular Florida governor who has refused to rule out a 2024 campaign against the former president and increasingly appears to be laying the groundwork for one. In the span of one week, Trump went from introducing a disparaging new nickname for the Florida governor (“DeSanctimonious”) to heeding requests from Republicans to pare back his criticism of DeSantis in the home stretch before Election Day, to blasting out a scathing statement on the heels of DeSantis’ reelection, calling him “an average Republican governor.”\n\nDeSantis allies said they do not expect the Florida governor to engage at all with Trump’s bashing for as long as he can avoid it. In two press conferences related to Hurricane Nicole that DeSantis held after winning reelection by a 19-point margin, he did not mention the overall midterm results or take any questions. Notably, he has also avoided taking a victory lap on Fox News, which would undoubtedly inquire about Trump and 2024, after appearing frequently on the network while campaigning for reelection.\n\n“Trump rants for a couple of months. DeSantis throws some red meat during [Florida’s next legislative session] and then we have a primary around May,” said one DeSantis ally, describing his current posture\n\nAsked how long the governor can go without acknowledging Trump’s attacks, a second DeSantis ally responded simply, “A long time.”\n\nTrump’s bitter criticism of Youngkin and DeSantis, two rising Republican celebrities, was a stark reminder of the scathing brand of politics he brings to the campaign trail, without regard for how it might impact his own party. His first use of “DeSanctimonious” came just days before the Florida governor appeared on the ballot in his bid for reelection. And much to the chagrin of top Republicans, including some of Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, his Tuesday announcement comes as the party looks to prevent Senate Democrats from securing a 51-seat majority through the Georgia runoff.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of criticism and people saying, ‘Just focus on Georgia,’ but he figures there’s no point in waiting. If Herschel loses, he’ll be blamed for distracting from the runoff but if he wins, he doesn’t believe he will get any credit for energizing the base,” said a current Trump adviser.\n\nSome of Trump’s closest allies said Republicans should brace for a significant escalation in his attacks on rumored GOP challengers once he is a declared presidential contender, meaning he could ramp up his criticism of DeSantis, Youngkin or others while the party is fighting for Walker’s survival in Georgia.\n\n“Nobody should be surprised. This is how Trump does primaries,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who remains close to the former president. “The question you have to ask is whether this format can work for him again.”\n\nOf course, Trump has not been in a hotly contested primary since 2016, when he unleashed broadsides against more than a dozen-plus opponents with fury and vitriol that shocked some Republican observers but delighted a segment of the Republican primary electorate that would later evolve into his loyal base. Few Trump allies expect him to behave any differently in the months to come. Even if he remains the only declared candidate until others enter the fray next year, he will continue his preemptive blitz against perceived challengers.\n\n“Donald Trump will make sure every Republican candidate is well-vetted,” said a senior Trump aide.\n\n“No one’s going to get a free pass. It’s going to be brutal,” added the Trump adviser.\n\nOther obstacles\n\nThe likelihood that Trump will face primary challengers may be the least of his concerns at this juncture.\n\nWhile the former president maintains significant support from grassroots Republicans, some of the party’s largest donors have been meeting with other potential presidential hopefuls and signaling they may be interested in bankrolling alternative candidates. It’s a concern Trump allies are confronting head on as they privately explore ways to make the monstrous pile of cash he has raised since leaving office available to him as a presidential candidate. Billionaire Ken Griffin, who gave nearly $60 million to federal Republican candidates and campaigns in the 2022 cycle, told Politico in an interview last week that he would support DeSantis if the Florida governor tosses his hat into the ring for the 2024 GOP nod. Two other Republican donors who gave to Trump in 2016 and 2020 and requested anonymity for fear of retribution told CNN that they, too, were waiting to see what DeSantis decides to do, while one of them said they would also be willing to support former Vice President Mike Pence should he challenge his former boss.\n\n“One of our biggest challenges will be the fundraising component but I do think [Trump] has proved that he doesn’t need deep-pocketed donors, per se,” said a person close to Trump, noting the enduring strength of his small-dollar operation.\n\nTrump will also have to convince Republicans that he would be an asset at the top of the ballot in 2024 as opposed to an albatross for vulnerable candidates in tight races. That task comes amid a fraught intraparty debate over the GOP’s bruising midterm outcome, with some Republicans claiming Trump’s involvement – including an eleventh-hour 2024 campaign tease at a rally on the eve of Election Day – did more to hurt the party than help. Others have blamed party leaders for failing to articulate clear policy priorities, pointed to the party’s money gap against Democrats in key races, or lamented the bickering that unfolded all cycle between two of the party’s biggest campaign committees led by Florida Sen. Rick Scott and allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nSome Trump allies said the donor challenges, midterm outcome and questions about his stature has left a dearth of seasoned campaign operatives willing to join his next campaign. Though the president has told allies he wants to keep his operation lean, much like his 2016 presidential campaign, some have privately questioned whether it’s out of preference or due to recruitment troubles. CNN has previously reported that Trump’s likely campaign is expected to be helmed by three current advisers – Susie Wiles, Chris LaCivita and Brian Jack – with assistance from a group of additional aides and advisers with whom the former president is already familiar. Overall, his 2024 apparatus is expected to dwarf in comparison to his reelection campaign two years ago, multiple sources said.\n\nEither way, as Trump works to find his footing on the verge of a presidential campaign that could coast to the party’s nominating convention or encounter any number of unforeseen troubles, allies who have stuck by his side said they are ready for battle one last time.\n\n“Our team is accustomed to fighting tooth and nail. Team Trump is going to fight for the nomination,” said Fredericks.", "authors": ["Gaborr Steve Contorno", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that the court’s ruling affirmed that Trump is “not above the law.”\n\n“For years, he tried to stall and thwart our lawful investigation into his financial dealings, but today’s decision sends a clear message that there are consequences for abusing the legal system,” James said. “We will not be bullied or dissuaded from pursuing justice.”\n\nThe New York civil fraud probe revolves around whether the Trump Organization deliberately misstated the valuations of its real estate holdings in official documents for unlawful gain.

That’s a tidal shift from her position just three months ago.\n\nSeven people familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNN that her private conversations about another run now match her publicly enthusiastic persona, as well as the sentiments of President Joe Biden.\n\nThe first lady was still mostly skeptical as of early fall – “not a proponent,” as one person familiar with her thinking told CNN. But in the month since the November midterm elections, in which Democrats defied the fate of most parties of first-term presidents, friends noted a change.\n\nJill Biden is now “all in” on the idea, according to a person who works with the East Wing.\n\nEven though the last several weeks of high-profile events have left her “exhausted,” said another person, “she has begun to say the quiet part out loud.”\n\nAt a town hall the other day, for example, Biden empathized with parents and grandparents about holiday stress, lamenting the demands on her own time.\n\n“This time of year is busy, to say the least,” she said. “I know that you probably have holiday shopping to do, cards to address or cookies to bake. … It’s not easy, is it? Sometimes all these feel like a full-time job, on top of volunteering or organizing or your real full-time job.”\n\nAs soon as her remarks were over, she tagged out and let other speakers finish the event while she hustled to the next task.\n\nThe Biden family conversations about 2024 were supposed to be on track for Christmas, however, CNN has learned from three of the people familiar that the clan is not expected to be in the same place all at the same time this year, making convening for a debate or a consensus more complicated.\n\n“She’ll be at the White House for Christmas. They will be joined by members of their families,” said Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, who declined further comment on family discussions.\n\nThe West Wing has long been in “he’s running” mode, with a political operation for 2024 already in the works. It’s an apparatus that has had to get started out of necessity before an official announcement. “As the president has said, he intends to run for reelection and that is something both Dr. Biden and the family fully support,” a senior adviser to Jill Biden told CNN.\n\nRecent polling, however, suggests a large swath of the Democratic Party may not be eager to see the president run again. A new CNN poll shows 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they’d like to see someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in 2024 – similar to the percentage of Republicans and Republican-leaners (62%) who say they’d prefer to see their party nominate someone other than former President Donald Trump. At the same time, though, when pressed, a majority of Democratic-aligned voters with opposition to Biden as their party’s nominee say they would vote for him in a general election if he won their party’s primary.\n\nThe first lady, and she alone, has the full weight of kibosh; she can still stop what seems inevitable in a political calculus if she has concerns about her husband’s age or how another run would affect his legacy or their family. She has been a “no” vote on his higher office aspirations before – most notably in 2004, and again in 2015.\n\nAnother presidential campaign would mean more for her, too. Joe Biden’s reelection plan, if he runs, will depend heavily on his wife’s involvement. Her likability in purple and red states, as well as her own energy and endurance, are crucial to his game plan, said two people with insight into the 2024 campaign strategy. It was Jill Biden, not the president, who barnstormed more than a dozen states in the midterms, chalking up at least 39 appearances at fundraisers and speaking engagements to support candidates up and down the ballot. Asked if the first lady is prepared to hit the trail even harder for a 2024 bid, the senior Biden adviser told CNN, “She is ready and fully supportive.”\n\nBut heading into her holiday break, Biden is coming off a physically and emotionally taxing period, said those who know her. Though still leaning into the presumption a second term is in the cards, the last two weeks have nonetheless run her ragged with the obligatory duties that the often-introverted first lady finds most draining, sources close to her said.\n\nIn addition to the recent wedding of her granddaughter, and the administration’s first State Dinner, hundreds of invited guests have been streaming through the White House over the last several days for dozens of holiday parties. On Wednesday, Biden and the president hosted yet another large-scale social event, a formal dinner in the East Room of the White House, for African nation leaders and their spouses in Washington this week for a summit. Jill Biden was also charged with planning and hosting events for the spouses on Wednesday and Thursday, when a luncheon at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture will occupy a chunk of her day.\n\n“She still has laryngitis, and is hoarse,” said a source familiar with the first lady’s rigorous schedule, alluding to Biden’s noticeably altered voice at speaking engagements this week. “She had three back-to-back parties on Saturday alone.”\n\n“It has been a busy month,” said Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director, when asked by CNN about Biden losing her voice.\n\nThat voice is the most influential to her husband’s decision making and thus will have to be the loudest when the time does come for him to announce his plans for 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrive with Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff for a bill signing ceremony for the Respect for Marriage Act on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nFirst lady veto power\n\nJoe Biden is buzzing from Democrats’ midterm performance – they retained the Senate and held off Republicans from a red wave in the House – some improving economic data, successful Asia summits and the release of Brittney Griner. He is telling people he has what it takes more than ever to go up against Trump – or whoever the ultimate GOP nominee may be.\n\nThough more squarely in the “we’re doing it” corner than she was even three months ago, Jill Biden still considers whether her husband, now 80, is up for a bruising battle, according to those familiar with her thinking.\n\n“[Jill Biden] is the one more aware of how the last few years have affected Joe [Biden,]” noted a person with ties to the Biden family. “We – collectively, as a country – all know the age issue, sure. But she’s the one who is consistently able to analyze it.”\n\nThe senior Biden official said the first lady has “zero concerns” about the president’s schedule and stamina.\n\nJill Biden is also the tender of Joe Biden’s legacy. Like so many first ladies before her, she can look down the road to what’s coming, how ready her husband is for it and what the best-case scenario may be. For the last two years, whenever the topic of a second term arose, she spoke of it as an inevitability, said those who have spent time working with her. She would default to saying things like “after the reelect” or “in the second term.”\n\nBut a deeper analysis of what that would mean for Joe Biden’s legacy has only come more recently for the first lady, said others who have had more insight into conversations.\n\nLast month, Biden’s big birthday made him the first octogenarian president of the United States. Jill Biden, 71, doesn’t want that to be the marker that leads every article and analysis about her husband after he has departed the Oval Office, friends and associates said.\n\nShe wants his political successes – current and future – to supersede the image of a frail and aged commander in chief.\n\nBut she’s still uncertain how to shift that narrative in practice. “She is not convinced whether four more years will help or hurt,” said one of the people who know her, discussing the potency of the age issue.\n\nJoe Biden’s timeline for an announcement on his future might not wait for the first lady to reconcile the problem.\n\n“The president will make that decision. I expect it shortly after the holiday,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, at a Wall Street Journal summit earlier this month. “I expect his decision will be to do it.”\n\nThe president has teased an announcement for months now, publicly saying he intends to run for reelection, often adding in the next breath he will discuss it with his wife and family first.\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nJill Biden is keenly aware of the influence she has had on her husband’s political trajectory. And this decision, while perhaps easier for Joe Biden to make as an incumbent, is no less hinged upon the blessing of the first lady. Jill Biden, as “Nana” to her grandchildren and matriarchal keeper of normalcy and tradition, has her eye on what a second term could mean for them, said the people who know her.\n\n“She has always had one foot in Delaware, and she’s the one who thinks about every possible scenario that could play out for her family,” said someone who has known her for several years. As she crosses from “highly possible” into “certainty” territory for 2024, Biden is considering how the campaign could impact her son, Hunter Biden, who has long been a target of the president’s political opponents, and could face more investigations into his business dealings with a GOP-led House. She wants to mitigate as much as possible the strain a campaign could have on her children, and, by extension, her grandchildren, several of whom are either on the cusp of entering adulthood or already there. (With the exception of Hunter Biden’s son, Beau, who is 2.)\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAsked by members of the media a couple of weeks later over Thanksgiving – a holiday he spent with Jill Biden, Hunter Biden and his wife and son, and Ashley Biden, in Nantucket, Massachusetts – how those family discussions about 2024 were coming along, the president said they weren’t. “We’re not having any. We’re celebrating,” he responded.\n\nWith the clock on the 2024 announcement ticking, Jill Biden has one more shot at away-from-Washington alone-time with her husband, when she could wrap her head around what “all in” actually entails.\n\nThe couple heads to the warmer climes of St. Croix between Christmas and New Year’s; laying in the sun with a book is a favored activity for the first lady.\n\n“Well, I – my guess is – I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away for a week,” the president said at his November post-election news conference at the White House, where Jill Biden sat in the front row. “And my guess is it would be early next year we make that judgment.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}]}

It's still a good deal | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSuper Bowl commercials are more expensive than ever. But for advertisers, they’re a better deal than ever.\n\nNBC — which is broadcasting this year’s game — announced last week that it is sold out of Super Bowl ads, with multiple 30 second spots having sold for a record $7 million each.\n\nWhy would advertisers spend $7 million on one ad? Because it’s the Super Bowl — a broadcast that is still watched by roughly 100 million viewers, even as ratings for some other big sporting events are falling.\n\nNothing in the media world comes close to getting companies the exposure that the Super Bowl can. That’s increasingly important as the media landscape grows more fragmented, according to Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive turned media consultant.\n\n“The fractionalization of attention because of streaming and social media makes the Super Bowl more important than ever,” Crakes told CNN Business. “If you’re in business with the NFL and you’re advertising during the Super Bowl, you’re a real player.”\n\nCrakes added that there’s also examples of the big game “helping build brands.”\n\n“Think about a company like GoDaddy. GoDaddy invested in the Super Bowl for years, did a lot of crazy things to get attention inside it, and it helped their business,” he said. “I think it’s a great investment, even at this price tag.”\n\n“You’re getting close to $500 million”\n\nThe Super Bowl — and the ads that come with it — is also a great investment for networks.\n\nWe don’t know yet what NBC will make in terms of ad revenue for this year’s broadcast. However, it’ll likely be a sizable chunk of change, according to Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\n\n“You’re likely looking at about 70 ads, so you’re getting pretty close to $500 million in ad revenue from the game for NBC,” Calkins told CNN Business. “And that, by the way, is just during the game. That doesn’t count before the game, after the game and all of the other opportunities there are to run additional advertising.”\n\nFor example, last year’s Super Bowl notched $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue, according to research firm Kantar. That’s more than the World Series and NBA finals and second only to the Olympic Games, which take place over a span of weeks.\n\nKantar noted that this year’s game — which pits the Cincinnati Bengals against the Los Angeles Rams — is projected to surpass last year’s numbers. (NBC shares the Super Bowl rights with the NFL’s other TV partners every couple of years.)\n\n“$500 million is a lot of money for anyone, but in the world of media, Super Bowl spots are in a whole other level,” Calkins said. “That is why the NFL is such a valuable sports franchise, because there’s this ability to charge advertisers this much to be on these events.”\n\n“A lot of people watching the Super Bowl don’t really care about the game”\n\nTV is going through a rapid transformation because of the streaming revolution, but the NFL continues to be one of the ratings bedrocks for traditional networks.\n\nThe league’s viewership for the 2021 regular season was up roughly 10% overall from last year, bringing in an average of 17.1 million viewers per game.\n\nThat is the highest regular season average since 2015, according to the league, and comes at a time when ratings for other big live events — such as awards shows — are experiencing record lows.\n\nCalkins explained that for networks like NBC there’s “two big benefits” to being in business with the NFL and broadcasting the Super Bowl. The first is the surplus of ad revenue and the other is “NBC will use this opportunity to support the rest of their lineup” via promos before, during and after the game.\n\n“For NBC, the Super Bowl is an event that they can use to jump start the rest of their lineup as they go into the spring and the rest of the year,” he said.\n\nCalkins added that “a number of years ago, people said, ‘the Super Bowl is going to fade away. It’s getting unsustainable.’ It’s completely the reverse.”\n\n“The Super Bowl is more and more important because it’s a shared experience,” Calkins said. “And what’s interesting is a lot of people watching the Super Bowl don’t even really care about the game. They’re watching the ads.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/01/25/nfl-playoff-games-tv-ratings-skyrocketing/9214210002/", "title": "Thrilling NFL playoff games send TV ratings skyrocketing", "text": "The television ratings are in for this past weekend's NFL playoff games -- and they're almost as spectacular as the games themselves.\n\nAccording to Fox Sports, Saturday's prime-time thriller between the San Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers drew an average of 36.9 million viewers.

Lester Holt, the anchor of the “NBC Nightly News,” conducted the roughly 20-minute interview.\n\nOn Sunday we saw about three minutes of it, sandwiched into five hours of pregame show.\n\nSo where was the rest of the interview?\n\nAlready seen, on the nightly news and the “Today” show earlier last week. Patience is not a virtue when it comes to TV. This was more of a quick hit with the president, an in-and-out between fare like NBC’s Tony Dungy and Drew Brees reminiscing about their Super Bowl experience and a performance by the Chainsmokers — along with a lot of promotion of NBC shows, by way of “interviews” with their stars.\n\nSome of those were as long as Holt’s interview with Biden, seemed like.\n\nSuper Bowl pregame info:How to watch NBC's Lester Holt's Super Bowl pregame interview with President Joe Biden\n\nNo one expects a 20-minute interview during Super Bowl pregame\n\nLook, no one expects football fans to sit through a 20-minute interview with the president. That’s not why you tune in. (I didn’t tune in for a Chainsmokers performance, either, but I digress.) But Holt’s interview was awfully brief.\n\nOf course the desire to gin up interest in the interview-averse Biden is understandable. And there weren’t many surprises. But whatever news the interview did make — Biden is doing a “deep dive” on four candidates for the upcoming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, for instance — was already out there, courtesy of the lengthy excerpts we saw earlier last week.\n\nThe biggest story — Biden’s phone call with Vladimir Putin on Saturday, in which he warned the Russian leader against invading Ukraine — couldn’t be part of the pregame interview, though that’s through no fault of NBC or Holt. Holt’s interview took place on Thursday.\n\nSo maybe bring back at least some kind of live-interview element? George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s Super Bowl interviews were live. That retains some element of freshness.\n\nThe audience watching the Super Bowl pregame show is of course different, and certainly more eclectic, than the audience that watches nightly broadcast news reports or morning shows, though there’s doubtless crossover. If you have an exclusive you want to get it out in front of as many viewers as you can, as soon as you can.\n\nBut it also takes away from the feeling of exclusivity of the moment. It feels less special.\n\nFor instance, when Holt asked a pointed question about inflation and Biden began his answer with, “Well, you’re being a wise guy with me a little bit,” that was dramatic, the kind of thing that could break through in a Super Bowl pregame interview.\n\nExcept that we didn’t see it Sunday — NBC had already aired it on the nightly news.\n\nThis tactic isn’t peculiar to NBC. Networks often parcel out bits and pieces of big interviews and stories over their various platforms.\n\nAnd it’s not just news. The demand for instant gratification has seeped into everything. We just can't wait.\n\nFor instance, remember when people looked forward to Super Bowl commercials? Some people watch the game for the commercials, for which advertisers pay top dollar and whose production values typically reflect that.\n\nThere are still Super Bowl commercials, they’re still exorbitantly priced (some 30-second commercials reportedly cost as much as $7 million) and they’re also no longer all that surprising, because so many of them appear online in the days leading up to the game.\n\nThere goes the element of surprise. I was really looking forward to the trailer for “Nope,” Jordan Peele’s upcoming movie about which next to nothing is known. That was definitely something to look forward to.\n\nUntil I watched it on YouTube Sunday morning.\n\nHolt did a good job questioning Biden, framing questions in a football context\n\nAs for the interview, Holt did a good job in all the various chunks of interview. In the portion airing Sunday he framed questions about COVID-19 in a football context. (Many fans at SoFi Stadium for the game on Sunday won’t be wearing masks, Holt said — what would Biden say to people ignoring local mandates?)\n\nHe also got an intriguing quote out of Biden, when asking about the league’s lack of diversity among its coaching and management ranks, the subject of a lawsuit by former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores.\n\n“It just seems to me that it’s a standard that they’d want to live up to,” Biden said of the need for more diversity. “It’s not a requirement of law. It’s a requirement I think of just some generic decency.”\n\nThat’s good stuff. We could have used more of it on Sunday.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

A lot. And Greg Olsen ...", "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles put on a great show in Glendale at Super Bowl 57 Sunday.\n\nA ton of people watched it — an average of 113 million viewers, according to Nielsen. The number includes viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and on digital platforms (Fox and NFL properties).\n\nThe greatest number of people tuned in, not surprisingly, during Rihanna's halftime show — an average of 118.7 million viewers. Sunday's game was the most-streamed in history, Fox said, with an average of 7 million streams.\n\nAnd 182.6 million people watched all or part of the game. These are preliminary numbers; final figures will be available Tuesday. But there's no way around it: the Super Bowl was a massive hit.\n\nAnd if social media and punditry reaction counts (it does), many liked what they saw.\n\nThis is no surprise. The Super Bowl is typically the highest-rated TV broadcast in any given year; historically, nine of the 10 most-watched broadcasts were Super Bowls (the 1983 finale of “M.A.S.H.” comes in ninth place). In 2022, an average of 99.18 million viewers watched the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56.\n\nIt’s not just the Super Bowl. People are nuts for football. In 2022, 82 of the 100 highest-rated shows on TV were football games.\n\nIn addition to the boffo ratings, Twitter reactions to Fox’s broadcast were overwhelmingly positive — particularly the work of analyst Greg Olsen. His work improved throughout the season, but the Super Bowl is a massive stage. And he pulled it off without a hitch.\n\nGreg Olsen knows Tom Brady is coming: Why he's surprisingly chill about it\n\nOlsen's gusty reaction to the game's most controversial call\n\nParticularly impressive was his call on the game’s most controversial play, when officials called holding on Eagles defensive back James Bradberry. People went nuts over the call, which may have contributed to the Chiefs' win, even though after the game Bradberry admitted the infraction.\n\nNo matter whether you liked the call, you had to like Olsen’s strong reaction and his unwavering opinion, particularly with late-game pressure in the biggest TV event of the year, and disagreement from Mike Pereira, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL who works as a rules analyst for Fox.\n\n“I think on this stage,” Olsen said, “I think you let them play. … I don’t know, I think you let them play, finish this thing out. I don’t love that call, Mike.”\n\nField called into question:Concerns rise about Super Bowl 57 turf\n\nOlsen yelling at Jerick McKinnon in the finals minutes of the game\n\nThen, with less than two minutes left in the game, the Chiefs' Jerick McKinnon easily could have run for a touchdown. But one school of thought is scoring that quickly would have given the Eagles the ball back with too much time to score.\n\n“He’s got to get down!” Olsen yelled as McKinnon ran. “He’s got to get down!”\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nHow many people watched Super Bowl 57?\n\nAt 113 million viewers, the game wasn't the most-watched TV show ever, as a Fox executive mused it might be.\n\nBut it ain't bad.\n\nWhatever the case, 113 million is a huge number of people who watched the game, a thriller in which the Chiefs beat the Eagles 38-35 with a field goal in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter. And Greg Olsen's broadcast made the game even better.\n\nReturning home for Super Bowl:Sam Ponder came back for the game and these old school Phoenix restaurants\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is proof Fox should keep Tom Brady on the bench\n\nRemarkably, it was the first Super Bowl for Olsen and play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt.\n\nThere’s a chance it could be their last.\n\nOvershadowing the buildup to the game was Tom Brady’s retirement. Fox has signed Brady to a reported 10-year, $375 million contract to work as an analyst. You don’t pay someone record money to be on the B-team.\n\nOlsen has been a good sport about the whole thing, saying he knew what he was signing up for.\n\nStill.\n\nBrady said he will wait until the 2024 season to start calling games. If Olsen’s work for Super Bowl 57 is any indication, he should wait a little longer.\n\nJohn Madden showed him the ropes:This Arizona man makes the Super Bowl more than a 'show'\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

And there are still a number of unanswered questions.\n\nBut Kirby said the U.S. hasn’t seen any indication that points directly to the objects being part of China’s spy balloon program, even though they were shot down about a week after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the Atlantic coast. He said the Pentagon has ruled out the possibility that the objects were from the U.S. government.\n\nComplicating the search for more details, the U.S. has not yet retrieved debris from the objects shot down over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory and in U.S. airspace over Lake Huron because each is in remote areas with difficult conditions and two are in bodies of water.\n\n\"We’ll get them eventually but it’s going to take some time,\" Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Tuesday in Brussels.\n\nSome remnants of the Chinese spy balloon have been retrieved from about 50 feet of ocean off the coast of South Carolina.

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, had a measured tone Tuesday.\n\nMurkowski said she was \"angry\" last week about an incursion in American airspace, especially because her home state is the first line of defense to foreign adversaries China and Russia.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, she said she still has questions, but some may not be answered until data is retrieved.\n\n\"It's pretty tough conditions up north right now, and they're looking for a needle in a haystack – but it's probably worse.

While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/01/25/the-disposession-of-latoya-ammons/4892553/", "title": "The exorcisms of Latoya Ammons", "text": "This article was originally published on Jan. 25, 2014.\n\nA woman and three children who claimed to be possessed by demons. A 9-year-old boy walking backward up a wall in the presence of a family case manager and hospital nurse.\n\nGary police Capt. Charles Austin said it was the strangest story he had ever heard.\n\nAustin, a 36-year veteran of the Gary Police Department, said he initially thought Indianapolis resident Latoya Ammons and her family concocted an elaborate tale as a way to make money. But after several visits to their home and interviews with witnesses, Austin said simply, \"I am a believer.\"\n\nNot everyone involved with the family was inclined to believe its incredible story. And many readers will find Ammons' supernatural claims impossible to accept.\n\nBut, whatever the cause of the creepy occurrences that befell the family — whether they were seized by a systematic delusion or demonic possession — it led to one of the most unusual cases ever handled by the Department of Child Services. Many of the events are detailed in nearly 800 pages of official records obtained by The Indianapolis Star and recounted in more than a dozen interviews with police, DCS personnel, psychologists, family members and a Catholic priest.\n\nAmmons, who swears by her story, has been unusually open. While she spoke on condition her children not be interviewed or named, she signed releases letting The Star review medical, psychological and official records that are not open to the public — and not always flattering.\n\nFurthermore, the family's story is made only more bizarre because it involves a DCS intervention, a string of psychological evaluations, a police investigation and, ultimately, a series of exorcisms.\n\nIt's a tale, they say, that started with flies.\n\n'This is not normal'\n\nIn November 2011, Ammons' family moved into a rental house on Carolina Street in Gary, a quiet lane lined with small one-story homes. Big black flies suddenly swarmed their screened-in porch in December, despite the winter chill.\n\n\"This is not normal,\" Ammons' mother, Rosa Campbell, remembers thinking. \"We killed them and killed them and killed them, but they kept coming back.\"\n\nThere were other strange happenings, too.\n\nAfter midnight, Campbell and Ammons both said, they occasionally heard the steady clump of footsteps climbing the basement stairs and the creak of the door opening between the basement and kitchen. No one was there.\n\nEven after they locked the door, the noise continued.\n\nCampbell said she awoke one night and saw a shadowy figure of a man pacing her living room. She leaped out of bed to investigate, and found large, wet bootprints.\n\nOn March 10, 2012, Campbell said, the family's unease turned to fear.\n\n12-year-old levitates\n\nIt was about 2 a.m. Normally, Campbell, Ammons and her children would have been asleep, but they were mourning the death of a loved one with a group of friends.\n\nAmmons, who was in Campbell's bedroom, startled everyone by screaming, \"Mama! Mama!\"\n\nCampbell said she ran into her bedroom, where her then-12-year-old granddaughter and a friend were staying.\n\nAmmons and Campbell said the 12-year-old was levitating above the bed, unconscious.\n\nAccording to their account of events, Ammons and several others surrounded the girl, praying. Campbell said she remembers being terrified.\n\n\"I thought, 'What's going on?' \" Campbell said. \" 'Why is this happening?' \"\n\nEventually, Campbell said, her granddaughter descended onto the bed. The girl woke up with no memory of what happened, Campbell said.\n\nCampbell and Ammons said the people who were visiting that night refused to return.\n\nPossessed by demons\n\nCampbell says she remembers telling her daughter, \"We need help. We need to talk to someone who knows how to deal with it.\"\n\nCampbell and Ammons said they didn't know exactly what \"it\" was, but they believed it was something supernatural.\n\nThey called local churches, but most refused to listen.\n\nEventually, after listening to Campbell and Ammons talk about the house and visiting it, officials at one church told them the Carolina Street house had spirits in it. They recommended the family clean the home with bleach and ammonia, then use oil to draw crosses on every door and window.\n\nAt the church's suggestion, Ammons said she poured olive oil on her three children's hands and feet, then smeared oil in the shape of crosses on their foreheads.\n\nCampbell and Ammons also told The Star they reached out to two clairvoyants, who said the family's home was besieged by more than 200 demons. Their explanation made sense to Campbell and Ammons, they say, because it meshed with their Christian faith.\n\nThe best thing you can do is move, Ammons remembers the clairvoyants telling her. But moving wasn't an option for the cash-strapped family.\n\nInstead, Ammons said she took a clairvoyant's advice and made an altar in the basement.\n\nAmmons covered an end table with a white sheet, then placed a white candle and statue of Mary, Joseph and Jesus on it. She opened a Bible to Psalm 91.\n\nShe said she and another person donned white T-shirts and wound white scarves around their heads.\n\nAlso on a clairvoyant's advice, they burned sage and sulfur throughout the house, starting upstairs and working their way down. The smoke was so thick they could hardly breathe.\n\nAmmons drew a cross with the smoke.\n\nThe person she was with read Psalm 91 aloud as they moved through the house:\n\n\"You will not fear the terror of night,\n\nnor the arrow that flies by day,\n\nnor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,\n\nnor the plague that destroys at midday.\"\n\nAmmons said nothing odd happened for three days. Then, things got worse.\n\nThe family said demons possessed Ammons and her children, then ages 7, 9 and 12. The kids' eyes bulged, evil smiles crossed their faces, and their voices deepened every time it happened, Campbell and Ammons said.\n\nCampbell said the demons didn't affect her because she was born with protection from evil. She said she, and others like her, have a guardian who protects them.\n\nAmmons said she felt weak, lightheaded and warm when she was possessed. Her body shook, and she said she felt out-of-control.\n\n\"You can tell it's different, something supernatural.\"\n\nThe youngest boy, then 7, sat in a closet talking to a boy that no one else could see. The other boy was describing what it felt like to be killed.\n\nCampbell said the 7-year-old once flew out of the bathroom as if he'd been thrown, and a headboard once smacked into Ammons' daughter, causing a wound that needed stitches.\n\nThe 12-year-old would later tell mental health professionals that she sometimes felt as if she were being choked and held down so she couldn't speak or move. She said she heard a voice say she'd never see her family again and wouldn't live another 20 minutes.\n\nSome nights were so bad the family slept at a hotel.\n\nFinally, in desperation, they went to their family physician, Dr. Geoffrey Onyeukwu, on April 19, 2012. Ammons said she told him what they were going through, hoping he might understand.\n\nOnyeukwu told The Star it was \"bizarre.\"\n\n\"Twenty years, and I've never heard anything like that in my life,\" he said. \"I was scared myself when I walked into the room.\"\n\nHe said he would not speak in more detail unless Ammons had \"psychiatric clearance\" for the waiver of confidentiality she had signed.\n\nIn his medical notes about the visit, Onyeukwu wrote \"delusions of ghost in home\" and \"hallucinations.\" He also wrote \"history of ghost at home\" and \"delusional.\"\n\nWhat Ammons and Campbell say happened next also was detailed in a DCS report of a family case manager's interviews with medical staff.\n\nChaos erupted.\n\n'He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there'\n\nCampbell said Ammons' sons cursed Onyeukwu in demonic voices, raging at him. Medical staff said the youngest boy was \"lifted and thrown into the wall with nobody touching him,\" according to a DCS report.\n\nThe boys abruptly passed out and wouldn't come to, Campbell added. She cradled one boy in her arms; Ammons held the other.\n\nSomeone from the doctor's office called 911. Onyeukwu said seven or eight police officers and multiple ambulances showed up.\n\n\"Everybody was ... they couldn't figure out exactly what was happening,\" he recalled.\n\nPolice and emergency personnel took the boys to Methodist Hospital's campus in Gary.\n\nAmmons said hospital personnel laughed at her desire to anoint her sons in olive oil.\n\n\"I couldn't talk to them,\" she said, \"so I talked to God.\"\n\nThe boys woke up in the hospital. The older boy, then 9, acted rationally, but the youngest screamed and thrashed, Campbell said.\n\nShe said it took five men to hold him down.\n\nMeanwhile, someone called DCS and asked the agency to investigate Ammons for possible child abuse or neglect. The caller, who is not named in the DCS report, speculated that Ammons might have a mental illness. The person believed the children were performing for Ammons, and she was encouraging their behavior.\n\nDCS family case manager Valerie Washington was asked to handle the initial investigation. She gave the following account to police and in her intake officer's report:\n\nHospital personnel examined Ammons and her children and found them to be healthy and free of marks or bruises. A hospital psychiatrist evaluated Ammons and determined she was of \"sound mind.\"\n\nWashington interviewed the family in the hospital.\n\nWhile she spoke with Ammons, the 7-year-old boy started growling with his teeth showing. His eyes rolled back in his head.\n\nThe boy locked his hands around his older brother's throat and refused to let go until adults pried his hands open.\n\nLater that evening, Washington and registered nurse Willie Lee Walker brought the two boys into a small exam room for an interview. Campbell joined them.\n\nThe 7-year-old stared into his brother's eyes and began to growl again.\n\n\"It's time to die,\" the boy said in a deep, unnatural voice. \"I will kill you.\"\n\nWhile the youngest boy spoke, the older brother started head-butting Campbell in the stomach.\n\nCampbell grabbed her grandson's hands and started praying.\n\nWhat happened next would rattle the witnesses, and to some it would offer not only evidence but proof of paranormal activity.\n\nAccording to Washington's original DCS report — an account corroborated by Walker, the nurse — the 9-year-old had a \"weird grin\" and walked backward up a wall to the ceiling. He then flipped over Campbell, landing on his feet. He never let go of his grandmother's hand.\n\n\"He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there,\" Walker told The Star. \"There's no way he could've done that.\"\n\nLater, police asked Washington whether the boy had run up the wall, as though performing an acrobatic trick.\n\nNo, Washington told them. She said the boy \"glided backward on the floor, wall and ceiling,\" according to a police report.\n\nWashington did not respond to The Star's requests for comment.\n\nBut she told police she was scared when it happened and ran out of the room. As for Walker, Washington said, \"he ran out of the room with me.\"\n\n\"We didn't know what was going on,\" Walker told The Star. \"That was crazy. I was like, 'Everybody gotta go.' \"\n\nAccording to Washington's report, they told a doctor what happened. The doctor, who did not believe them, asked the boy to walk up the wall again.\n\nWalker said he told the doctor he doubted the boy could repeat the feat. \"This kid was not himself when he did that,\" Walker said.\n\nThe boy said he didn't remember what happened and couldn't do it, according to Washington's report.\n\nWalker, who said he previously believed in demons and spirits, thought the boy's behavior had \"some demonic spirit to it\" but also was the result of a mental illness.\n\nA police report quoted Washington saying she believed there could be an \"evil influence\" affecting the family.\n\nSeparated\n\nAmmons said she spent the night at the hospital with her 7-year-old son while Campbell took Ammons' daughter and older son to a relative's home in Gary.\n\nThe next day was Ammons' youngest son's eighth birthday. Ammons said DCS officials asked Campbell to bring the older children back to the hospital, presumably to talk more about what happened.\n\nThe family celebrated the boy's birthday by singing and eating a miniature cake. Then, Ammons said Washington told them the children wouldn't be going home.\n\nDCS took the emergency step of taking custody of the children without a court order.\n\n\"All of the children were expericing (sic) spiritual and emotional distress,\" Washington wrote in the DCS form.\n\nAmmons told The Star she and her children cried because they didn't want to be separated.\n\n\"We'd already been through so much and fought so hard for our lives,\" she recalled. \"It was obvious we were a team, and we were beating it — whatever we were fighting. We made it through together as a team, and they separated us.\"\n\n'It must be scared of me'\n\nThe Rev. Michael Maginot was leading Bible study in his living room the morning of April 20, 2012, when he received a call from a hospital chaplain.\n\nMaginot had been the priest at St. Stephen, Martyr Parish, in Merrillville for more than 10 years but had never received a request like this one — the chaplain asked him to perform an exorcism on Ammons' 9-year-old son.\n\nMaginot agreed to interview the family after Sunday Mass a few days later.\n\nThe first step, Maginot said, was ruling out natural causes for what Ammons and her family said they were experiencing.\n\nHe visited Ammons and Campbell in the Carolina Street home April 22, 2012. For two hours, Ammons and Campbell detailed the phenomena for him. Then, Campbell interrupted the interview to point out a flickering bathroom light.\n\nThe flickering stopped each time Maginot walked over to investigate — which he attributed to a demonic presence.\n\n\"It must be scared of me,\" he later told The Star he had thought.\n\nThe interview was interrupted again when Campbell pointed out Venetian blinds in the kitchen swinging even though there was no air current. Maginot said he also saw wet footprints throughout the living room.\n\nAmmons complained about having a headache. Maginot said she convulsed when he placed a crucifix against her head.\n\nAfter a four-hour interview, Maginot said he was convinced the family was being tormented by demons. He said he also believed there were ghosts in the house.\n\nMaginot blessed the house before he left — praying, reading from the Bible and sprinkling holy water in each room.\n\nHe told Ammons and Campbell to leave because it wasn't safe. They temporarily moved in with a relative.\n\nGary police captain starts to believe\n\nBut less than a week later, the two women were back on Carolina Street to let Washington, the DCS family case manager, check the condition of the home. Washington asked a Lake County police officer to come with her.\n\nTwo other officers, one each from Gary and Hammond police departments, asked to join them out of \"professional curiosity.\"\n\nAmmons refused to go inside, but Campbell agreed to accompany the group. Ammons' kids still were in DCS custody.\n\nThe main floor had three bedrooms, a living room, one bathroom, hardwood floors and a small, open-style kitchen. A door in the kitchen led to a basement with concrete floors.\n\nDirectly under the stairs was a dirt floor. The concrete around it was jagged, as though it had been broken.\n\nThe makeshift altar Ammons had created was still in place, along with rings of salt she had poured against the basement walls to \"dissuade the demons,\" according to a Hammond Police Department report.\n\nCampbell told officers that demons seemed to emanate from beneath the stairs.\n\nAustin, the Gary police captain, was one of those officers. He later told The Star he believed in ghosts and the supernatural but said he didn't believe in demons.\n\nAustin said he changed his mind after visiting the Carolina Street house.\n\nDuring the interview with Campbell, one of the officer's audio recorders malfunctioned, according to Austin and Hammond police records. The power light flashed to indicate the batteries were dying, even though the officer had placed fresh batteries in the recorder earlier that day.\n\nAnother officer recorded audio and, when he played it back later, heard an unknown voice whisper \"hey,\" according to Lake County police records.\n\nThat officer also took photos of the house. In one photo of the basement stairs, there was a cloudy white image in the upper right-hand corner. When an officer enlarged the photo, that cloud appeared to resemble a face, Lake County police records state. The enlargement also revealed a second, green image that police say looked like a female.\n\nAustin said photos he snapped with his iPhone also seemed to have strange silhouettes in them. The radio in his police-issued Ford malfunctioned on the way home.\n\nLater, Austin said the garage at his Gary home refused to open, even though the power was on everywhere else.\n\nAustin said the driver's seat in his personal 2005 Infiniti also started moving backward and forward on its own.\n\nHe said he had the car checked at a dealership, and the mechanic told him the motor on the driver's seat was broken, which the mechanic said could have caused a distraction leading to an accident.\n\nAustin said he found himself starting to believe Ammons' claims of paranormal activity. But the mental health professionals evaluating Ammons and her children remained skeptical.\n\nDCS outlines case plan\n\nIn April 2012, DCS petitioned Lake Juvenile Court for temporary wardship of the three children. The request was granted.\n\nDCS found that Ammons neglected her children's education by not having them in school regularly. The agency made the same finding in 2009, its records show.\n\nAmmons told Washington there were times she could not send the kids to school because \"the spirits would make them sick, or they would be up all night without sleep.\"\n\nDCS temporarily placed her daughter and older son at St. Joseph's Carmelite Home in East Chicago. Ammons' youngest son was sent to Christian Haven in Wheatfield for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nClinical psychologist Stacy Wright, who evaluated Ammons' youngest son, said the boy tended to act possessed when he was challenged, redirected or asked questions he didn't want to answer. In her evaluation, Wright wrote that he seemed coherent and logical except when he talked about demons.\n\nIt was then that the 8-year-old's stories became \"bizarre, fragmented and illogical,\" Wright said. His stories changed each time he told them.\n\nHe also changed the subject, quizzing Wright on math problems and asking her about outer space.\n\n\"Can you die if you go to space?\" he asked. \"How do you get to space? Do you have to wear a helmet and suit?\"\n\nWright believed the 8-year-old did not suffer from a true psychotic disorder.\n\n\"This appears to be an unfortunate and sad case of a child who has been induced into a delusional system perpetuated by his mother and potentially reinforced\" by other relatives, she wrote in her psychological evaluation.\n\nClinical psychologist Joel Schwartz, who evaluated Ammons' daughter and older son, came to a similar conclusion.\n\n\"There also appears to be a need to assess the extent to which (Ammons' daughter) may have been unduly influenced by her mother's concerns that the family was exposed to paranormal experiences,\" Schwartz wrote.\n\nAmmons' daughter told Schwartz that she saw shadowy figures in the Carolina Street home. She also said she twice went into trances. Ammons' older son told Schwartz that \"doors would slam and stuff started moving around.\"\n\nAmmons also was examined several times by psychologists, who said she was \"guarded,\" but did not seem to be \"experiencing symptoms of psychosis or thought disorder.\" One psychologist recommended Ammons be assessed to \"determine whether her religiosity may be masking underlying delusional ideations or perceptual disturbances.\"\n\nAmmons — and all three kids — continued to insist they were possessed by demons.\n\nDCS set goals for the family. One of them stipulated that the children \"not discuss demons and being possessed and ... take responsibility for their actions.\" They also needed to participate in therapy to address past behavior.\n\nWhile DCS officials credited Ammons for sharing a \"close bond\" with her children, the agency also said she needed to use \"alternate forms of discipline not directly related to religion and demon possession,\" according to DCS' case plan. Appropriate discipline included encouragement, rules and withholding privileges. She could work on those goals during supervised visits with the children.\n\nAmmons also had to find a job and appropriate housing \"due to the paranormal activity\" at the house on Carolina Street.\n\nWhile Ammons worked on meeting those objectives, police and DCS officials continued to investigate strange happenings in the house.\n\nA demonic presence\n\nThe group was a bit larger this time.\n\nCampbell, Ammons, Austin and the two other police officers from the initial visit went back to the Carolina Street home on the afternoon of May 10, 2012. The police officers visited after work hours.\n\nThey were joined by Maginot, two Lake County officers with a police dog and DCS family case manager Samantha Ilic.\n\nIlic, who was there in an official capacity, told The Star she volunteered to go in Washington's place because Washington didn't want to go back to the house.\n\nA county officer took his police dog around the home, but the dog didn't show interest in any particular area, according to Lake County police records. Everyone else headed into the basement.\n\nIlic touched some strange liquid she saw dripping in the basement, and said it felt slippery yet sticky between her fingers.\n\nMaginot told police he wanted to check the dirt under the stairs for a pentagram or personal objects that might have been cursed. He said a pentagram might indicate a demonic presence and possible portal to hell, according to a Lake County police report.\n\nOr if someone had died in the house and was buried under the stairs, it could explain paranormal activity, Maginot added.\n\nOne of the police officers dug a 4-foot by 3-foot hole beneath the stairs, unearthing a pink press-on fingernail, a white pair of panties, a political shirt pin, a lid for a small cooking pan, socks with the bottoms cut off below the ankles, candy wrappers and a heavy metal object that looked like a weight for a drapery cord, police records state.\n\nFinding nothing else, the officer replaced the dirt and raked over it.\n\nMaginot blessed some salt, which he said is a barrier to evil, and spread it under the stairs and throughout the basement.\n\nIlic said she was later standing in the living room with the rest of the group when her left pinky finger started to tingle and whiten. She complained it felt broken.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, Ilic said she felt as if she was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe, so she walked outside to wait for the group.\n\nWhen the priest started questioning Ammons inside the house, she complained of a headache and shoulder pain, according to police records. She joined Ilic outside.\n\nAustin said he left the house at nightfall. Austin — who has been shot at and has investigated murders, rapes and armed robberies during his more than three decades on the force — said he wasn't staying in the house past dark.\n\nThe other officers continued to walk through the home. On the main floor, they noticed an oil-like substance dripping from venetian blinds in a bedroom but couldn't figure out where it was coming from, police records state.\n\nTo make sure Campbell or Ammons hadn't poured oil on the blinds, two of the officers used paper towels to clean it off. The officers sealed the room for 25 minutes and stood nearby so no one could walk in.\n\nWhen they went back in, the oil had reappeared, according to police records.\n\nMaginot told police the liquid was a manifestation of a paranormal or demonic presence.\n\nHe wrote a report detailing his findings and asked Bishop Dale Melczek's permission to perform an exorcism on Ammons.\n\nAn exorcism\n\nMaginot said Melczek had never authorized an exorcism in 21 years as bishop of the Diocese of Gary.\n\nDebbie Bosak, director of communications for the diocese, said she cannot comment on whether Melczek has ever approved an exorcism for confidentiality reasons. In general, she said, such an action would require a bishop's approval.\n\nMelczek initially denied Maginot's request to do a church-sanctioned exorcism, Maginot said. The bishop told Maginot to contact other priests who have performed exorcisms.\n\nMaginot said he needed other priests to give him the ritual for a minor exorcism, which does not require church approval. The priests he consulted told him to look it up on the Internet.\n\nHe said he did an \"intense blessing\" on the Carolina Street home to expel bad spirits.\n\nThat same day, Maginot performed a minor exorcism on Ammons. The ritual consisted of prayers, statements and appeals to cast out demons.\n\nTwo police officers and Ilic, the DCS family case manager, attended the ritual.\n\nIlic said she left believing that something was going on, although she wouldn't go as far as saying it was demonic. She said she got chills during the nearly two-hour rite.\n\n\"We felt like someone was in the room with you, someone breathing down your neck.\"\n\nIlic said she had a string of medical problems after visiting the home. A week after she visited the house for the last time, Ilic said she got third-degree burns from a motorcycle. Within 30 days, she also broke three ribs Jet Skiing, broke a hand when she hit a table, then broke an ankle running in flip-flops.\n\n\"I had friends who wouldn't talk to me because they believed that something had attached itself to me,\" Ilic said. Her joking response: \"I'm already evil. They try to find something that's not evil and corrupt it. They wouldn't waste their time on me.\"\n\nI cast you out, unclean spirit\n\nAfter the minor ritual, Maginot told Ammons to look up the names of demons that were tormenting her. Each demon has a name and personality, Maginot said.\n\nA name has power, the priest added, and he planned to use those names to fight the demons during the exorcisms.\n\nAmmons said she and a friend looked up the demons' names online by searching for demons that represented the problems the family had been having. The computer kept shutting down. She said she felt sick, lightheaded.\n\nBut she said they found names that fit.\n\nOne such name was Beelzebub, lord of the flies, Ammons said. She said they also found names of demons that torture and hurt kids, which she felt explained what happened in the Carolina Street house.\n\nAmmons said other high-ranking demons also were assigned to her, including lieutenants and sergeants.\n\nAfter the minor rite, Maginot said Bishop Melczek gave him permission to exorcise Ammons. The ritual is the same as the minor exorcism but more powerful because it has the backing of the Catholic Church, Maginot said.\n\nMaginot ultimately performed three major exorcisms on Ammons – two in English, and the last one in Latin – in June 2012 at his Merrillville church.\n\nDuring each, Maginot said, he praised God and condemned the devil.\n\nHe pressed a crucifix against Ammons' head as he spoke.\n\nI cast you out, unclean spirit,\n\nalong with every Satanic power of the enemy,\n\nevery spectre from hell,\n\nand all your fell companions;\n\nin the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nMaginot said his voice continued to get louder and more forceful until the demon weakened. He said he could tell how strong the demon was by how much Ammons convulsed.\n\nTwo police officers, who had kept in touch with Maginot since the home investigation, stood nearby in case Ammons needed to be restrained.\n\nAmmons said she prayed with Maginot until it became too painful.\n\nShe said she felt as if something inside her was trying to hold on and inflict pain at the same time. She said it was different from a natural pain but felt as intense as giving birth.\n\n\"I was hurting all over from the inside out,\" she remembered. \"I'm trying to do my best and be strong.\"\n\nEventually, Maginot said, Ammons fell asleep. She said that was the demon's way of lessening the ritual's effect.\n\nNo more nightmares\n\nIn between the second and third exorcisms, Maginot said he went on a retreat. A woman who assisted Maginot with some of the exorcisms helped set up a backup plan in case Ammons had problems while Maginot was gone.\n\nThe woman wrote a long demon name — Maginot said he can't remember which one it was — on a piece of paper and tucked it in an envelope, then she surrounded it with blessed salt.\n\nIf Ammons had problems, the woman would burn the envelope, Maginot said.\n\nBy this time, Ammons and her mother had moved to Indianapolis, but they drove back for the exorcisms and court hearings, as her children were still in DCS' care.\n\nMaginot said he blessed the family's new home to prevent more problems.\n\nBut Ammons called while Maginot was on his retreat, complaining of bad dreams, so the woman burned the envelope. She saved the ashes to burn later in a church bonfire.\n\nAfter that, Ammons said, her nightmares ended.\n\nReunited: 'I hadn't been that happy in God knows how long'\n\nIn the final exorcism at the end of June 2012, Maginot said he prayed and berated the demons in Latin, rather than English.\n\nPolice officers did not attend, so Maginot said his brother stood guard. Maginot said Ammons convulsed while he condemned the demons but did not convulse during prayer.\n\nWhen she fell asleep, he said words of thanksgiving.\n\nIt would be the last time Ammons saw Maginot. She and her mother drove back to Indianapolis, where they say they now live without fear.\n\nAmmons' old home on Carolina Street became an object of local curiosity — so much so that the owner and landlord, Charles Reed, called the Gary Police Department to ask officers to stop driving by the house because it was scaring his new tenant.\n\nHe said there were no problems in the home before or after Ammons and her family lived there.\n\n\"I thought I heard it all,\" said Reed, who's been a landlord for 33 years. \"This was a new one to me. My belief system has a hard time jumping over that bridge.\"\n\nWhen told of the Catholic Church's involvement in the situation, however, Reed said that made him \"less skeptical.\"\n\nAmmons regained custody of her three children in November 2012, about six months after they'd been removed. DCS continued to check in on the children and make sure they were going to school until the case was closed last February.\n\nAmmons called her children's return the happiest day of her life.\n\nShe said they screamed and jumped up and down when she picked them up from the DCS office in Gary.\n\n\"It was just awesome,\" Ammons said. \"I hadn't been that happy in God knows how long.\"\n\nThe children said they felt safe after they left the house on Carolina Street, the family said. The three left their demonic voices and complaints behind them.\n\n\"No demonic presences or spirits in the home,\" DCS family case manager Christina Olejnik wrote in team meeting notes dated Jan. 10, 2013. She did not return calls from The Star seeking comment.\n\n\"The family is no longer fixated solely on religion to explain or cope with the children's behavior issues,\" Olejnik and her supervisor wrote in a request for dismissal of wardship dated Jan. 24, 2013.\n\nFor her part, Ammons said it was not the psychologists who resolved her problems but God.\n\n\"When you hear something like this,\" she said, \"don't assume it's not real because I've lived it. I know it's real.\"\n\nCall Star reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski at 317-444-6135.

Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/senate-race-rankings-may-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year’s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall – Ohio, where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him – in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nTrump’s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him – the candidate’s past criticism of Trump.\n\nThe former President’s backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, but she’s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\n\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn’t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania, but it didn’t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\n\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden’s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they’re facing.\n\nCNN’s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans’ favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nPennsylvania – a state Biden won in 2020 – has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn’t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has Trump’s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie – with a margin close enough to trigger the state’s automatic recount process.\n\nCounties need to finish recounting – which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation – by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\n\nOz has declared himself the “presumptive” nominee, following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President’s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. “I like Trump … but not his Senate pick,” voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\n\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn’t enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\n\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump’s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount – and what that means for the general election. Oz’s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\n\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to “take on Washington,” coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke, leaving him in the hospital on election night.\n\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who’s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating “Trump Republicans” in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\n\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats’ road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it’s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\n\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump’s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State’s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won’t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump’s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state’s Senate seats.\n\n3. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May’s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President’s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that’s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters. It doesn’t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\n\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year – $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn’t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general – he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role – and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump’s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it’s time for a change in Washington.\n\nLaxalt first faces a primary on June 14. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is on the air attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who’s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump’s backing in his own recent spot.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House – such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\n\nLuckily for Kelly, the messy Republican primary field won’t be sorted until August. So while he’s facing attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he doesn’t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It’s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who’s been a target of the former President’s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by Peter Thiel, who was also behind Trump’s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given his differences with the group over the Ohio Senate primary.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Ron Johnson finally stepped up his fundraising – he brought in about $6 million in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He’s been running positive spots, featuring families who say their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson’s support for so-called Right to Try legislation.\n\nThat’s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular – 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase “cares about people like me” did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\n\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\n\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn’t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field – upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu’s decision not to seek the nomination – develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state’s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire’s late primary in September.\n\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu’s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration’s plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nOne of Trump’s earliest Senate primary endorsements – for US Rep. Ted Budd last June – resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\n\nThe Trump endorsement didn’t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. “Pat’s a nice guy, but he’s no conservative,” Robinson says, admitting that he’d voted for McCrory in the past “but not this time.” McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is “weak” on a host of issues.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. “Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,” she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won’t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio’s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\n\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won’t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio’s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden’s decision to rescind Title 42. Demings’ team recently said she does not support lifting the measure “until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.”\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe first major test of Trump’s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance, who received Trump’s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\n\nVance’s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it’s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\n\nStill, missing out on Trump’s endorsement didn’t stop the jockeying among some other candidates (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in an open spat with Trump, ran more clips of Vance’s past criticism of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said “they love Trump,” questioning the former President’s judgment on endorsements past and present.\n\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party’s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nSaul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt’s still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri – does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump’s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri – a red state that shouldn’t otherwise be competitive – remains on this list.\n\nConcerns about Greitens deepened in March after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was physically abusive toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having resigned as governor amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents have called on him to drop out. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory.\n\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn’t said how much she’ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win – while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/us/idaho-student-killings-timeline/index.html", "title": "A timeline of the killings of four University of Idaho students", "text": "CNN —\n\nA suspect was taken into custody in connection with the investigation into the killing of four University of Idaho students in November in an off-campus home in Moscow, two federal law enforcement sources confirmed to CNN on Friday.\n\nDuring a news conference on Friday, Moscow Police Chief James Fry confirmed the arrest of 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, on a warrant for the murders of the four students.\n\nHe said the suspect resides in Pullman, Washington, and is a graduate student.\n\nThe name of the suspect was confirmed to CNN earlier on Friday by a federal law enforcement source as well as a court source in Pennsylvania, where records show Kohberger was arrested and arraigned Friday morning. The arraignment was in Monroe County, in the Pocono Mountains, a state official said.\n\nPolice have been tight-lipped over the course of nearly seven weeks since the killings, which prompted investigations by the FBI, state police and Moscow police.\n\nFry acknowledged frustrations from the victims’ family members and Idaho residents who were anxious for more updates during the course of the investigation.\n\n“This was a complex and extensive case. We developed a clear picture over time …and be assured that the work was not, the work is not done,” Fry said.\n\nAuthorities have provided some information on the killings during the course of the investigation, and a preliminary timeline reveals how those killed spent some of their final hours, as well as the investigative response.\n\nSaturday, November 12\n\nKaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle were students at the University of Idaho who lived at a nearby off-campus residence in Moscow, a college town of about 25,000 people.\n\nThey had two other roommates in the three-floor, six-bedroom apartment.\n\nGoncalves posted a series of photos on her Instagram at some point with the caption, “one lucky girl to be surrounded by these ppl everyday.” One of the photos shows Mogen sitting on Goncalves’ shoulders, with Chapin and Kernodle standing next to them.\n\nClockwise from bottom left: Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle From Kaylee Goncalves/Instagram\n\nThat night, Chapin and Kernodle went to a party on campus, and Mogen and Goncalves went to a downtown bar, police said.\n\nSunday, November 13\n\nMogen and Goncalves ordered at a late-night food truck at about 1:41 a.m., the food truck’s live Twitch stream shows.\n\nThey ordered $10 worth of carbonara from the Grub Truckers and waited for about 10 minutes for their food. As they waited, they could be seen chatting with each other and with other people standing by the truck.\n\nThe two students did not seem to be in distress or in danger in any way, said Joseph Woodall, 26, who manages the truck.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows two University of Idaho victims at food truck on night of killings 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nChapin and Kernodle are believed to have returned home around 1:45 a.m., and Goncalves and Mogen used a private party for a ride home at about 1:56 a.m., according to police.\n\nOne of the surviving roommates, identified in court paperwork as “D.M.,” told investigators she “heard crying” in the house the morning of the murders and heard a voice say “it’s ok, I’m going to help you.”\n\nShe then saw a “figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person’s mouth and nose walking towards her,” the affidavit said.\n\n“D.M. described the figure as 5’10” or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built with bushy eyebrows. The male walked past D.M. as she stood in a ‘frozen shock phase,’” court documents reveal.\n\n“The male walked towards the back sliding glass door. D.M. locked herself in her room after seeing the male,” the document says, adding the roommate did not recognize the male.\n\nStatements by “the surviving witness and other evidence leads investigators to believe the homicides occurred between 4:00 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.,” according to court documents.\n\nThe two roommates at the home who were not injured woke up later in the morning and summoned friends to the home because they believed one of the victims had passed out and was not waking up. A call to 911 was made just before noon about an unconscious person at the residence, police said.\n\nArriving officers found the door to the residence open and discovered the bodies of four fatally stabbed students.\n\n“It was a pretty traumatic scene to find four dead college students in a residence,” Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt later told CNN affiliate KXLY.\n\nThere was no sign of forced entry or damage, police said.\n\nOfficers investigate a homicide at an apartment complex south of the University of Idaho campus on November 13. Zach Wilkinson/The Moscow-Pullman Daily News/AP\n\nPhone records indicate Kohberger’s phone was near the quadruple murder scene between 9:12 a.m. and 9:21 a.m. – hours after Kohberger allegedly killed the university students, court documents say.\n\nMoscow Police issued a statement saying four people were found dead in a home off campus. University of Idaho President Scott Green announced the four victims were students and canceled classes Monday.\n\nMonday, November 14\n\nMoscow Police issued a statement identifying the four homicide victims as Chapin, Goncalves, Kernodle and Mogen.\n\nPolice said details were limited and no one was in custody. They added Moscow police did “not believe there is an ongoing community risk based on information gathered during the preliminary investigation.”\n\nMoscow Mayor Art Bettge released a statement calling the deaths “senseless acts of violence.” Bettge said only limited information could be shared without “jeopardizing the integrity of the investigation.”\n\nGreen issued a statement offering condolences to the victims’ families and the community.\n\n“Moscow police do not believe there is an ongoing community risk based on information gathered during the preliminary investigation, however, we ask our employees to be empathetic, flexible and to work with our students who desire to return home to spend time with their families,” he said.\n\nTuesday, November 15\n\nMoscow Police issued a statement saying an “edged weapon such as a knife” was used in the killings. No suspects were in custody and no murder weapon had been found, police said.\n\n“Also, based on information from the preliminary investigation, investigators believe this was an isolated, targeted attack and there is no imminent threat to the community at large,” police said.\n\nLater in the day, police released another statement, attempting to calm fears of a killer on the loose.\n\n“We hear you, and we understand your fears,” police said. “We determined early in the investigation that we do not believe there is an ongoing threat for community members. Evidence indicates that this was a targeted attack.”\n\nWednesday, November 16\n\nMoscow Police Department Chief James Fry speaks November 16 during a news conference in Moscow, Idaho. City of Moscow\n\nPolice Chief Fry held a news conference – the department’s first in the case – and reiterated there was no suspect. He also backtracked on the assurances of no one at risk.\n\n“We cannot say there’s no threat to the community,” Fry said. “And as we have stated, please stay vigilant, report any suspicious activity and be aware of your surroundings at all times.”\n\nTwo other roommates were home at the time of the attack and were not injured, Fry said.\n\n“There was other people home at that time, but we’re not just focusing just on them, we’re focusing on everybody that may be coming and going from that residence,” he said.\n\nFriday, November 18\n\nFive days after the murders, Kohberger received a new license plate for his white Hyundai Elantra, court documents citing licensing documents Washington State licensing records reveal.\n\nThe Washington State Department of licensing provided CNN a redacted copy of a vehicle record which included a license plate number matching what is described as the new license plate in the court documents.\n\nDetectives by then had conducted 38 interviews with people “who may have information” about the killings and had taken the contents of three dumpsters near the house in case they held evidence, they said.\n\nInvestigators also asked local businesses if there had been any recent purchases of a “fixed-blade knife,” according to the police update.\n\nInvestigators released a map depicting the movements of four University of Idaho students the night they were murdered. Moscow Police Department\n\nHoping for tips from the community, investigators released a map and timeline of the victims’ movements. The map shows the four students spent most of the night separated in pairs.\n\nThe victims were “likely asleep” before they were attacked, police said.\n\n“Most definitely someone somewhere has a tidbit of information that will help break this case open and we believe the public around here will have that information for us,” Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell said.\n\nThe victims were found on the second and third floors of their home, Snell told CNN.\n\nMabbutt, the coroner, told CNN she saw “lots of blood on the wall” when she arrived at the scene. She confirmed there were multiple stab wounds on each body – likely from the same weapon – but would not disclose how many wounds nor where most were located.\n\nSaturday, November 19\n\nAuthorities spent about two hours at the crime scene as a part of the investigation.\n\n“We’re trying to expedite everything that might possibly lead to a suspect,” said Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson, who was there.\n\n“I wish we had more answers, and they’re still asking questions,” Thompson said.\n\nSunday, November 20\n\nOne week after the bodies of the four students were discovered, authorities still had no suspect or weapon, Moscow Police Capt. Roger Lanier said.\n\nPolice had fielded 646 tips and conducted more than 90 interviews, Police Chief Fry said at a news conference.\n\nFry declined to identify who placed the 911 call from the home where the students were slain, saying only the call came from the phone of one of the surviving roommates. He wouldn’t confirm which one placed the call.\n\nThere were other “friends that had arrived at the location,” Fry said, adding the person who called 911 is not a suspect.\n\nTuesday, November 22\n\nMoscow Police said they have looked extensively into information suggesting Goncalves had a stalker, but they have not been able to verify or identify one.\n\nFriday, November 29\n\nA Washington State University officer located a 2015 white Hyundai Elantra registered to Kohberger in an apartment complex parking lot, and officials were able to zero in on Kohberger because his driver’s license information and photograph were consistent with the roommate’s description.\n\nWednesday, November 30\n\nMoscow Police release a list of people who they believe are not involved in the crime, including the two surviving roommates, a man in the Grub Truck surveillance video, the private party driver who took Goncalves and Mogen home, the man Goncalves and Mogen called numerous times the night they were killed and any person at the home when 911 was called.\n\nA series of comments from law enforcement officials added further confusion to the investigation.\n\nThompson, the Latah County prosecutor, said at least one of the victims was “undoubtedly targeted” in the attack.\n\nSoon after, Moscow Police said they spoke with Thompson and affirmed his comments were a miscommunication. “Detectives do not currently know if the residence or any occupants were specifically targeted but continue to investigate,” police said, appearing to backtrack on earlier statements.\n\nPolice then had to further clarify they believe the attack was indeed “targeted,” but investigators have not concluded if the target was the residence or its occupants.\n\nMonday, December 5\n\nRegarding Goncalves’ possibly having a stalker, police said investigators identified an incident in October in which two men were seen at a business and one man appeared to follow Goncalves inside and as she exited to her car. The man did not make contact with her.\n\nInvestigators contacted both men and learned they were trying to meet women at this business. Detectives said they believe this was an isolated incident and not a pattern of stalking and said there was no evidence to suggest the men were involved in the killings.\n\nWednesday, December 7\n\nPolice said this white Hyundai Elantra was spotted near the crime scene early morning of November 13. Moscow Police/Stock Photo\n\nInvestigators said they are interested in speaking with the occupant or occupants of a white 2011-2013 Hyundai Elantra spotted near the crime scene around the time of the killings.\n\n“Investigators believe the occupant(s) of this vehicle may have critical information to share regarding this case,” the police statement said, noting it had an unknown license plate.\n\nMoscow police began returning some of the personal belongings of the four victims to the their families, officials said.\n\n“It’s time for us to give those things back that really mean something to those families and hopefully to help with some of their healing,” Police Chief Fry said in a brief video statement.\n\n“I’m a dad, I understand the meaning behind some of those things,” Fry said. The items being removed are “no longer needed for the investigation,” the police department said.\n\nFriday, December 9\n\nMoscow police said they have received an overwhelming number of tips related to their search for a white sedan seen near the crime scene around the time of the killings.\n\nInvestigators were working through more than 6,000 tips they have received over the course of the investigation, Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell told CNN.\n\nDue to the number of tips received, calls were being directed to an FBI call center to help sort leads received, police said.\n\nMonday, December 12\n\n“We are still 100% committed to solving this crime,” Moscow Police Capt. Lanier said in a video update on the investigation.\n\n“We’re not releasing specific details because we do not want to compromise this investigation. It’s what we must do. We owe that to the families, and we owe that to the victims. We want more than just an arrest, we want a conviction,” Lanier said.\n\nLanier’s remarks came as hundreds of University of Idaho students were taking final exams the week before the fall semester ends.\n\n“Our analysts have spent hours sorting through and trying to come up with the most relevant tips first for the investigators to follow up on. They have reinterviewed some of the folks we’ve interviewed earlier in this investigation to clarify information,” Lanier said.\n\nEveryone in Moscow should be aware of their surroundings, avoid walking in dark places and walk in groups when possible, Lanier said.\n\n“This is not an indication of a specific elevated risk, but something that we should be vigilant with just in our daily lives,” he added.\n\nThursday, December 15\n\nKristi Goncalves, the mother of 21-year-old victim Kaylee Goncalves, expressed frustration over police communications on the status of the investigation into the killings in an interview aired on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\n“It’s sleepless nights. It’s feeling sick to your stomach. It’s just being left in the dark,” Goncalves said in the interview.\n\nGoncalves also recounted the day she learned something had happened to her daughter.\n\n“We’re running around for hours just not knowing what was going on, what happened,” she said. “… We found out by people calling us. And the sheriff showed up about three hours later.”\n\nGoncalves described learning about the police interest in a white Hyundai sedan seen in the area around the time of the murders not from investigators, but from reading about it in a news release sent to her by someone else.\n\n“My first thought just started being like, how long have they had this information? Where do they get this information? Was it on a camera?” Goncalves said.\n\nTuesday, December 27\n\nTrash recovered from the Kohberger family residence by Pennsylvania law enforcement and sent to the Idaho State Lab for DNA testing was used to help investigators narrow down Bryan Kohberger as the suspect in the Idaho murders, according to court documents released on January 5.\n\nThe next day “the Idaho State Lab reported that a DNA profile obtained from the trash” matched a tan leather knife sheath found “laying on the bed” of one of the victims, according to the documents.\n\n“On December 28, 2022, the Idaho State Lab reported that a DNA profile obtained from the trash and the DNA profile obtained from the sheath, identified a male as not being excluded as the biological father of Suspect Profile,” the document says.\n\n“At least 99.9998% of the male population would be expected to be excluded from the possibility of being the suspect’s biological father.”\n\nThursday, December 29\n\nPolice said they have received about 20,000 tips through more than 9,025 emails, 4,575 phone calls, and 6,050 digital media submissions, while having conducted over 300 interviews in the case of the four students slain in an off-campus home.\n\nThe home where the killings took place will be cleaned up but remain an active crime scene under police control, authorities said Thursday.\n\nMoscow police said they have worked with a property management services company to remove “potential biohazards and other harmful substances used to collect evidence,” the update said. The home will be turned over to the property management company.\n\nFriday, December 30\n\nA suspect was taken into custody in connection with the investigation into the murders of the four students, two federal law enforcement sources confirmed to CNN on Friday.\n\nThe arrest in the fatal stabbing case was made by Pennsylvania State Police and the FBI in northeastern Pennsylvania, the law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nLater that afternoon, Moscow Police Chief Fry in a news conference confirmed the arrest in Pennsylvania on a warrant for the murders of the four students. Kohberger resides in Pullman, Washington, and is a graduate student, Fry said.\n\nA criminal complaint was filed on Thursday charging Kohberger with four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary, Latah County Prosecutor Thompson said during the news conference.\n\nKohberger’s DNA has also been matched to genetic material recovered at the off-campus house where the students were stabbed to death, sources told CNN.\n\nThompson told members of the public that investigators are not done building their case against the suspect and that officials still need help gathering more information.\n\nFry said police will aim to prove as much information they can about the extradition to Idaho and the criminal process, but due to Idaho state law they are limited in the information they can share until the suspect has his initial appearance in an Idaho court.\n\nTuesday, January 3\n\nIn an extradition hearing in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, Kohberger agreed to be extradited to Idaho. The judge ordered that he must be handed over to the custody of Latah County District Attorney’s Office in Idaho within 10 days.\n\nThursday, January 5\n\nKohberger made his initial appearance in court at the Latah County Courthouse in Moscow, Idaho on January 5.\n\nKohberger smiled at his public defender when he walked into the courtroom and did not appear to made eye contact with anyone else throughout the entire proceeding, including family members of victims who were crying in the first row.\n\nBryan Kohberger, right, who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, is escorted into a courtroom for a hearing in Latah County District Court, Thursday, January 5, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho.

Officials held a groundbreaking Thursday for Grand River Technology Park, which will be located off Interstate 20 beside Barber Motorsports Park near Leeds. The project is planned as a regional site for research, development and light manufacturing. It’s also being billed for tourism, as the race track is nearby, and the Southern Museum of Flight plans to relocate there. Al.com reports the park is being funded in part by a $6 million grant from an Alabama Labor Department program to use abandoned mine sites. The park will reclaim about 105 acres of undeveloped land surrounding several old coal mining areas in eastern Jefferson County.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has extended its deadline to review numerous comments submitted for a draft environmental review of the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. Assistant Secretary of the Army R.D. James extended Thursday’s deadline to Feb. 28 to consider comments, including those from the Environmental Protection Agency, and to draft a preliminary final environmental impact statement. In a letter to the EPA, James says the Corps, the EPA and others will meet soon to resolve outstanding issues related to the proposed gold and copper mine. The new deadline reflects EPA’s 30-day request to review the draft statements and to consult with the Corps as they develop final versions.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A woman who teaches third graders from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is the first Native American to be named the Arizona Education Foundation’s teacher of the year. Lynette Stant teaches at Salt River Elementary, a Bureau of Indian Education school located in the community near Scottsdale. Stant’s recognition as Arizona’s top teacher was announced Thursday. A member of the Navajo Nation, she’s the first Native American to receive the recognition in the award’s 37-year history. The teacher says she attended a small reservation school in New Mexico during her primary years. Stant has been teaching at the Salt River school for 16 years. It has 19 teachers and about 330 students.\n\nArkansas\n\nYellville: Officials say a hunter died after he was attacked by a deer that he’d shot and believed to be dead. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens says 66-year-old Thomas Alexander shot a buck with a muzzleloader while hunting Tuesday near Yellville, an area in the Ozark Mountains about 105 miles north of Little Rock. Stephens tells Springfield, Missouri, television station KY3 the buck attacked Alexander when the hunter approached the animal to see if it was dead. He says Alexander, who suffered multiple puncture wounds, later died at a hospital. Stephens says it’s not clear how long Alexander waited before checking on the deer, but that the agency recommends waiting at least 30 minutes before approaching.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWestminster: The remains of 81 South Vietnamese soldiers shot down over Vietnam in 1965 have been interred at Southern California’s Westminster Memorial Park. Richard Spencer, secretary of the U.S. Navy, joined local officials for a procession and ceremony Saturday just outside Little Saigon in Orange County. The airborne soldiers of the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam were shot down in a remote area along with four American service members. The remains, which were commingled, were recovered in 1974 and eventually shipped to the U.S. The Americans were identified thanks to DNA technology. Efforts to return the other remains to Vietnam failed, so officials decided to give the unknown South Vietnamese soldiers a final resting place in the U.S. Orange County is home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A doctor fired by a Christian hospital company after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to hasten his death has a new job with a community health center. The Denver Post reports Dr. Barbara Morris, a geriatrician, has accepted a job with Stride Community Health Center in Lakewood. Stride officials say she will start in February. Morris was fired from St. Anthony Hospital in August after she and a patient filed a legal case challenging Centura Health’s policy against physician aid-in-dying. Centura was formed by Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist health care ministries. Colorado voters legalized physician aid-in-dying in 2016. The law forbids limiting a physican’s medical judgment on the issue, but the hospitals argue Colorado law can’t interfere with a religious organization carrying out its mission.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is considering turning five residential streets into what it’s calling “bicycle boulevards.” The Hartford Courant reports the city will hold public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss repurposing the roads for use mostly by bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Vehicle traffic would not be blocked on the streets but would be discouraged through signage. Similar streets have been set up in more than 10 states across the country and are sometimes referred to as “neighborways” or “neighborhood greenways.” The “bike boulevards” would be paid for with a $100,000, private Made to Move grant, an initiative between Degree Deodorant and Blue Zones LLC, founded by author Dan Buettner.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The City Council violated state law when it barred a man from speaking at one of its public meetings last month, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Friday in an opinion. Dion Wilson was banned from speaking at the Sept. 19 meeting after being accused by City Council President Hanifa Shabazz of disrupting two meetings by yelling after she prevented him from speaking during the public comment portion, noting the use of profanity. Shabazz said she will ensure that City Council meetings comply with all regulations. The Justice Department’s decision did not touch on Wilson’s Oct. 2 arrest, in which he was charged with harassment and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Donald Trump’s company is exploring the sale of its Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, which has been at the center of three years of ethics complaints and lawsuits accusing him of trying to profit off the presidency. The Trump Organization said in a statement Friday that it will consider offers to buy it out of a 60-year lease of the building partly because “people are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel.” The Trump International Hotel has been a magnet for lobbyists and diplomats looking to curry favor with the Trump administration. In Trump’s latest financial disclosure, the opulent hotel built from the Old Post Office building just steps from the White House generated nearly $41 million, up less than half a million from last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The often-decadent Fantasy Fest wrapped up over the weekend, bringing flair to this island town. At Wednesday evening’s family friendly Pet Masquerade, entrants included costumed dogs, cats and a tortoise carrying a plush rabbit themed “The Tortoise and the Hare,” drawing inspiration from the fable of the same name. The overall winner was Diana Benton of Titusville, Florida, who dressed her two cats as country artists Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, subscribing to the festival’s musical theme of “In Tune But ... Off Key.” Other highlights included Friday afternoon’s masquerade march and a parade with floats and flamboyantly costumed marching groups. Saturday night’s parade was expected to draw some 60,000 revelers. The 10-day festival ended Sunday after a children’s carnival and an afternoon dance party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Overall grades for the state’s schools fell in the 2018-2019 school year, with two state leaders repeating their call to overhaul grading methods. The typical school statewide scored 75.9 points on a 100-point scale, down from 76.6 points last year. Performance rose in high schools but fell slightly in elementary schools and more broadly in middle schools. Georgia’s system seeks to grade schools on student content mastery, academic progress and readiness, whether underperforming groups are closing gaps, and whether high school students graduate on time. State officials say scores fell because of lower scores on progress and closing gaps. State Superintendent Richard Woods and Gov. Brian Kemp say they want changes, with Woods calling for less reliance on standardized test scores.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge says a 93-year-old Native Hawaiian heiress doesn’t need a guardian to take care of her but is ordering a hearing to determine whether she needs a conservator to manage her $215 million trust. Abigail Kawananakoa’s wealth has been tied up in a legal battle since her 2017 stroke. She’s considered a princess because she’s a descendant of the family that ruled Hawaii before the kingdom’s 1893 overthrow. Board members of her foundation and ex-employees say her wife is manipulating her. Lawyers for the couple dispute that. Native Hawaiians have been watching the case because they’re concerned about the fate of the foundation she set up to benefit Hawaiians. The couple’s lawyers said Friday that Kawananakoa should be able to do what she wants with her money.\n\nIdaho\n\nChallis: Officials say they plan to use a helicopter to capture 365 wild horses in central Idaho in early November to reduce the number of horses to about 185. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in a news release Friday says the roundup in the Challis Herd Management Area near the town of Challis will begin on or about Nov. 5 and take up to nine days. The agency says balancing herd size with what the 260-square-mile management area can support will help protect habitat for wildlife species such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, mule deer and elk. The agency says mares released back into the management area will be treated with fertility control. About 240 horses not released back into the wild will be transported to the Bruneau Wild Horse Off-Range Corral facility southeast of Boise for adoption.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum has returned 42 culturally significant items to representatives of two Aboriginal communities in Australia. A University of Chicago anthropologist who worked in Australia to record indigenous languages collected the items between 1929 and 1931. They were transferred to the museum in 1942. The State Journal-Register reports that an Australian delegation received the artifacts Wednesday during a ceremony at the Illinois State Museum’s Research and Collections Center in Springfield. Brooke Morgan, the museum’s curator of anthropology, said the items returned include secret, sacred, secular and ceremonial objects. They will be returned to Aranda and Bardi Jawi communities in Australia. Morgan said the items will be used in Australia to “revitalize cultural practices” to teach young generations how to make these traditional artifacts.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A northern Indiana airport’s parking ramp for aircraft will undergo a half-million-dollar repaving job after two jets sank into the asphalt over the summer. City attorney Lawrence Meteiver says the ramp was installed at the Elkhart Municipal Airport last year by the city at a cost of about $50,000. Indiana Flight Center President Brett Zierle says a 30,000-pound Bombardier Challenger and a 15,500-pound Cessna Citation XLS sank into the asphalt ramp in June on days when the temperature reached only into the 70s. He says the asphalt is soft and not capable of supporting the weight of those aircraft. The Elkhart Truth reports that Meteiver says an asphalt mix recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration will be installed after this winter at a cost of about $565,000.\n\nIowa\n\nKnoxville: A woman has died after an explosion at a gender reveal party created debris that hit her. The Marion County Sheriff’s office says the explosion happened at a home in central Iowa about 4 p.m. Saturday during a party to announce the gender of a baby a couple is expecting. Deputies arrived at the home in Knoxville, about 40 miles southeast of Des Moines, to find a 56-year-old woman dead. Investigators determined an explosion during the gender reveal announcement caused the woman’s death. No other details about the explosion were available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators went too far by criminalizing violent language not backed up by an intent to act, the state’s highest court ruled Friday in striking down part of a law that it says violates free speech rights. The Kansas Supreme Court kept in place portions of the 2010 law banning “true threats” but struck down the provision making it a felony for someone to be “reckless” in using threatening language that makes others afraid, even if the person making the comments doesn’t intend violence. The justices said that part of the law is so broad that it might apply to the speech of political protesters, violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the state still can prosecute people who intentionally threaten of violence.\n\nKentucky\n\nBurgin: The Federal Aviation Administration says a mysterious object that seemingly dropped from the sky and damaged a man’s mobile home didn’t come from an airplane. Tommy Woosley says a heavy, nearly footlong canister-type object hit his home in Burgin, about 75 miles southeast of Louisville, two weeks ago. But the FAA and Norfolk Southern Railway say their transportation units have nothing to do with the object that lodged into the siding of his home. The National Guard and nearby Fort Campbell military base have also denied responsibility. Authorities initially believed the canister may have fallen from a plane, but an FAA spokeswoman says their investigation ruled it out. She says the agency is turning the object over to the Mercer County Sheriff’s Office for further investigation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Former Mayor Mitch Landrieu is tackling the race issue, starting with a report called “Divided by Design.” The report released Friday is based on surveys and interviews with people in in 28 communities in 13 Southern states. It touts efforts to bridge racial gaps. But it also says segregation and inequality remain major barriers to advancement for many. And it notes widespread, conflicting views on racism among African Americans, Latinos and whites. When Landrieu was mayor, he removed four Jim Crow-era monuments from the New Orleans landscape, including statues of three Confederate icons. This report is the first project of the E Pluribus Unum Fund, which Landrieu launched after leaving office in May 2018. It calls for cultivating courageous leaders who can build common ground.\n\nMaine\n\nWest Gardiner: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills says a new, fast-charging station for electric cars and incentives for more of them will help break fossil fuel companies’ “stranglehold” over Mainers’ wallets. Mills on Friday unveiled the new charging station at the Maine Turnpike plaza in West Gardiner, saying it was funded through federal Volkswagen settlement money awarded to the state’s Department of Transportation. Mills also says 23 municipalities will receive incentives to install 47 new charging stations across the state for public use. It’s part of a larger effort to boost the charging infrastructure for electric cars. Mills says charging stations make electric cars a reality for more people, help people save money on fuel and protect the environment. She calls it a “hat-trick for Maine.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBerlin: A 14-year-old girl has adopted all 75 ponies from the Maryland herd of Assateague Island ponies. Zoe Newman this month became the first person ever to foster every horse in the herd. The adoptions, which have cost Zoe and her mother more than $3,000 so far, are symbolic and provide the Assateague Island National Seashore with education and herd management funds. Zoe and her mother, Sam Newman, often get up at 4 a.m. to make the three-hour drive from their Lexington Park home to get to the park by sunrise. They’ve visited about 30 times over the past few years. Zoe first adopted an Assateague pony when she was 10 years old and used her savings on a chestnut pinto named Annie Laurie.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A new study is recommending state officials address gambling addiction in Asian American communities. Researchers with the University of Massachusetts-Boston presented to the state’s Gaming Commission last week the results of a state-funded study in Boston’s Chinatown. The study found Chinatown residents who frequently visited casinos in the region did so to relieve stress from their low-wage jobs or in the hopes of escaping poverty. Researchers also found study participants were drawn to casinos because of gambling coupons, meal deals, bus rides and other casino promotions targeting Asian communities. The researchers recommend the state develop “culturally tailored” public health campaigns and gambling counseling services. They also recommend launching a broader study encompassing Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese communities in Quincy, Lowell, Malden and Worcester.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A study has found few of the state’s residents are taking advantage of a legal option that allows people to erase their criminal convictions, even though an expungement can open doors to housing, student loans and employment. A University of Michigan law school study estimates just 6.5% of people who meet the requirements end up having their convictions set aside within five years of becoming eligible. Attorneys and law students volunteered their time last week at a free clinic in Lansing to educate more than 100 people on how to clear their records. The University of Detroit Mercy School of Law is using a $20,000 grant from the Michigan State Bar Foundation to host a series of free clinics around the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A homeless man who pleaded guilty to starting a fire that destroyed a 117-year-old synagogue has been sentenced to three months in jail and 192 hours of community service. KTTC-TV reports 36-year-old Matthew Amiot was sentenced Friday. He pleaded guilty last month to negligent fire charges. Amiot received credit for the 36 days he has already served in jail. The fire destroyed the Adas Israel Synagogue in Duluth on Sept. 9. Authorities say Amiot used a lighter to ignite combustible materials outside the main building, near a separate religious structure called a sukkah. Amiot told police he tried to spit on the fire to put it out and walked away when that didn’t work. Police don’t believe the fire was a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nTaylor: The site of an elementary school that served black children during segregation is set to become a park. The Oxford Eagle reports the plans for the park at the site of Weems Elementary were approved last week by the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors. The supervisors approved demolition of the school in May 2018 after a fire damaged most of the structure. A $1-per-year lease was approved with the newly formed nonprofit group Taylor Park Recreation, which will raise money for park construction. Throughout the 1960s, Weems taught black students between first and eighth grades. The state’s public schools were officially integrated in 1970, leading many such schools to shutter.\n\nMissouri\n\nSparta: The mayor of this tiny town says its hand-activated tornado warning siren needs to be retired. Mayor Jenni Davis is the only person in the town of 1,900 residents authorized to activate the tornado siren. The problem with the odd and antiquated system became evident early Monday when a twister was approaching town. Davis wanted to get downtown to flip the switch activating the siren, but a tree blocked her path. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Some towns are turning away from tornado warning sirens because cellphone apps and other technology that alert to approaching storms are increasingly common. But some experts say outdoor sirens still serve a purpose. Davis would like to replace the old siren, but the cost of up to $50,000 is more than the city can afford. A congressman’s office is seeking grant money to help.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Crews have completed the two-year, nearly $9 million effort of reconstructing the historic Sperry Chalet in Glacier National Park after it was gutted by a wildfire. Project Manager Travis Neil of Dick Anderson Construction tells the Hungry Horse News that the crews will return next year to finish some minor tasks to help the National Park Service to get the chalet opened for next summer. The 105-year-old wood and stone dormitory located in a remote area of the park burned when embers from a wildfire rained down on it Aug. 31, 2017. All that remained was the building’s stone shell. Kevin Warrington of Belton Chalets, which operates the chalet, said Sperry Chalet will take reservations on Jan. 13, 2020, for the summer season.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A career military man and former superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy was chosen Friday as the top candidate to become the next president of the University of Nebraska system. The university Board of Regents voted unanimously to nominate Walter “Ted” Carter Jr. as their priority candidate. Carter is a retired Navy vice admiral and served as superintendent of his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, from 2014 until this year. “Ted’s character and integrity are second to none,” said University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, of Columbus, who led the search. “He has a proven focus on the success and well-being of students, faculty and staff. He has a deep appreciation for the role and mission of higher education. And is a public servant in every sense of the word.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Police say a woman who was angered when she was kicked out of an area casino intentionally drove her motorhome into the building, injuring a custodian. North Las Vegas Police spokesman Eric Leavitt says the 50-year-old woman was ejected from the Cannery casino Friday morning and drove her Winnebago into the building. Leavitt says the woman hit a 66-year-old custodial worker outside the building. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the worker was critically injured but is expected to survive. Leavitt told KVVU-TV the woman kept hitting the gas, and her vehicle was stuck in the building’s entrance. Employees had to remove the woman to get her to stop. Leavitt says police who were already at the casino arrested the woman. Her identity was not immediately released.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampstead: Parents and other visitors to schools in the town are no longer allowed to bring guns onto school property. The Eagle Tribune reports the School Board unanimously approved a policy prohibiting anyone other than law enforcement and school resource officers from bringing guns on campus during school hours and during school-sponsored activities. The district already had rules against students and staff carrying firearms. School board member Karen Yasenka said the policy protects students and staff without infringing on anyone’s rights. The Legislature passed a bill this year that would have banned most guns from school grounds statewide, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed it.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Long Branch: The personal stories of people who survived Superstorm Sandy are an integral part of a new art exhibit remembering the deadly storm and the devastation it caused seven years ago. The Monmouth University exhibit also includes an obelisk made from slices from trees that fell during the storm, with each inch representing 2,703 lost housing units. There are hanging posters resembling beach towels that present Sandy-related data in easy-to-grasp visual terms. A “climate shelter,” for which all the trappings of a home that would normally be on the inside are on the outside, symbolizes the huge mounds of sodden possessions that became garbage.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlong the Burnt Mesa Trail: Conservationists and forestry experts are scouring the American Southwest, hoping to gather as many ponderosa pine cones as possible to give nature a hand in restoring fire-scarred landscapes. The goal: 1 million seeds. It might sound lofty, but those helping with the project are looking to take advantage of a rare bumper crop this fall that has resulted from back-to-back summer and winter seasons of much-needed rain and snow. It takes time to find the patches of trees that will yield the most seeds. One spot is a mesa in northern New Mexico that overlooks vast expanses of rugged terrain that has seen its share of fire over the last two decades. With drought and the severity of wildfires on the rise, scientists say seed collection and reforestation are becoming more important across the West.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are flocking to greet a new arrival to the city – Wegmans grocery store. The popular regional chain officially opened its first New York City outpost Sunday, a 74,000-square-foot store at the Brooklyn Navy Yard with more than 500 employees. Despite the rain, crowds turned out Sunday to take a look at a selection the company says includes almost 50,000 items. Aside from groceries, the store offers a range of food options, including sushi, pizza and buffet bars, and has a bar serving alcohol in the cafe. The new Brooklyn outpost is the 101st store for Wegmans, which was founded over a century ago in Rochester, New York, and is still family-owned.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRodanthe: Researchers say they’re seeing a growing number of great white sharks off the coast of the state’s Outer Banks. The Raleigh News & Observer reports that four sharks with tracking devices have “pinged” in recent days. The sharks are being tracked by researchers with the organization Ocearch, which said on Twitter that a shark named Ironbound was among the sharks that were traveling near the Outer Banks community of Corolla and moving down the coast toward Rodanthe. Ironbound is a 12-foot, 4-inch male great white who weighs about 1,000 pounds. The organization is tracking three other male great white sharks between 10 and 12 feet in length. Great white sharks are known to swim off the southeastern United States coast in the winter.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Democrats in the state Senate have joined the call for a senator to resign his leadership position in the wake of his Facebook posts targeting a Muslim U.S. congresswoman from Minnesota. The Bismarck Tribune reports Democratic senators wrote a letter Thursday to Sen. Oley Larsen, a Minot Republican, asking that he relinquish his position as president pro tempore. Their letter came a day after Larsen sent an email to his fellow senators, asking to “gauge each of your stance” on his leadership role. Last week Larsen posted a long-debunked photo that purports to show Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., holding a weapon at an al-Qaida training camp. The image actually shows a female Somali army recruit at a Mogadishu military training campus in 1978, four years before Omar was born in 1982.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Thousands of acres in eastern Ohio that the state says it’s buying to promote recreation and conservation may be drilled for oil and natural gas. The Columbus Dispatch reports a draft purchase agreement obtained by the newspaper shows American Electric Power will retain subsurface rights to more than 31,000 acres it’s selling to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for $47 million. The document states AEP will have the continuing right to drill. AEP spokesman Scott Blake says no active fracking is underway on the land. He says the power company will work with the state to coordinate that activity if the situation changes. Natural Resources Department spokeswoman Sarah Wickham says the state is “reasonably certain” the property includes active wells.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A second police officer has testified that an unarmed man wasn’t a threat when a fellow officer fatally shot him after the victim called 911 threatening suicide. Keith Sweeney is charged with murder in the 2017 killing of 29-year-old Dustin Pigeon, who was apparently trying to set himself on fire with lighter fluid when police arrived. The Oklahoman reports that Officer Troy Nitzky testified Friday that he didn’t see Pigeon as a threat. Sgt. Erik Howell testified Thursday that Pigeon didn’t have a gun or a knife and that he didn’t “observe any threatening acts.” Defense attorney Gary James has said that Sweeney didn’t know Pigeon was unarmed because the other officers didn’t notify him by radio and that Sweeney made the proper decision “based on the information he was given.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s LGBTQ community has updated rights to equal treatment under an executive order signed by Gov. Kate Brown. America’s first openly bisexual governor said a 1987 executive order needed to be updated to reflect current law and understandings about sexual orientation and gender identity. The executive order, signed Friday, prohibits state agencies from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It directs state agencies to treat everyone consistent with their gender identity and to modify forms to add a third option – “nonbinary/other” – in addition to “male” and “female.” A state agency must also adopt statewide policies to expand access to appropriate restrooms and to accommodate state employees and the public who are transgender, nonbinary or gender nonconforming.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An internal review of the state’s parole system spurred by five parolees getting charged in quick succession with homicide is, in theory, acknowledging a long-standing complaint of parole agents. It asks lawmakers to update a 2012 law and add a trigger for an automatic six-month to one-year jail sentence for a parolee who continually ignores parole conditions, such as going to treatment or counseling. The 2012 law already has five such triggers, including threatening behavior or possession of a weapon. Law enforcement groups largely welcomed the acknowledgement from the state Department of Corrections. The county district attorneys association calls it a “significant recognition.” Parole agents, however, were skeptical it’ll change a system they say has stripped them of discretion to pull a potentially dangerous parolee off the street.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: A memorial was dedicated over the weekend for 97 firefighters who have died in the line of duty in the state since the 1800s. North Kingstown Fire Chief Scott Kettelle says firefighters raised more than $300,000 for the memorial dedicated Saturday at the state Fire Training Academy. Construction has taken about a year. The Providence Journal reports firefighters who have died since recordkeeping began in the 1800s are being commemorated for their sacrifice. Kettelle says he and other organizers hope the event can become an annual tradition. The fire department plans to continue adding more names with fundraising through the sale of engraved paving bricks. The memorial is open to the public.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is again requiring all sex offenders to stay inside with their outside lights off and not give out trick-or-treat candy on Halloween. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services spokesman Pete O’Boyle said the requirement to stay inside runs from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. statewide Oct. 31. O’Boyle says some counties will require all sex offenders to go to a central location to be supervised for several hours on Halloween. O’Boyle said in a statement that agents will be checking on offenders in all 46 South Carolina counties. Last year, agents checked more than 350 homes and made more than 150 phone calls.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Transportation Commission has passed rules for truck platooning. The practice links two or more trucks in a convoy, using connected technology and automated driving support systems. Drivers are still behind the wheel of the trucks, but when synced, the vehicles behind the leader adapt to changes in movement with little or no action from the drivers. KELO-TV reports truck companies need special permits from the Department of Public Safety to platoon. The commission is allowing the practice only on South Dakota’s interstates, except in certain weather conditions and during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee will consider the rules Nov. 4. Twenty-nine states now allow truck platooning, including all of South Dakota’s neighbors.\n\nTennessee\n\nErwin: The town is preparing to auction off a herd of brightly painted elephant statues that recall a dark day in local history. The Johnson City Press reports the auction is part of a community initiative called the Erwin Elephant Revival. It honors a circus elephant named Mary who was hanged from a derrick in Erwin’s railyard in 1916 after she killed her trainer. The Elephant Revival lets residents reflect on the past while raising money for the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald. The statues are getting added attention this year after local high school students won a National Public Radio competition for their podcast on the initiative. The silent auction takes place Monday through Friday at Erwin Town Hall. More information is available online.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: A charity that trains service dogs for disabled veterans has commissioned a statue of the late George H.W. Bush’s service dog for the 41st president’s library. America’s VetDogs has commissioned sculptor Susan Bahary to create the bronze statue of Sully for placement in the east wing of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University. VetDogs President John Miller says the statue will depict Sully sitting with his leash in his mouth, the “retrieve” task VetDogs trains its dogs to perform. It will show Sully wearing his America’s VetDogs vest with the Great Seal of the United States on its back. The yellow Labrador golden retriever assisted the former president for the last six months of his life before Bush’s death last November at age 94.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A rule that would have allowed ATVs on certain roads in the five national parks in the state has been rescinded by the National Park Service. The agency said in a news release Friday that it changed its mind after further consultation with Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt, whose agency includes the National Park Service. The agency didn’t provide reasons for the reversal. The rule would have gone into effect Nov. 1 to conform to a state law that allows any “street-legal” vehicle on state and county roads. Instead, a long-standing ban on ATVs in parks will remain. Ashley Korenblat, an advocate for preserving public lands and CEO of Western Spirit Cycling in Moab, Utah, applauded a move she said will ensure ATVs aren’t crammed into already congested national parks.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: The town lost almost $250,000 in an email scam. A report released by Norwich details how town Finance Director Donna Flies ignored instructions to stop unauthorized payments from municipal accounts. Town Treasurer Cheryl Lindberg says she confronted Flies, telling her that payments from Norwich accounts require select board approval. Authorities say Flies assumed emails requesting large sums of money were from her boss, Town Manager Herb Durfee. Flies told investigators the only thing she did wrong was to make “stupid mistakes.” Valley News reports the report blames both Flies for failing to detect the scam and town officials for failing to confront her. No one’s been charged with a crime. Officials say $79,765 was returned by Comerica Bank.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: A poet and civil rights activist from the city will be honored in the U.S. Postal Service’s 2020 Forever stamp series. Anne Spencer, who died in 1975, is included in the recently unveiled “Voices of the Harlem Renaissance” series. In a news release, the USPS says the set of 20 stamps pays homage to “one of the great artistic and literary movements in American history.” The News & Advance reports that Spencer enrolled at what’s now the Virginia University of Lynchburg at 11 years old when she was barely literate and graduated six years later as valedictorian. She went on to become a poet, librarian, and contemporary of African-American artists and political leaders. Spencer also helped found the Lynchburg chapter of the NAACP in 1918.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Sound Transit board members have abandoned ideas for a $450 million tunnel into the city’s historic central Ballard, a $200 million bored tunnel through West Seattle’s Pigeon Point neighborhood, and a fully elevated trackway in Sodo that would have blocked light-rail travel during construction. The Seattle Times reports cheaper options that serve the same number of passengers and will still cost hundreds of millions of dollars will now gain momentum during environmental studies. Politicians on the 18-member board have entertained dozens of alignment concepts since 2016, when voters passed the $54 billion ST3 tax measure to expand regional rail and bus services. The agency promised West Seattle stations in 2030 and stations from south downtown to Seattle Center and Ballard by 2035.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Inmates in state prisons now have access to specially designed tablet computers. The Register-Herald reports the tablets are provided at no cost to taxpayers by Global Tel Link through its inmate banking services contract with the prison system. The tablets give the prisoners access to email, video visitation, electronic books, music, games and movies. They lack a normal internet browser but do allow access to select websites, including educational and career sites. All apps and websites are approved by the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The devices will soon help inmates submit requests, file grievances and order from the facility commissary. West Virginia’s tablet program began as a pilot at the Saint Mary’s Correctional Center last year. Then-Superintendent Patrick Mirandy said he saw the tablets improve facility safety.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross is retiring. The 71-year-old Cross said Friday that he plans to retire once a new president is selected. Cross has served as UW’s president since February 2014. He previously served three years as chancellor of UW Colleges and UW-Extension and has spent more than four decades in higher education, previously working in Minnesota and Michigan. He served three years in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Cross says serving as UW president has been the most rewarding work of his life. UW Board of Regents President Andrew Petersen says in a statement that Cross has been tireless in leading the system with vision and integrity. He says Cross stabilized the system at a time of legislative skepticism and financial challenges.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation reports 28 moose were killed on roads in Teton County from May 2018 through April 2019. It’s the highest moose toll since 33 were killed from May 2010 through April 2011. Eight were killed along Moose-Wilson Road. The foundation’s executive director, Jon Mobeck, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide on Friday that the overall wildlife toll of 267 animals reported hit was the fifth-highest since the foundation started keeping tabs in 1990. Elk collisions totaled 34 in the most recent report, down from the 40s in the previous two years. The foundation’s report does not include animals found dead and reported hit in Grand Teton National Park, where elk and moose collisions increased from 2017 to 2018.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/economy/railroad-strike-economic-impact/index.html", "title": "How the freight rail workers strike could affect you and the US ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US economy can keep running without freight trains — but not for long.\n\nThat is why the risk of the first national railroad strike in 30 years is so worrying to economists and businesses. A brief work stoppage — some previous rail strikes have lasted only hours — likely won’t cause much economic disruption.\n\nBut a prolonged walkout of a week or more will cripple the nation’s still struggling supply chain, cause widespread shutdowns and shortages, and likely further drive up prices even as inflation remains near a 40-year high.\n\n“At a week, you see real damage in the US economy,” said economist Patrick Anderson of Anderson Economic Group, which conducts impact estimates on work stoppages.\n\nIf it lasts a week, a strike will mean reduced gas production, spoiled crops, a choked off supply of new cars and empty shelves at stores over the holidays. Your commute may be snarled. And for factory workers, there could be temporary layoffs in the near future.\n\nAmerica’s railroads remain crucial for keeping the US economy running smoothly. They carry nearly 30% of the nation’s freight, measured by the distance traveled and the weight of the cargo, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And there really isn’t an alternative if the trains stop running.\n\n“Idling all 7,000 long distance daily freight trains in the US would require more than 460,000 additional long-haul trucks every day, which is not possible based on equipment availability and an existing shortage of 80,000 drivers,” said Chris Spear, CEO of the American Trucking Associations in a letter to members of Congress asking that they act to prevent a strike. “As such, any rail service disruption will create havoc in the supply chain and fuel inflationary pressures across the board.”\n\nAnderson said it is impossible to come up with a dollar estimate for the impact on the economy at this point, but he said the costs will grow geometrically the longer the strike lasts, starting out at tens of millions of dollars and growing rapidly each day.\n\n“It might only be millions, but that’s a lot if it’s your job that’s one that is being lost,” he said. “If we reach a week-long strike, we’re in uncharted territory,” he said.\n\nGasoline\n\nThe price of gas has been falling steadily for three months. But a rail strike could send prices shooting higher again due to limited supplies.\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship out most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines as well. But railroad tank cars are a key part of the process to make the gas that ends up in your tank.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail. Without ethanol, gasoline wouldn’t be compliant with some environmental regulations. But even if those regulations could be waived, the lack of ethanol could increase the cost of a gallon of gas by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nAlthough pipelines carry most crude oil to refineries, about 300,000 barrels move by rail each day, a volume that could supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries’ trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also arrive via rail, and some lower-grade products and waste materials need to be shipped out by rail.\n\n“If rail cars aren’t coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,” the refineries’ trade group said.\n\nFood\n\nThe strike would be hitting at a particularly bad time for the nation’s agricultural industry. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data show that trains account for 27% of the distance grains travel when measured by weight.\n\n“A rail stoppage on September 16 would hit right as the fall harvest accelerates in many parts of the United States,” said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. “The economic damages across the food and agricultural supply chain would be swift and severe.”\n\nThe railroads started refusing to take new shipments of grain as of Wednesday in preparation for the possible strike. If the work stoppage happens, grain operators will load what they can onto rail containers sitting in their yards. But they won’t be able to move them out or accept additional grain from farmers, who will then have limited options to sell their crops.\n\nIn recent months there have been improvements to farmers’ supply chain issues suffered during the pandemic.\n\n“The gains we’ve made in the last seven to eight months will be reversed largely if this strike happens,” said Terri Moore, spokesperson for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nIn addition, farmers preparing to plant for the fall season could see shortages of the fertilizer they need, since the railroads have already stopped accepting shipments because they are classified as hazardous materials in many cases. That could hurt future supplies of crops.\n\n“There definitely would be at least some price increase for consumers,” said Max Fisher, chief economist at the National Grain and Feed Association. “If our processing plants are not running, the food manufacturers that buy these ingredients won’t have access to them for an extended period of time. Depending on how long it would go on, we worry about scarcity — being able to actually get the food.”\n\nBeyond domestic food prices, the strike could affect global food markets, since the US is a major grain exporter. With the war in Ukraine cutting off much the grain from that country, a disruption in US supply will only make a bad situation worse.\n\nCars and trucks\n\nCar and truck production has already been hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips. That has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots, which in turn has resulted in record high car prices.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. There are nowhere near enough trucks to carry that many vehicles.\n\nIn addition, many of those parts move between suppliers and car assembly plants by rail. Production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed.\n\nEventually production would resume, but it would take some time to make up for lost output. Which means more upward pressure on car prices.\n\nConsumer goods\n\nThe snarl of container ships coming into West Coast ports is finally easing after years of backlogs and delays. And although things have gotten better, they are by no means “normal” yet.\n\nAs of Tuesday the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest, said it had 27,000 shipping containers waiting to be loaded onto trains. That’s roughly three times as many as under normal conditions. Two thirds of the current inventory of containers have been there nine or more days, when none should have been there that long.\n\n“Efficient rail operations are critical to the Port of Los Angeles,” said Gene Seroka, the port’s executive director. “With two-thirds of our cargo leaving California by rail, the supply chain and the US economy need all of us working at maximum effort.”\n\nThe peak season for imported goods heading to retailers ahead of the holiday shopping period is now. The National Retail Federation said last week it is concerned about shortages later this year if there is a rail strike.\n\n“We are in the middle of the peak import season,” said the trade group. “Any rail network disruptions this month could have long-lasting negative effects on this important selling season. Product delays and shortages are correlated with inflation.”\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered just before they are used in assembly lines — a process known as “just-in-time” deliveries. And many factories depend on rail to get those parts and supplies, as well as to ship them out.\n\n“For years now, America’s manufacturing workers have endured the effects of rapidly rising material costs and severe supply chain disruptions,” said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers. A rail strike would “devastate the movement of manufactured products that families depend on.”\n\nThe rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, as happened across the global auto industry due to the shortage of parts and computer chips brought on by the pandemic.\n\nCommuting\n\nAlthough only the nation’s freight rail lines face a pending strike, many of the nation’s commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads. As a result, many passenger railroads expect to shut down operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak already has cut service on many of its long distance trains. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also are preparing to shut much of their operations for the same reason.\n\nThat could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don’t normally take a train.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym.

Here we look at the five days of violence that tore apart the city beginning 50 years ago today, on July 23, 1967. Last Sunday, we explored the tensions leading to the riot. Next Sunday, we'll examine the aftermath of the riot and its long-term effects on Detroit. You can read our complete coverage online at freep.com/detroit67.\n\nThe red emergency phone rang in Detroit Police Commissioner Ray Girardin’s Lafayette Park bedroom at 5:20 a.m. on that Sunday 50 years ago today.\n\nHe awoke to a shock. It was Police Superintendent Eugene Reuter.\n\n“I think we’ve got trouble on 12th Street,” Reuter said. He told Girardin that a police raid on a an after-hours drinking spot had turned violent. He was calling officers back to duty.\n\nGirardin telephoned his boss, Mayor Jerome Cavanagh, considered the most progressive mayor in big-city America, an Irish-Catholic New Deal Democrat who had made improving race relations a key part of his agenda.\n\nTheir nightmare scenario was unfolding on 12th Street: People were breaking windows, and the crowd was growing. Things seemed to be surging out of control, deteriorating by the minute. Cavanagh and his top aides gathered with Girardin and police officials at 1300 Beaubien, Detroit Police headquarters.\n\nComplete coverage:1967 riot: Rebellion and unrest\n\nAlso read:\n\nDetroit '67: 'The shotguns were loaded,' rookie cop recalls\n\nTheir first task was to get more officers on the streets, on a day that is normally low-crime and the lightest deployment of the week. Girardin was also worried that the 12th Street ruckus might be a diversion for a planned attack on the east side — the big Detroit Edison power plant and city water works on the river, the Belle Isle police dispatch center and many Chrysler facilities.\n\n“Our strategy was to use the forces we had to contain the situation in a small area until outside assistance arrived,” Girardin said afterward, referring to the Michigan State Police and the National Guard.\n\nAmong the looters was then-18-year-old LeeRoy Johnson, who recently recalled the atmosphere: “We saw people running in and out of stores. They were wild on 12th Street.\n\n“People were coming out of businesses, the pawn shops, everything, with all kind of items, they had just go in there and take it, the police standing there don’t even try to stop ’em,” Johnson said in an interview with the Detroit Historical Museum Oral History Project. “So we started looting. We continued to loot up and down 12th all the way to Davison.”\n\nThe blind pig\n\nThe disturbance began with a police raid on a blind pig — an illegal bar — at 9125 12th St., at the corner of Clairmount, on Detroit’s near west side. It was an entirely routine procedure carried out by a vice-squad cleanup crew, whose duty was to bust illegal drinking, gambling or prostitution operations. Police had conducted several other raids that week with no incidents, and they'd busted 9125 12th St. before without a problem.\n\nAt the club, a plainclothes officer bought a beer, and uniformed cops broke in through a locked door. To their surprise, they saw 85 customers and staff, about six times more than they expected. Loading them into paddy wagons and and transporting them to the 10th (Livernois) Precinct took more than an hour. But even at 4:30 on a Sunday morning, people gathered on busy, rowdy 12th Street, which in the blocks south of Clairmount was a well-known sin strip where gambling, prostitution and illegal clubs flourished.\n\nBystanders joked at first with the bar patrons in custody, but the banter turned angry, and the crowd got rowdy. Crowd members targeted the mostly white cops, who were despised in the black community after decades of abuse.\n\nOne agitator on 12th Street, later identified as Michael Lewis, an autoworker, stood out with his green outfit and puffy sleeves, not an unusual ensemble in Detroit in 1967. Cops called him Greensleeves.\n\n“Why do they come down there and do this in our neighborhood?” Lewis shouted to the crowd.\n\nAnother rabble-rouser, by his own account, was Bill Scott III, the son of William Scott II, principal owner of the blind pig. The elder Scott and his daughter, Wilma Scott, a waitress, were arrested the night of the raid. In 1970, Bill Scott — then a University of Michigan student — self-published a memoir of his activities in July 1967. He hated the Detroit police and stood outside the blind pig that night, watching and taunting.\n\n“Are we going to let these peckerwood (expletive) — come down here any time they want and mess us around?” he shouted.\n\n“Hell, no!” people yelled back.\n\nScott claims he threw the first bottle. It shattered on the sidewalk. A line of police moved toward the crowd, then backed away. As the cars drove off, bottles, bricks and sticks flew through the air, smashing the windows of departing police cars.\n\n“For the first time in our lives, we felt free,” Scott wrote. “Most important, we were right in what we did to the law.”\n\nThe rebellion was under way.\n\nWindows started breaking on 12th Street. Scott said he threw a litter basket through the window of Hardy’s Drug Store, a black-owned establishment.\n\n\"Why would Negroes want to tear up their own business places?” the owner later asked a Michigan Chronicle reporter, a question that would be repeated often in the coming days and is even heard today.\n\nAs dawn approached on a hot and sticky night, burglar alarms began clanging, adding to the bedlam of sirens, shouting and shattering glass. People were running in every direction.\n\nA festival atmosphere\n\nGirardin ordered cops to seal off Belle Isle, where the 1943 race riot had begun. That two-day riot, which included hand-to-hand combat between blacks and whites, left 34 people dead.\n\nBut Girardin and Cavanagh took a controversial approach in those early hours in 1967.\n\nEven as more police personnel reported for duty — 1,122 officers were on the job by midmorning — police did little to stop the pandemonium on 12th Street. They were following what they believed were directions from superiors, and ultimately, Cavanagh, to use restraint. Badly outnumbered, officers conducted a sweep of the street, but the maneuver did nothing to control the crowd. Then they tried to isolate the area by erecting a perimeter. That also failed to work, and by 1 p.m., the crowd had swelled to about 10,000. Many were looting as police stood by.\n\nFelton Rogers Jr., a 26-year-old rookie cop, was among those sent to 12th Street on a bus. He said officers were issued riot gear and loaded shotguns, but told not to shoot the looters.\n\n\"As we approached, we could hear the burglar alarms going off constantly,\" Rogers recalled. \"We pulled up and it was a scene that you just couldn’t imagine. Windows were shattered and glass was out in the street. Merchandise from people looting was everywhere. There were tons of people just milling around.’’\n\nA festival-like feeling took hold along 12th Street. People carried stolen goods through the broken doors and shattered display windows of the street’s many stores.\n\nIn the first several hours after daylight, police did not shoot anyone, made few arrests and did not use tear gas. Meanwhile, the crowds grew, rowdiness continued and looting spread, the stolen goods ranging in size from from shoes to sofas. Lots of liquor was taken.\n\nBarbara Perryman, a college student in 1967, drove with her boyfriend to 12th Street from her Detroit home to see what was happening.\n\n“Just standing around watching people,” she told an interviewer. “They're breaking windows out and all — and I couldn't get over this — and then milling around.\n\n“So I turned around and looked in the grocery store. I said, ‘God, look at all those cookies on that shelf. Sure would like to take some cookies back to school.’ Next thing I know, some guy I did not know came up to me. ‘Here are your cookies!’ \"\n\nConrad Mallett Jr., the future chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court whose father, Conrad Mallett Sr., was a top Cavanagh aide, was a 13-year-old Free Press paperboy on 12th Street that Sunday morning, pulling a wagon and walking Hamlet, his Airedale terrier.\n\n“I saw a guy come out of a clothing store with 10 hats on his head, literally in a stack,” Mallett said.\n\nMany establishment black leaders fanned out through the neighborhood, pleading for calm. U.S. Rep. John Conyers, the Detroit Democrat who was then 38 and in his second term in Congress, climbed onto a car on 12th Street before noon Sunday with a bullhorn, asking the crowd to “stay cool.” Crowd members shouted him down, and someone threw a rock, which hit a cop. Conyers and his driver, civil right activist Arthur Johnson, were forced to flee.\n\n“You try to talk to those people and they’ll knock you into the middle of next year,” Conyers said later.\n\nThe first fire broke out in a 12th Street shoe store at 8:24 a.m., and fire crews battled it with no harassment.\n\nBy early afternoon, blazes raged out of control up and down 12th Street, spreading to Grand River Avenue, and it felt like someone was squeezing a bellows on the city — temperatures were in the high 80s, and 15-m.p.h. winds whipped the flames and spread the embers. The city smelled like smoke for miles, even in areas where no fires raged. Charred paper scattered in the wind and fell on distant neighborhoods.\n\n“I could hear the people screaming. Sirens filled the air,” John Lee Hooker, the late legendary blues singer who lived in Detroit, sang in “The Motor City Is Burning,” his post-riot song.\n\nAt some fire scenes, residents helped firefighters stretch hoses. At other places, members of the crowd pelted fire personnel with rocks and bottles and stole hoses off the trucks. At one point, the fire department radio dispatcher relayed a command from the chief to all crews operating without police protection:\n\n“Orders are to withdraw. Do not try to put out the fires. I repeat…”\n\n“A spirit of carefree nihilism was taking hold,” said the post-riot report from the government’s bipartisan Kerner Commission, which conducted an extensive investigation into Detroit’s tumult. “It appeared to one observer that the young people were dancing amid the flames.”\n\nLooting spread to nearby Linwood and Dexter avenues, crowded with stores like 12th Street.\n\nA media blackout and rumors\n\nBy early afternoon, with mayhem under way for about eight hours, Detroiters still had no official word that an extremely serious civil emergency was unfolding. Cavanagh and other leaders made no announcements, and they asked radio and television executives to sit on the story, arguing a media blackout would help them gain an upper hand.\n\nUntil late afternoon, when CKLW-TV in Windsor broke the embargo, rumors raced among Detroit’s 1.5 million residents as thick columns of black smoke rose over the west side. Many of the 34,623 fans at Tiger Stadium for the Tigers-Yankees doubleheader could see the smoke in the distance above left field.\n\nBroadcaster Ray Lane told historian Tim Kiska that Tigers General Manager Jim Campbell phoned with one instruction: “You are not, I repeat not, under any circumstances, to refer to the smoke over the left-field fence.\" Late in the second game, an announcement inside the stadium told fans to avoid certain streets, but did not provide an explanation.\n\nBy late afternoon, news of the riot was all over TV and radio. Most notably, WJLB-AM, one of Detroit’s black-oriented radio stations, on which Martha Jean (the Queen) Steinberg, ministers and officials spent hours pleading for calm.\n\nIn the vacuum of official information, people in well-off neighborhoods — from Detroit’s Boston-Edison district to the Grosse Pointes, which share a long border with the city — passed along stories that rampaging African Americans were heading to burn down their homes. Blacks in the riot area heard that a young man had been bayoneted and left on the street to bleed to death, which was never confirmed.\n\nThe disturbance generated fear all over: Normal life across Detroit came to a halt. Residents in besieged areas turned off their lights and got onto the floors of their homes, to stay below windows and out of reach of errant bullets. Black and white homeowners across the city and nearby suburbs moved their cars up their driveways and got their guns. Police in Dearborn and Grosse Pointe Park stood guard at their city’s borders with Detroit.\n\nDonald Lobsinger, a well-known anti-communist zealot who led a pugnacious group called Breakthrough, gathered gun-wielding acolytes at his home near Chandler Park, fearing Detroit’s many leftists would use the chaos as a cover to attack him. None of his adversaries appeared.\n\nAt the Fox Theatre on Sunday afternoon, Martha and the Vandellas was the headline act of a “Swinging Time Review” hosted by CKLW-TV’s Robin Seymour. Theater officials interrupted the Vandellas’ set and halted the show once they learned how dangerous Detroit’s streets had become. Martha Reeves explained the situation to fans, and they left the theater calmly.\n\nPolitical tests\n\nThe growing unrest tested Cavanagh, an ambitious Democrat, and Republican Gov. George Romney like nothing had before.\n\nRomney — who was planning to run for the Republican Party nomination for president in 1968 — and the mayor dithered in calling in the National Guard and Michigan State Police, partly because they feared being damaged politically if the public perceived they had lost control of Detroit.\n\nBut as the day wore on, it became increasingly apparent that Detroit was out of control, and the disturbance was growing by the hour. At 2:05 p.m., Girardin finally requested help from Michigan State Police. At 4:10 p.m., Romney called in the National Guard after he had received Cavanagh’s official request.\n\nThe disorder was rapidly spreading far beyond the near west side. By 4:30 p.m., firefighters had abandoned a 100-block area along 12th Street, waiting for state police or national guard protection. On Linwood Avenue on Sunday afternoon, the 68-year-old owner of a shoe repair store, Krikor Messerlian, who was barely 5 feet tall, grabbed a saber and attempted to defend a neighboring dry cleaners from a group of looting youths. After he cut one of the looters, another member of the gang beat Messerlian with a 30-inch piece of wood. Messerlian died four days later.\n\nLate Sunday afternoon, Cavanagh and other officials met at the 10th Precinct with black community leaders and neighborhood activists. Asked why it took so long to call in the guard and state cops, Cavanagh said: “Because they’re all white. We’re leery about that.”\n\nThe mayor added: “We don’t want another Newark here,” referring to the recently concluded disturbance in the New Jersey city in which 26 people died.\n\nAt the meeting, some Detroit residents and black officials complained about the restraint shown by police in the early hours, arguing a stronger reaction could have ended it. Cavanagh defended the city, saying there simply were not enough officers available to make a difference.\n\nCavanagh declared a 9 p.m.-5:30 a.m. curfew, and ordered the closing of bars and gas stations. The tunnel and bridge to Canada were shut down.\n\nTrying to get a handle on the size of the problem, Romney flew over Detroit between 8:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. and gazed down into the hazy, wet heat in horror.\n\n“It looked like the city had been bombed on the west side,” he said. “Entire blocks in flames.”\n\nAt 9:07 p.m., the first sniper fire was reported. Then people started dying.\n\n‘A riot of police against blacks’\n\nThe first reported death came just seconds after midnight Monday, heralding a day of escalating violence and confusion. Hamid Audish Yacoub, cruising around the neighborhood of Fourth and Temple in a 1965 burgundy Mustang, spotted Walter Grzanka, 45, coming through the broken window of Yacoub’s looted market. Yacoub fired a shot through the open car window and hit Graznka, who died 25 minutes later. In his pockets, Graznka had seven cigars, four packs of pipe tobacco and nine packets of shoelaces.\n\nSheren George, a 23-year-old mother of two and pregnant with her third child, was riding in the center of the front seat of a car with her husband and two brothers when a bullet ripped into her chest. The shot, from an unknown gunman, came from outside the car, at Woodward and Melbourne, about 11:30 p.m. Sunday. She was rushed to a hospital, where she died a couple of hours later. George was white; she and family members had just dropped off two black friends at Woodward and Grand Boulevard and were returning home.\n\n“Since there was this trouble, we thought Woodward would be safest,” said her brother, Paul Dimitrie.\n\nAt 3:30 a.m. Monday, John Ashby, a 24-year-old Detroit firefighter, was severely burned by a high-voltage wire. He died Aug. 3.\n\nBefore dawn on Monday, 800 state police officers and 1,200 Guardsmen had arrived in the city. Several thousand more members of the National Guard were on their way. The looting had now spread to 7 Mile and Livernois on the north and to Kercheval and Van Dyke on the east.\n\nNine people died of gunshots during daylight Monday, and many were wounded as bullets flew wildly in many neighborhoods.\n\nAt 4:30 p.m., at Baldwin and Harper, a red and white Oldsmobile 98 roared into an alley. Out jumped a 24-year-old white man, Richard Paul Shugar, armed with a shotgun. While Shugar owned no store, he accused a black man, Nathaniel Edmonds, 23, of looting and fired a shot, killing Edmonds. Shugar was later charged with murder.\n\nDetroit police, exhausted after working dangerous, 12-hour shifts and frustrated after being ordered to hold back Sunday, went on the offensive Monday. Officers shot 19 looting suspects, killing seven black men, and making more than 2,000 arrests that day alone.\n\nIn Detroit, as in some 150 other cities that experienced violence in 1967, “what had begun, to some degree, as a riots against police, became, in some degree, ‘a riot of police against blacks,’” wrote University of Michigan history professor Sidney Fine.\n\nWith the National Guard and police having little effect on the trouble, Republican Gov. Romney reached out to Vice President Hubert Humphrey in Washington at about 2:15 a.m. Monday to discuss using federal troops. Aides to Romney and Democratic President Lyndon Johnson — hamstrung by the political ambitions of their bosses — worked on the details of a deployment for several hours. Late Monday, Johnson ordered 4,700 crack paratroopers into Detroit as guardsmen and police battled snipers across the city.\n\nIt is so extraordinary to send in the U.S. Army for a local law-enforcement matter that the president went on national TV at midnight Monday to explain.\n\n“The fact of the matter is law and order have broken down in Detroit, Michigan,” Johnson said.\n\n“The city is an asylum,” wrote Jimmy Breslin, the famous New York Daily News columnist, who had traveled to Detroit to cover the story.\n\nNear the epicenter, on Taylor near 12th, Katie Thomas lived in fear.\n\n“It was like the whole world was on fire,” she said. “Twelfth Street was burning. Guns were going off and electricity was popping. I couldn’t sleep. I just laid there and cried.”\n\nFederal troops arrive\n\nFederal troops began taking back the streets of the lower east side in large numbers about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, some 10 hours after they arrived at Selfridge Air Base and 46 hours since the unrest had begun. Upon their arrival, their commanders, Lt. General John Throckmortin and Col. A.R. Bolling, observed “a city saturated with fear,” according to the Kerner Commission report.\n\n“The National Guardsmen were afraid, the residents were afraid, and the police were afraid. Numerous persons, the majority of them Negroes, were being injured by gunshots of undetermined origin. The general and his staff felt that the major task of the troops was to reduce fear and restore an air of normalcy,” the report said.\n\nShirley Davis, who was 19 in 1967, felt that horror when she saw tanks roll into her street as her southwest Detroit neighborhood became a battlefield.\n\n“Tanks! I had never seen a tank before in my life. I thought they came to shoot us, or to blow our houses up,” she told a Detroit Historical Museum interviewer. “I mean actual tanks. Big giant guns. And you’re sitting there and your heart is beating and you don’t know if you’re gonna live or die.”\n\nAbout 40% of the paratroopers were Vietnam veterans and nearly 25% were African Americans. The troops’ diversity, skill, no-nonsense demeanor, knack for public relations and strict discipline separated them from the trigger-happy weekend warriors in the old, ill-fitting National Guard uniforms. The Army quickly subdued Kercheval, Van Dyke, Vernor, Charlevoix, East Grand Boulevard, Mack and other east-side streets. But not every neighborhood east of Woodward was calm.\n\nDuring the night hours early Tuesday and Wednesday, snipers seemed ubiquitous on both the east and west sides. At Lawton and Carter, a vicious battle between snipers and law enforcement unfolded around the darkened home of Lloyd Stone, a 49-year-old autoworker, who crawled across his living room floor as gunfire banged up and down his street.\n\n“Get in the house! Get back!” shouted a police officer over a loudspeaker, warning residents to seek cover.\n\n“They’re crazy,” Stone told a reporter. “That’s the only word for it. I haven’t seen anything like this since the Army.”\n\nWhile hidden assassins were one of the lethal dangers during the week, analysis during and after the riot concluded many of the gunshots that police and the National Guard took for sniper fire were rounds fired by their colleagues blocks away. Detroit police and guard troops often fired first and asked questions later; the Kerner Commission report cited buildings placed under siege by authorities “on the sketchiest reports of sniping.”\n\nJulius Dorsey was a 55-year-old security guard at a fruit market near his home by the Belle Isle Bridge. Two men and a woman approached him after midnight on Monday and ordered him to let them loot the market. Dorsey refused, and a standoff ensued.\n\nDorsey fired his gun three times into the air, scattering the looters, and they broke into a nearby store. Neighbors, thinking the looters were armed, called police. When police and Guardsmen arrived, they chased the looters northward, firing their guns. The looters escaped, but the bullets hit Dorsey, and he died.\n\nOn Tuesday night came a horrific example of misguided shooting during the assault on a building at 12th and Euclid. National Guard troops were on alert because they believed their 2½ ton tank had come under sniper fire. One Guardsman saw the flash of what he thought was a weapon in a second-floor apartment window, so he responded with the tank’s .50-caliber machine gun. Bullets slammed into the chest of 4-year-old Tonia Blanding, killing her and nearly severing the arm of her aunt. The flash the guardsman saw in the darkened apartment likely was Tonia’s uncle striking a match to light a cigarette.\n\n“They shot all through the building,” a young, unidentified black man told WXYZ-TV the next day. “They even ran through the building and shot up through the floors. After they took us out and put us on the street, they talked about how they should kill all of us.”\n\nOn Wednesday, in an attempt to flush out suspected snipers, Detroit police and National Guard members fired more than 80 rounds into the Harlan House Motel, on the John Lodge Service Drive near West Grand Boulevard. One guest, Helen Hall, a 50-year-old businesswoman from Connecticut, stood at a fourth-floor window, telling her companions to come look at the tanks. A slug hit her in the heart and killed her instantly.\n\nThe Algiers Motel\n\nAlso Wednesday, sniper fire was reported around the Algiers Motel, a ramshackle establishment at Woodward and Virginia Park with a reputation for drugs and prostitution. Detroit cops, state police, National Guard soldiers and a security guard stormed the motel.\n\nNo weapon was ever found, nor evidence that any snipers had been hiding in the motel — though one of the guests might have fired a starter’s pistol during horseplay. By the time law enforcement personnel departed, three young black men — Carl Cooper, 17; Fred Temple, 18, and Auburey Pollard, 19 — were dead. Several of their friends, plus two white women from Ohio, had been assaulted during a chaotic and brutal lobby interrogation.\n\nThe killings became the most infamous episode of the week, a symbol of the uprising’s ruthlessness, especially after it was determined that two of the victims had been shotgunned at close range.\n\nJohn Hersey, an internationally famous author in that era, described the killings in his 1968 book, “The Algiers Motel Incident.” Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar Award-winning director, uses the Algiers as the focus of her film, “Detroit,” scheduled to have its world premiere at the Fox Theatre on Tuesday and open nationally Aug. 4. Danielle McGuire, a critically acclaimed author and former Wayne State University history professor, is writing a book on what happened at the Algiers.\n\nThe police “really freaked out,” in the motel, McGuire said: “By the end of the chaos…all evidence pointed to an execution, rather than some kind of shootout between snipers and the police.”\n\nA regional trauma\n\nThe violence subsided gradually. Sniping continued to bedevil police and National Guard troops on the west side, especially in the 12th Street area, but the 505 riot-related incidents from 6 p.m. to midnight Wednesday were about half the number of Monday night, 984. The east side, patrolled by paratroopers, was relatively quiet.\n\n“I think we have the city under control,” Throckmorton, the paratrooper commander, said Wednesday.\n\nOne outbreak of gunshots from snipers that took place about 4 p.m. Wednesday around 12th and Clairmount momentarily trapped an unlikely sightseer — Orville Hubbard, the longtime mayor of Dearborn, who was known for his strident segregationist views. Hubbard, in a two-car convoy, was making a tour of the riot areas, accompanied by a Dearborn police inspector with a Thompson submachine gun and a reporter from the Dearborn Press, among others.\n\nAs the shooting continued, the Hubbard party sped away. Looking at a young black man walking down a street, minding his own business, Hubbard was quoted as saying, “Look at that guy over there. I think he’d shoot you for two cents. You can tell they just hate whites.”\n\nEarlier, at a news conference, Hubbard had pledged that Dearborn police would “shoot on sight” any rioters who happened to cross the city’s long border with Detroit.\n\n“When you have mad dogs running loose, you’ve got to bring them under control with brute force,” he said.\n\nIn Detroit, police shot a white looter Wednesday who was stealing from an auto parts store north of Hamtramck. On the west side, Albert Robinson, a 38-year-old factory worker, died when police and guardsmen said snipers were shooting from Robinson’s apartment building. Authorities claimed Robinson was a sniper, but witnesses disagreed. No weapons were found in the building. Rumors spread that a Guardsman had bayoneted Robinson as he lay wounded on the ground, but an autopsy showed no such wounds.\n\nBy Thursday, much of the city was calm for the first time in five days. Many Detroiters and suburbanites were exhausted, sad, scared, confused and angry. And they also were curious about what had happened. Such large crowds and cars jammed 12th Street and other battered neighborhoods Thursday that Romney felt forced to reinstate the 9 p.m.- 5:30 a.m. curfew to control traffic and allow cleanup crews access.\n\nThe sights of soldiers, tanks, streets glittering with glass and smoking piles of rubble where busy businesses once stood were so much more harsh in person than on TV, and the images left many people feeling disoriented and ill.\n\nThe stats startled the world: 43 dead (33 African Americans and 10 whites); 1,189 injured; 7,231 arrests, of which 14% were white; 2,509 stores looted or burned; and 3,034 calls for fire department service. Of all structure fires, perhaps as many as 27% took place in black-owned businesses, according to historian Sidney Fine.\n\n“The catastrophe which has struck Detroit is a disaster by any reasonable definition of that term,” Romney said.\n\nOn Thursday, Cavanagh assembled at city hall 500 Detroiters, from Henry Ford II, UAW President Walter Reuther, department store chief J.L. Hudson Jr. to numerous community and neighborhood leaders. The mayor would appoint Hudson, then 35, to lead a city rebuilding committee, which would become New Detroit Inc.\n\n“We had to have something like this to wake us up to the fact that we have a revolution going on,” said Anthony Locricchio, an antipoverty activist. “We knew this would be bad, but we didn’t know it would be this bad.”\n\nReuther, one of the era’s most liberal and influential labor leaders, had counseled presidents Johnson and John F. Kennedy and directed UAW funds to help finance the civil rights movement in the South. He delivered a passionate speech at the city hall meeting, summoning the hope that many Detroiters were searching for.\n\n“What are we trying to do with this thing we call the American Dream?” Reuther asked the crowd. “We are trying to build a society in which we can harmonize the diversity — the many splendored diversity — of the human family, of all kinds of people, and to weld them into a sense of unity and solidarity.\n\n“This has never been done before. There are no blueprints that we can lift out of the history books, because no other people have ever had the challenge, or the opportunity. There is little we can do about yesterday. But there is much that we can about tomorrow.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/23"}]}

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to a low of minus 14 on Thursday morning. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Temperatures will be running 40 degrees below normal for these places. The combination of cold temperatures and windy conditions will send wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the upcoming “historic low temperatures” across the state, with near zero or negative digit wind chills by midday on Friday.\n\nGreg Behrens, of Des Moines, Iowa, tries to stay warm as he makes his way on a snow-covered sidewalk, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nThe declaration will help “ensure that essential supplies, especially propane can be delivered for both commercial and residential needs,” the governor told reporters.\n\n“Communities across the state are about to see temperatures that they haven’t experienced in a decade or more,” Kemp said.\n\nThe state will be pretreating roads and bridges in anticipation of the inclement weather and officials urged residents to avoid travel if possible.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear also declared a state of emergency, with wind gusts expected to reach 40 to 50 mph on Friday and minus 10 to minus 26 degrees wind chills expected on Saturday. Beshear asked residents to stay off roads and to have a backup heat source.\n\nJackson and Birmingham will both spend more than 80 hours below freezing between Friday and Monday. Houston could sit below freezing for 46 hours between Thursday and Saturday.\n\nThe cold temperatures will stay through Christmas weekend, before finally moderating next week.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Jennifer Gray", "Aya Elamroussi", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/25/ian-could-become-major-hurricane-targets-florida-what-we-know/8113790001/", "title": "Ian could become 'major' hurricane, targets Florida.

Melbourne resident Pat Alderman wasn't taking any changes, buying ten 50-pound bags of sand, along with 50 empty sandbags, at Lowe's in West Melbourne to fortify her back patio door against floodwaters. She has a backyard pond, and her soils are saturated with recent rainfall.\n\nAlderman, shopping at Lowe's on Sunday, said she had a generator and roll-down shutters – no need to board her windows.\n\n\"This is from decades of living in Florida,\" she said. 'If you've lived here for a while, you need to have all these things. Transplants don't understand.\"\n\nIn Tampa, stocking up on water and sandbags\n\nJohn Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at hurricane center, said Floridians should begin preparations, including gathering supplies for potential power outages, he said.\n\n\"For those in Florida, it’s still time to prepare,\" he said. \"I’m not telling you to put up your shutters yet or do anything like that, but it’s still time to get your supplies.\"\n\nTampa Mayor Jane Castor said city sandbag sites were open. She urged residents to shop for several days of necessities now and to check family disaster kits and plans.\n\n\"Are you #TampaReady?\" she tweeted. \"It’s never too early to prepare.\"\n\nResidents agreed.

The agency said it would \"prioritize the agency’s people and hardware.\" NASA managers, who canceled a launch set for Tuesday due to the storm, planned to meet Sunday night to evaluate whether to keep the vehicle at the launch pad to preserve an opportunity for a launch attempt on Oct. 2.\n\nThe latest information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Space Force, and the National Hurricane Center indicated a \"slower moving and potentially more westerly track of the storm than yesterday’s predictions showed, providing more time for the agency’s decision making process,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nBethune-Cookman University orders evacuation\n\nBethune-Cookman University canceled classes Monday and said they would reconvene remotely on Tuesday.\n\n\"As a precaution, and in the interest of safety for members of our campus community, the university has issued a mandatory campus evacuation,\" the school said in a statement on its website. The school, a private, historically black university in Daytona Beach, has about 2,750 undergraduate students.\n\nThe school told its students that their smartphones are “computers” and that they should continue to use their cellphones to keep up with their studies in the event they do not have access to a tablet, laptop or desktop technology.\n\nFlorida's west coast could take rare hurricane hit\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists are warning that the storm could slam the west coast of Florida – an often-missed target. The U.S. database shows that about 160 hurricanes, excluding tropical storms, have affected Florida. Only 17 have made landfall on the west coast north of the Florida Keys.\n\nMost storms typically travel northeast or northwest, not up the coast, AccuWeather senior weather editor Jesse Ferrell said. There is no record of a hurricane ever having tracked entirely up the west coast of Florida since records began in 1944. But Ian appears likely to take a \"very unusual track,\" he said.\n\nFlorida has had recent storms that were hurricanes, but were downgraded to tropical storms before landfall, Ferrell said. Elsa in 2021 made landfall west of Tampa, and Eta in 2020 made landfall north of Tampa in Cedar Key. Neither had the firepower close to a Category 3 storm, however.\n\nDeSantis declares statewide state of emergency\n\nFlorida Gov.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-power-outages-sunday/index.html", "title": "Prolonged winter storm causes at least 37 deaths and leaves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe prolonged winter storm that brought heavy snow, high winds and brutal cold to most of the US this past week has killed at least 37 people and had hundreds of thousands without power on Christmas morning.\n\nPerhaps the worst impact was around Buffalo, New York, where 43 inches of snow fell as of Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The snowfall and blizzard conditions made roads impassable, froze power substations and left more than a dozen people dead, Erie County officials said.\n\nThe conditions eased slightly on Sunday, allowing emergency responders to get out and see the extent of the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to say that this is going to be it because that would be a fallacy for me to say that, because we know that there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than two days,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Sunday. “There are people in homes who are below freezing temperatures.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday.\n\nHochul said she will ask the federal government “for a declaration of emergency that’ll allow us to seek reimbursements for the extraordinary expenses of all the overtime and the fact that we brought in mutual aid from other parts of the state.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Powerful winter storm leaves first responders in need of rescue, official says 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nOther storm-related deaths have been reported in the country.

For our latest coverage of Hurricane Ian, see updates from Friday, Sept. 30.\n\nClick here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nIan became a hurricane again Thursday evening after hammering Florida with heavy rains and powerful winds, leaving a rising death toll and thousands of residents desperately seeking rescue from the effects of one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history.\n\nThe large system, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm on its way out of Florida and into the Atlantic ocean, is expected to head toward the Carolinas and Georgia. Ian's sustained winds increased to 85 mph late Thursday and it could bring \"life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds'' to those states, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the storm caused a \"500-year flooding event\" and said Coast Guard helicopters were plucking trapped residents from the roofs of homes. Communities across the state were or will be swamped by the overwhelming waters, he said.\n\n\"The impacts of this storm are historic and the damage that has been done is historic,\" DeSantis said. \"We've never seen a flood event like this, we've never seen a storm surge of this magnitude.\"\n\nAt least 14 people were reported dead in counties across the state, a number that's expected to rise substantially. Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. More than 1.9 million Florida homes and businesses were without power Thursday evening.\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses thus far range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nEven after Ian had weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to the Atlantic early Thursday, its outer bands were still buffeting the state. The storm flooded entire communities, leaving residents stranded in their homes after making landfall Wednesday with 150-mph maximum sustained winds – just 7 mph shy of a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale.\n\nMajor to record flooding will continue across central Florida and considerable flooding is expected in portions of the Carolinas and southern Virginia through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm previously tore into Cuba, killing two people and bringing down the entire country's electrical grid.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►President Joe Biden declared an emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal assistance for the state, according to a White House statement. Ian is located about 185 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina, and is moving north-northeast at 10 mph, the hurricane center said late Thursday.\n\n►The U.S. Coast Guard was searching for a group of more than 20 Cuban migrants after their boat sank in stormy weather near the Florida Keys. A U.S. Border Patrol agent tweeted that nine have been rescued and that the search for the rest continues.\n\n►Ian’s strength at landfall tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane when measured by wind speed to strike the U.S. It's tied with five other hurricanes that reached 150 mph — two in Florida, two in Louisiana and one in Texas.\n\n►Waffle House, known for always being open, said 35 outlets were shut down due to the storm as of Thursday morning.\n\n►Residents described the terror after a tornado tore through a condominium complex near Delray Beach on the Atlantic side of South Florida, ripping off roofs and turning over vehicles. \"I felt things blow past my head and face,\" resident Jim Travis said. \"When I opened the door, my apartment was destroyed.\" Read more.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES : Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\n: Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian. HURRICANE IAN TRACKER: Where is Ian headed? See the map.\n\nReenergized Ian expected to make landfall in South Carolina\n\nLike a villain in a horror movie, Ian is coming back to wreak havoc just when it seemed to go away.\n\nOnce a Category 4 hurricane, Ian was a tropical storm as it moved Thursday off the coast of Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean, where the warm water reenergized it. In the afternoon, Ian once again became a hurricane — meaning it packs winds of at least 74 mph — and is expected to make landfall once again, this time Friday in South Carolina.\n\nHurricane and storm surge warnings have been issued for the South Carolina coast because of Ian's predicted approach, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nForecast call for a storm surge of several feet and flooding in low areas along the coast, like Charleston, where Mayor John Tecklenburg warned residents: “Take this storm seriously. Tomorrow, stay home and stay out of harm’s way.”\n\nCollapsed causeway, shark swimming on a street part of Ian's legacy\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast were devastated as Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nSanibel Island in Lee County, near where the hurricane made landfall, was among the hardest hit. Parts of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed, disconnecting the barrier island of 6,300 residents from the mainland.\n\n“Sanibel is destruction ... it got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said.\n\nSanibel Island officials said two people died as a result of the hurricane. At a Thursday night news conference, the officials said members of at least 200 households remained on the island during the storm. At least 40 uninjured people were evacuated and another 12 injured ones were taken to hospitals.\n\nIn Fort Myers, the water on the streets of one neighborhood was so deep a shark was seen swimming through it. In Cape Coral just to the south, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water.\n\nAbout 70 miles north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.\n\nAt least 14 deaths confirmed in Florida, toll expected to grow\n\nThe destruction and upheaval left behind by Ian has made it difficult to get an accurate assessment of the loss of life, but there are already reports of 14 deaths, and more are expected.\n\nTwo of them were reported by officials in Sanibel Island, where residents of at least 200 households declined to evacuate and rode out the storm.\n\nCharlotte County Commissioner Chris Constance told CNN Thursday afternoon there have been six confirmed fatalities in the county, which is just north of Fort Myers.\n\nAlso speaking to CNN, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said at least five deaths have been confirmed in his county, which includes Cayo Costa — the island near Cape Coral where the storm made landfall Wednesday.\n\nAnd a 72-year-old man in Deltona, about 30 miles northeast of Orlando, died after falling into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nConstance said four shelters in his county had to be evacuated because of structural damage, and many roads were impassable because of downed power lines or flooding.\n\n“It is the biggest catastrophe I have ever seen in my lifetime,” said Constance, speaking from Broward County in South Florida, where he traveled ahead of the storm. “This is unprecedented and I was in Punta Gorda through Hurricane Charley (in 2004). While that was devastating, this is so much bigger, is affecting so many more people.''\n\nBiden: Ian could be 'deadliest hurricane in Florida's history'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that Ian could be the “deadliest hurricane in Florida's history,” vowing the federal government will provide assistance “however long it takes” to ensure a full recovery.\n\n“The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life,” Biden said after he was briefed on FEMA’s disaster response at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.\n\nAt least 13 people were reported dead in counties across the state, though Florida officials have not provided an official death total from the storm. It wasn’t clear on what Biden based his estimate on the loss of life. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane killed up to 2,500 in Florida. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 killed 43 people.\n\n“We know many families are hurting today, and our entire country hurts with them.'' Biden said. \"My message to the people of Florida and to the country is that at times like these America comes together.”\n\nThe president said he offered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “the fullest federal support” in a phone conversation Thursday morning and told Florida mayors to “call me directly” if they need help.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHurricane Ian losses: $25-$40 billion\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses, mostly in Florida, range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nFitch said the losses could climb higher “depending on the effect of the storm in the Carolinas.” The storm made landfall Wednesday on the Gulf Coast and traveled across central Florida before exiting on Thursday as a tropical storm. It has since turned into a Category 1 storm and headed toward South Carolina.\n\nIn comparison to other storms, Fitch said Hurricane Katrina’s losses were $65 billion in 2005 and Hurricane Ida’s losses were $36 billion last year.\n\n- Sergio Bustos\n\nIan the 'ultimate villain' at Disney World; parks to start reopening Friday\n\nWhile Disney World was closed to guests Thursday as Ian swept across central Florida, some who were already staying at the park's resorts weathered the storm with limited staff and upset children.\n\nJan Tuckwood, who splits time between Lake Worth, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, said Disney's Swan Reserve hotel felt like the Twilight Zone to her and her family.\n\n\"Disney World is as you would imagine it to be if an incredible amount of children have been pent up for two days and basically had their hopes dashed by the ultimate villain, Hurricane Ian,\" she said.\n\nDuring the storm, water started leaking into their hotel room on the 14th floor and they were relocated to another room, she said.\n\nDisney officials said the parks were being assessed for damage Thursday and operations would resume in a phased approach Friday.\n\n– Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nErosion-control rocks tossed by high surf\n\nIn Flagler Beach, county emergency officials reported damage to the end of the pier as a result of the high and pounding surf, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said, adding that public reports indicated the surf was tossing erosion-control rocks over the beachside highway State Road A1A.\n\nAt Pellicer Creek near Marineland, the tide gauge reached a height of 4 feet over the high-water mark, which represents major flooding of the Intracoastal Waterway, as a result of storm surge. A Weatherstem camera showed flooding of the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience.\n\n-- Dinah Pulver\n\nIan as viewed through a peephole in North Port\n\nElizabeth Hayes watched the entirety of Hurricane Ian pass over her home in North Port, 50 miles northwest of Fort Myers, through a peephole in her shutters. The longtime resident says she was not prepared for the devastating flooding – and she knows more floodwater is on its way.\n\nHeyes said only the roof of her shed in the yard is above water. North Port residents are using small boats, kayaks and paddle boards to inspect homes that flooded along the Myakkahatchee Creek on Thursday morning.\n\n“We’ve seen it flood, we’ve boated in and out before, but this is devastating,” Hayes said.\n\nAirports closed, flights canceled\n\nMost Florida airports remained closed Thursday and numerous flights were canceled. Airports that are open are dealing with delays as well as cancellations.\n\nNearly 2,000 U.S. flights were canceled Thursday, and the highest numbers were across Florida, according to Flight Aware, which tracks flight status in real time. Travel through parts of Georgia and the Carolinas was also impacted as the storm moved north. Tampa International Airport officials tweeted that damage assessments were underway.\n\n\"We are closely coordinating our reopening with the FAA, TSA, airlines, and other partners based on roadway safety, facility readiness, and required staffing,\" the post said. \"We hope to have an update on reopening plans later today.\"\n\n– Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nSection of Sanibel Causeway crashes into sea\n\nA section of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed into San Carlos Bay, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people normally live. A mandatory evacuation order had been issued for the island ahead of the storm but authorities said about 200 households stayed behind.\n\nDeSantis said Thursday morning that more than 100 engineers in pairs of two will work to assess the bridges along the west coast of Florida.\n\nBiden issues disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration to make federal funding available to affected residents in the Florida counties of Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota. DeSantis said he would ask that the declaration be expanded as more counties report crippling damage from Ian.\n\nAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help residents and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding also is available for debris removal.\n\nBiden said his administration was \"continuing to take swift action to help the families of Florida. ... I want the people of Florida to know that we will be here at every step of the way.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg dodged worst of Ian\n\nAfter thousands of people evacuated earlier this week, preparing for life-threatening storm surge, residents in St. Petersburg awoke Thursday to minimal damage.\n\nPolice directed traffic at intersections with broken traffic lights. Some trees had fallen, blocking roadways and taking down power lines. In Coquina Key, an island community south of downtown, a Norfolk Island pine had snapped in half, its branches scattered in a yard. Nearby, Dale Fredrick used a chainsaw to cut branches of another downed tree blocking a roadway.\n\n“It won’t take long,” Fredrick, 58, said. “Just little by little.”\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nUSA TODAY's Hurricane Ian tracker will remain updated and offer the latest look at where the storm is headed.\n\nLee County sheriff fears 'hundreds' could be dead but DeSantis says nothing confirmed\n\nThe hurricane’s center made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of heavily populated Fort Myers in Lee County.\n\n\"While I don't have confirmed numbers, I definitely know the fatalities are in the hundreds,\" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said on ABC-TV's \"Good Morning America.\" \"There are thousands of people that are waiting to be rescued.\"\n\nPressed on the numbers, Marceno said, \"So far confirmed in the hundreds. Meaning that we are responding to events, drownings. Again, unsure of the exact details because we are just starting to scratch the surface on this assessment.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis attempted to downplay the sheriff's assessment, telling \"Good Morning America'' those numbers weren't verified.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\n“None of that is confirmed,” DeSantis said at a morning briefing at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “What that is, there were 911 calls from people in their homes saying, ‘Hey, the water is rising. I’m going to go up in the attic, but I’m really worried.’”\n\n“Of course, those folks now are going to be checked on,” DeSantis said. “I think you’ll have more clarity about that in the next day or so, as (rescuers) are able to go to those locations and determine whether people need services.”\n\nMore than 1.9M Floridians without power\n\nMore than 1.9 million homes and businesses across Florida were without power Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of the homes and businesses in 12 counties were without power, although authorities said they were making progress in restoring electricity.\n\nDeSantis said the power grids in Lee and Charlotte counties will likely have to be rebuilt.\n\n\"Lee and Charlotte are basically off the grid at this point,\" DeSantis said. \"That's going to be more than just connecting a power line back to a pole.\"\n\nHospital roof partially torn off, fire station flooded: Damage in Florida\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast saw major damage as Hurricane Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire-Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water. In Cape Coral, about 30 miles up the coast, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nNearby Fort Myers saw intense storm surge flooding coastal communities and the area around WINK News, a local CBS affiliate. Videos showed water reaching car windshields in the studio's parking lot and some of the storm surge leaking into the building.\n\nFarther north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital. Staff members used towels and plastic bins to try to mop up the sodden mess.\n\nOfficials warned flash floods were possible across the state, which could lead to pollution and radioactive waste overflow.\n\nSAFFIR-SIMPSON WIND SPEED SCALE:Breaking down wind speed scale for hurricanes.\n\nHOW DOES HURRICANE IAN COMPARE:Category 5 hurricanes are rare.

Buffalo had already picked up over 14 inches of snow by early afternoon, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"Heavy snow at the Buffalo airport this morning has already established a record for the date,\" the National Weather Service tweeted Thursday.\n\nIn the South, Nashville was also seeing snow Thursday: \"Snow has spread across much of Middle Tennessee including Nashville Metro, and travel is deteriorating quickly,\" the National Weather Service in Nashville tweeted. \"1-2 inches per hour could fall at times.\"\n\nThursday was the snowiest day in Nashville since Jan. 22, 2016, when 8 inches of snow fell in one day, according to AccuWeather.

Metro Nashville Police reported accidents and other driving woes that snarled and slowed several roads. Police reported dozens of wrecks on the roads by early afternoon.\n\nAlong the Kentucky border, authorities in Montgomery County, Tennessee, were dealing with dozens of crashes as well, including a wreck that killed one person involving a commercial vehicle on Interstate 24.\n\nSchools around the region canceled classes, including a closure through Friday for Nashville’s public school students. Parts of Maryland and Virginia were awaiting the storm, which was due to roll in Thursday afternoon and evening.\n\nIn and around Washington, D.C., where more than a foot of snow fell in some places Monday, up to 3 inches more snow was forecast Thursday night into Friday.\n\nWHAT IS A BOMB CYCLONE?:The weather phenomenon is basically a winter hurricane\n\nVirginia officials sought to reassure the public Thursday as they reacted to harsh criticism of their response to a snowstorm earlier this week that left hundreds of motorists stranded on Interstate 95 in frigid temperatures.\n\nCrews in Virginia worked through Tuesday to free up a roughly 50-mile traffic jam on I-95 that trapped scores of drivers in their cars for more than 24 hours. More than 100,000 Virginia homes and businesses remained without power Thursday from Monday's storm.\n\n\"These back-to-back storms will generate landmark winter weather that requires extra flexibility, particularly as many continue to deal with power outages,\" said Gov. Ralph Northam, who declared a state of emergency and has formally asked the Virginia National Guard for assistance ahead of the latest storm.\n\nNortham also pushed back against the criticism, questioning why drivers were out in force on the highways Monday when they had been warned to stay home.\n\nVirginia lawmakers, local officials, at least two members of Congress and the AAA auto club called for action. Stafford County Board of Supervisors Chair Crystal Vanuch, a Republican and lifelong county native, said Thursday that the gridlock was “probably the biggest disaster we’ve ever seen.”\n\nAccording to Vanuch, the county’s emergency operations command received roughly 1,800 calls for service over a 24-hour period — more than five times the normal amount — and local emergency workers told her they weren’t getting the help they needed from state officials.\n\nNortham, a Democrat who leaves office later this month, said in an uncharacteristically combative interview that he was “getting sick and tired of people talking about what went wrong.”\n\nHe told radio station WRVA that no one was injured and that people should be thanking first responders and emergency workers.\n\n'AN OUTRAGE': Why drivers were left stranded overnight, some for 24 hours, on I-95 in Virginia\n\nUp to a foot of snow could sweep across parts of Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, if the storm strengthens fast enough, AccuWeather said. Boston was expecting up to 8 inches.\n\n\"This will be a disruptive storm, and since cold air will be preceding the storm, snow will accumulate on roads as soon as it starts,” AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nICE CAUSES DEADLY TRAFFIC ISSUES: Virginia's Gov. Northam declares state of emergency\n\nLake-effect snow bands were already slamming Buffalo and surrounding areas of western New York on Thursday, producing snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Gusty winds up to 25 mph were also creating limited visibility and dangerous travel conditions along stretches of Interstate 90.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad, however: The storm presented a boon to the ski industry in West Virginia, where up to 8 inches of snow was forecast. Three of the state’s four major downhill ski resorts had suspended on-slope operations earlier this week because of warmer conditions. Now the activity was picking back up.\n\n“West Virginia can’t wait to welcome travelers to our snow-capped mountains this winter,” said Chelsea Ruby, secretary of the state’s Department of Tourism.\n\nElsewhere, in the Upper Midwest, parts of Michigan were buried under a foot of snow, with more expected into Friday. Minnesota and Wisconsin were expecting less snow, but wind chills of minus 25 to minus 35 will continue into Friday morning across much of the state, the weather service said.\n\nDangerously cold temperatures enveloping North Dakota have pushed wind chill readings down to minus 59 degrees in Bowbells, the county seat of Burke County in northwestern North Dakota.\n\nAnd a powerful storm was pounding parts of Colorado on Thursday with what could reach 16 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said. In some areas, winds were gusting to 55 mph.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/24/winter-storm-updates-deaths-crashes-power-outages/10950466002/", "title": "Winter storm updates: Deaths reported; widespread power outages", "text": "A powerful winter storm kept pummeling the United States on Christmas Eve with dangerously cold temperatures and heavy snow – leaving in its wake fatal car crashes, thousands of canceled flights and millions at risk for future power outages.\n\nThe massive footprint of the winter weather and its timing during a busy holiday travel week makes the arctic blast particularly dangerous. The National Weather Service on Friday said its warnings and advisories covered about 200 million people – \"one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” forecasters said.\n\nNationwide, officials have attributed at least 18 deaths to the storm.\n\nIn Ohio, about 50 vehicles were involved in a pileup that killed at least 4. An 82-year-old woman was found dead outside of her assisted care facility in Michigan on Friday amid dangerously cold temperatures. And in the Buffalo, New York, area – which received stunning records of rain and snowfall on Friday – two people died in their homes after emergency responders couldn't reach them amid the city's historic blizzard conditions.\n\nCOLD WEATHER AND GLOBAL WARMING: Freezing temps don't disprove climate change\n\nTRAVEL:More than 5,000 US flights canceled amid winter storm. What to know about waivers.\n\nThe winter weather's dangers are often localized and not limited to snowfall. In New York, blizzard conditions created whiteouts and stranded motorists on the state's western side while flooding prompted water rescues on the eastern side.\n\nMeanwhile, bone-numbing wind chills extended throughout the country. Every state in the contiguous U.S. will experience minimum wind chills below freezing on Christmas or before, the weather service says.\n\nOnly a few regions in the U.S. are expected to escape bitter cold over Christmas — parts of California, Oregon, Arizona and Florida are among the few spots in the nation that won't experience wind chills below freezing, the weather service predicts.\n\nPHOTOS:Intense winter storm blows across the US with blizzards and bitter cold\n\nOther impacts from the storm kept accumulating Saturday. Power outage reports swelled up to some 1.7 million Saturday morning before falling significantly in the afternoon – and thousands of flights were canceled amid a busy holiday travel season.\n\n\"Severe weather across the country led to more than 20% of flights being canceled (Friday). Impacts continue today but FAA expects that the most extreme disruptions are behind us as airline and airport operations gradually recover,\" U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg wrote on Twitter Saturday.\n\nButtigieg also noted that \"many Amtrak services have been canceled or delayed as well.\" He cautioned those traveling by car this weekend to observe local warnings and weather hazards.\n\nWhen will the winter storm be over?\n\nNot before Christmas.\n\nFederal forecasters expect a huge mass of cold air to continue affecting the nation into next week. Those temperatures are a concern from the Dakotas to Florida even on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"Wind chills will still bottom out in the 20s and low 30s Monday and Tuesday morning for most locations in the South outside of south Florida,\" a Friday forecast says.\n\nBut low temperatures are forecasters' primary concern for most of the country by Monday. Flooding, rain and other hazards are only expected to affect more localized regions.\n\nNY governor says storm is 'one of the worst in history'; record Buffalo snow\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul described the snowstorm hitting western parts of the state, particularly the Buffalo area, as \"one of the worst in history\" at a press briefing Saturday morning.\n\nHochul, who issued a statewide State of Emergency that went into effect early Friday, also pointed to the storm's impact on transportation hazards and emergency response. Every fire truck in Buffalo, she said, was stranded and stuck in snow as of Saturday morning.\n\n\"No matter how many emergency vehicles we have, they cannot get through the conditions as we speak,\" Hochul said.\n\nAccording to the weather service, Buffalo reported a daily snowfall of 22.3 inches Friday – almost doubling the old record of 12.6 inches set in 1976. The city also reported 1.98 inches of rain on Friday, surpassing the 1876 record of 1.73 inches.\n\nWatch:'Zero-Mile' visibility as Buffalo Airfield closes on night before Christmas Eve\n\n\"In Buffalo, this storm will likely at least jump near the top of the list of worst blizzards in the city’s history, if not even becoming the worst,\" meteorologist Jake Sojda said in an AccuWeather article. \"Four to 6 feet of snow will fall by Sunday and coupled with wind gusts approaching hurricane force (74 mph or greater) to create enormous drifts and impossible travel.\"\n\nIn addition to Hochul's declaration, Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown issued a State of Emergency beginning Friday morning.\n\n\"I’ve never seen the likes of this kind of storm,” Colleen Darby, 59, a lifelong resident of the area, told The Associated Press. \"I can’t even get out of my house right now. The snow is up to my chest.\"\n\nHochul said on Saturday that she will also ask the federal government for an emergency declaration, which would allow New York to seek reimbursements for the \"extraordinary expenses\" undertaken with overtime, mutual aid brought in from around the state and the deployment of crews responding to the unprecedented storm.\n\nThousands of flight delays, cancellations on Christmas Eve\n\nTravelers heading to airports on Christmas Eve are facing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nFlightAware, an online tracker, reported Saturday as of 4:00 p.m. ET, more than 6,100 delays and over 2,600 cancellations for flights within, into or out of the U.S.\n\nFlightAware's \"Misery Map\" showed more than 900 delays and over 250 cancellations seen between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. ET Saturday – with Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Denver International Airport experiencing the highest number of flight delays and cancellations as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nFriday saw even more flights impacted – with FlightAware reporting a total more than 11,500 U.S. flight delays and over 5,900 U.S. flight cancellations.\n\nPower outages hit more than 1 million homes, business early Saturday\n\nOn Saturday, power outages impacted more than a million electric customers across the country, according to the website PowerOutage.us, which tracks utility reports.\n\nReports swelled to about 1.7 million before falling significantly Saturday afternoon. North Carolina and Maine reported the highest number of power outages Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn Tennessee and North Carolina, utility companies initiated controlled, temporary outages in efforts to save energy. Customers of Memphis, Light, Gas and Water and Duke Energy, for example, were impacted by these rolling blackouts Saturday morning.\n\nBoth companies confirmed that they were ending the temporary outages by mid-day Saturday. But similar action could still be taken in the future.\n\n\"The weather is still frigid and power demand may fluctuate. We are asking customers to be prepared in the event (the Tennessee Valley Authority) implements rolling blackouts. We could be required to do so at any time without notice. We are currently restoring power to all customers who are interrupted,\" Memphis, Light, Gas and Water CEO Doug McGowen said in a statement issued at 11 a.m. CT.\n\nPennsylvania-based PJM Interconnection said that, due to the severe weather, power plants were having difficulty operating – asking residents in 13 states to refrain from unnecessary use of electricity. The major electricity grid operator also warned the 65 million people it serves across the eastern U.S. that future rolling blackouts might be required.\n\nBe prepared::How to arm your home against power outages this winter\n\nAuthorities urge people to stay home in many areas\n\nLocal and state authorities in states including Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky have urged residents to limit travel.\n\nMichigan State Police on Friday warned travelers to stay off the roads.\n\n“Most roads are icy and impacted by blowing snow, which is causing low visibility,” police posted on Facebook. “If travel is not necessary, please stay home.”\n\nSome forecasters have said the storm's danger doesn't primarily come from the amount of snowfall — it's a combination of snow, wind, ice and frigid temperatures that were particularly concerning in some areas.\n\n\"Don't focus too much on the snow totals ... Significant blowing and drifting will be occurring. Avoid travel!\" the weather service in Buffalo said Friday afternoon.\n\nBomb cyclones are powerful winter storms. Here's a visual breakdown of how they're created.\n\nThe weather service office reported recieving numerous reports Friday night of people being stranded along roadways.\n\nWhat is the polar vortex?\n\nAccording to the weather service, the polar vortex is a giant, circular area of rotating cold air and low pressure that surrounds both of Earth's poles. In the U.S., focus remains on the North Pole's polar vortex – because it impacts weather in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nPeople may only talk about the polar vortex when it sends frigid temperatures south of the Arctic – but it always exists, the weather service notes, its strength changing between seasons.\n\nWhat is the polar vortex? In-depth look at how it can affect winter weather in the US.\n\nWhen the polar vortex is stable and strong, it typically stays near the North Pole. But when it weakens or splits, frigid air can escape, funneling freezing temperatures farther south to the U.S., Europe and Asia.\n\nWhat is wind chill?\n\nMeteorologists define wind chill as how cold it feels while outdoors, and it’s based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the wind-and-cold combination, according to the National Weather Service. Increased wind draws heat from the body, which then lowers the temperature of the skin and internal body.\n\n“Frostbite may develop on exposed skin in as few as 10-20 mins, and hypothermia can quickly develop if you're not dressed for the cold,” weather service experts in Chicago warned Thursday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

At least 31 people died in New York’s Erie County as the storm buried Buffalo in up to 50.3 inches of snow. At least 25 others across 11 US states have been reported dead in the storm.\n\n“We’re, unfortunately, finding bodies on the street and in snow banks,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening.\n\n>> GET LIVE UPDATES\n\nMore than 7,000 utility workers were working around the clock to restore power in the area, navigating through broken trees and poles, according to Twitter posts from Poloncarz and National Grid US.\n\nLocal health officials were urgently responding to medical requests, including arranging transportation for people who need dialysis treatments – many of which were disrupted or delayed because of the storm. “Dialysis isn’t an optional or elective treatment. It has to be done regularly – several times a week – or that person dies,” the Erie County health department said.\n\nBuffalo police, meanwhile, arrested at least eight people by Tuesday afternoon in connection with business break-ins during the storm.\n\nAnd efforts of firefighters and other emergency vehicles working in the area were hampered by the hundreds of vehicles abandoned in the snow across Buffalo after fierce blizzard conditions made for blinding drives over the Christmas weekend, officials said.\n\nA driving ban remained in effect in Buffalo amid a two-day effort to clear at least one lane on every street to accommodate emergency responders, Poloncarz said at a news conference.\n\n“There’s a lot of roads that are completely blocked right now, that have no access whatsoever. And people are trying to drive on these roads or trying to get into these neighborhoods, and they can’t,” Poloncarz said.\n\n“Please, please,” he said. “I’m begging: Stay home. If it’s an emergency situation, call 911.”\n\nA weary Buffalo on Tuesday after days of winter weather that left parts of the city impassable. Joed Viera/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDriving ban in effect; flood mitigation\n\nBuffalo could see up to another half an inch of snow into Tuesday night and a daytime high of 30 degrees falling to 27 at night in New York’s second-most populous city.\n\nBut temperatures are expected to rise throughout the rest of the week, and local officials are worried that may cause flooding.\n\nThe flood risk is small, according to the National Weather Service, which said that snow melting alone “rarely causes flooding.” And even though there’s light rain forecast for the region, “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nStill, the leader of Erie County’s Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Services said crews were working to prevent any possibility of floods.\n\nAs temperatures warm, authorities wanted “to make sure that we are cleared from curb to curb and as in many areas as possible so that when it melts it can run off and it can find its appropriate drainage,” commissioner Daniel Neaverth said.\n\nOther steps toward recovery include:\n\n• President Joe Biden on Monday approved an emergency declaration for New York, freeing up federal resources to help disaster relief efforts in Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n• One hundred military police from the New York National Guard are heading to Erie County, along with state police from other parts of New York, Poloncarz said. New Jersey state police will fill in for New York officers diverted to Buffalo, he said.\n\n• Buffalo Niagara International Airport is expected to stay closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said, after snow equipment was brought in from Pittsburgh to help it reopen.\n\n• More supermarkets in western New York were expected to reopen after road conditions had paralyzed earlier efforts to distribute stockpiled ready-to-eat meals to food banks, officials said.\n\n• Major highways – including the New York State Thruway, Interstates 20 and 990, and Routes 400 and 219 – have reopened, the state Transportation Department’s Rochester office announced.\n\nIt was a signal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a tweet, “that we are finally turning the corner on this once-in-a-generation storm.”\n\n‘Gut-wrenching’ effort to check on residents plods on\n\nThe storm in Buffalo has been deemed more ferocious than the blizzard of 1977, which left 23 people there dead. The weekend weather “was just horrendous,” Poloncarz said earlier. “And it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\nIndeed, blizzard conditions were recorded for 37.5 hours, CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said, noting, “That just doesn’t happen.”\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles were at times stuck in snow. “We had rescuers rescuing the rescuers,” Buffalo Deputy Mayor Crystal Rodriguez-Dabney told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, adding those problems have been resolved.\n\nHundreds of vehicles were abandoned in the snow in Buffalo, New York State Police Acting Superintendent Steven Nigrelli said, adding authorities were going door-to-door, car-to-car, checking for people.\n\nA utility worker straps a rope to a truck in an attempt to tow another in Buffalo, New York, on Monday. Joed Viera/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne reported death in Erie County was attributed to an EMS delay, while others involved people who were outside, in cars, had no heating or suffered cardiac arrest.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise, officials have said. Once roads are cleared, law enforcement planned to prioritize welfare checks, Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said Monday.\n\n“I have a bad feeling about that. I think the death toll is going to go up. When you have 420 EMS calls that are unanswered, it’s just gut-wrenching,” the sheriff said as his team planned to help get “people to doctors, nurses, to hospitals and … dialysis.”\n\nBy Tuesday evening, there were “just under 2,000” residents without power across Buffalo, Mayor Byron W. Brown said on Twitter, adding officials were still working to restore power to everyone.\n\nGetting the lights back on has been no easy task as utility crews have faced dangerous weather conditions, Hochul said.\n\nPeople and vehicles move about Monday on Main Street in Buffalo.

More than a foot more could fall Saturday, with winds gusting up to 65 mph and making temperatures feel well below zero.\n\nIn Erie County, which includes Buffalo, blizzard conditions are expected to continue through at least Sunday morning, County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Saturday. The winter storm could continue for at least the next 36 hours, with the blizzard warning in effect until 7 a.m. Christmas morning, Poloncarz said.\n\n“This is still a life-threatening situation,” he said. “This is nothing to be trifled with.”\n\nThe county’s Deputy Commissioner of Disaster Preparedness and Homeland Security, Gregory Butcher, said the storm will be significant “for days to come.”\n\nAbout 500 motorists found themselves stranded in their vehicles in Erie County Friday night into Saturday morning, and a “couple hundred” may still be trapped early Saturday afternoon, Poloncarz told CNN. That’s despite a county driving ban put in place during the storm.\n\nLia Belles’ 85-year-old grandmother and her father were among the stranded.\n\nThey have been stuck on New York State Route 198 in Buffalo – less than a mile from her home – since Friday afternoon. Contact with them is limited due to their phone battery, and they have been turning the heat on and off to save gas.\n\n“There is nothing more I want other than their safety right now,” Belles told CNN Saturday, adding that her dad could walk home but he would never leave his mother alone.\n\n“I’ve tried to walk out to them with a sled but conditions by myself were just impossible,” she said.\n\nBelles said by Saturday afternoon they got help getting the car unstuck but there was no path for them to leave.\n\n“It’s very nerve racking and difficult,” she said. “They’re definitely exhausted, but we’re seeing a little hope right now.”\n\nIn hardest-hit areas, many emergency crews that tried to reach the stranded became stuck themselves, Poloncarz said.\n\n“Don’t leave your home,” Poloncarz said on CNN Saturday to anyone thinking about traveling to or within the area. “It’s much safer to be inside, even if you lost your power with it only being 45 degrees inside, than going out and dealing with minus 20 wind chills and blinding conditions.”\n\nNational Guard troops were arriving Saturday to “rescue people that are stuck in vehicles,” and to give rides to medical workers so they could relieve colleagues who’d been working at hospitals for more than a day, Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo Diocese Bishop Michael W.

But nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices.\n\nIn the year through November, not adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices jumped 49%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince early this year, a deadly avian flu has been reducing poultry flocks — specifically turkeys and egg-laying hens. That’s one reason for the unrelenting increase in prices. But the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket.\n\nExperts think that the peak has passed, but until these conditions improve, expect to pay more for eggs in the grocery store.\n\nWholesale prices hit a record\n\nAvian flu has been a problem in the US for several months now, but in recent weeks wholesale prices have been hitting records.\n\nAs of last week, “prices have been escalating for nine consecutive weeks… setting new record highs on a daily basis since the week of Thanksgiving,” said Karyn Rispoli, editor of the Egg Price Current for Urner Barry, which offers food market data.\n\nOn Friday, Midwest large eggs, the benchmark for eggs sold in their shells, hit $5.46 per dozen, Rispoli said, citing Urner Barry’s data. This time last year, Urner Berry’s data shows, that price was around $1.70.\n\nEggs have gotten much more expensive this year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nOne reason for the increase? Not enough supply.\n\n“There’s simply not been enough production to support the incredibly strong retail demand we’ve seen this year,” Rispoli said. Supply has been constrained by the deadly bird flu.\n\nThe current outbreak of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza started in the US around February, and has persisted throughout the year. The last major bird flu outbreak in the United States was in 2015. But that one was contained by June of that year, noted Brian Earnest, lead economist for animal protein in CoBank.\n\n“This year, we’ve continued to see flock depopulations throughout the entire year, and there’s an expectation that we’ll continue to see it into 2023,” he said, noting that he expects “we’re going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward.”\n\nAbout 60 million birds are gone because of the disease so far, according to the USDA. Of those, about 43 million are egg-laying hens, according to USDA data provided by the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group which markets eggs.\n\nStill, farmers have been able to moderate the losses. “Our producers learned a lot of hard lessons from 2015,” said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board. Some farmers have been able to repopulate their flocks, decreasing the net impact on flock sizes and egg supplies. As of early December, there were about 308 million hens laying eggs for consumption, down from about 328 million in December 2021, according to the USDA.\n\nThe supply squeeze isn’t the only thing contributing to higher egg prices, said Metz. Higher fuel, feed and other producer cost are also driving up wholesale prices, she said. And then there’s that high demand for eggs, which spikes this time of year.\n\nEgg demand remains high\n\nPeople buy more eggs around the holidays, when they’re baking and cooking more, and eating breakfast at home more often.\n\nWholesale prices tend to go up in the winter because of those habits, noted Earnest. That has “brought about a very strong market condition.”\n\nYear-round demand for eggs has also also been strong.\n\nEven while prices have soared, sales of eggs have only ticked down about 2% by unit in retail in the year through December 4th, according to data from IRI, a market research firm.\n\nShoppers have been accepting high prices at the grocery store as they pull back on restaurant visits. And even though eggs have gotten more expensive, they still cost less than other proteins.\n\nA deadly avian flu has led to the death of millions of poultry this year. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAs that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.\n\n“Based on current trade values and market conditions, it appears that the market may have finally reached its peak,” said Rispoli. Friday’s wholesale prices were the same as Thursday’s, the first time pricing held steady since October, she said.\n\n“Several suppliers have reported to us… that they are seeing their orders slow,” in the week leading up to Christmas, she added. By then, “most grocers have pulled in whatever inventory they’ll need for the holidays.”\n\nIt might take another three to six months for prices to moderate in retail, said KK Davey, president of thought leadership at IRI and NPD, and even longer for prices to come down to what they were last year.\n\n“It may take some more time,” he said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/business/grocery-prices-august/index.html", "title": "Food prices are still soaring. Here's what's getting more expensive ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing, but food prices are still through the roof.\n\nFood costs spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAmericans browsing the supermarket aisle will notice most food items are far more expensive than they were a year ago. Egg prices soared 39.8%, while flour got 23.3% more expensive. Milk rose 17% and the price of bread jumped 16.2%.\n\nMeat and poultry also grew costlier. Chicken prices jumped 16.6%, while meats rose 6.7% and pork increased 6.8%. Fruits and vegetables together are up 9.4%.\n\nOverall, grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8%.\n\nEgg prices have soared over the past year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nWhy there’s no relief at the grocery store\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to tame inflation, but the central bank says that food prices are largely out of its control.\n\nThat’s because food prices are affected by global events, such as the war in Ukraine, which affects the costs of wheat and other commodities. Prices also reflect the impact of natural disasters like crop-killing droughts and diseases such as avian flu, which has constrained the supply of eggs and turkeys.\n\nPlus, it takes time for changes, such as decreases in ingredient prices, to funnel down to consumers. That means that relief from the surge grocery prices could lag declines in other areas.\n\nAnd demand for food isn’t flexible — consumers may be able to skimp on other items, such as clothing or gasoline, but they have to eat. Even so, shoppers are increasingly making changes to their diets and shopping habits to cope with rising costs.\n\nPeople are pulling back on certain items. Sales of frozen dinners and entrees have fallen about 11% by volume in August compared to the year prior, according to a report this week from IRI, a market research company. Cookie volumes and volumes of refrigerated juices fell nearly 9% and about 8%, respectively, in that period. Lower-income households in particular are skipping items like juice, snacks and candy.\n\nRecently, Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers, who may be trading down from more expensive restaurants. And Tyson (TSN) has noticed higher demand for chicken as shoppers buy fewer pricey steaks.\n\nWhat got more expensive\n\nThe seasonally adjusted prices of most grocery items ticked up from July to August, but there were some standouts.\n\nMargarine spiked the most, up 7.3%. Eggs were 2.9% more expensive and sugar was 2.4% higher, while flour and bread edged up 2.2%. Canned fruit prices rose 3.4% while fresh vegetables got 1.2% pricier.\n\nHot dog prices jumped 4.9%, while ham was up 1.3% and turkey rose 2.2%.\n\nSome meat prices fell, however. Bacon was .5% less expensive, while the price of pork roasts, steaks and ribs fell 1.9%.\n\nAnd some fruit prices moderated as well, with apples getting 2.3% cheaper and citrus fruits falling 1.6%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/06/15/fact-check-egg-prices-rising-nationwide/7566102001/", "title": "Fact check: Egg prices are rising nationwide", "text": "The claim: USDA is predicting egg prices will be $12 a dozen by fall 2022\n\nA highly contagious bird flu outbreak is reducing the U.S. chicken flock and driving up egg prices nationwide, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut not to the extent some social media users have suggested.\n\nA June 7 Facebook post claims the \"USDA is predicting egg prices will be $12 a dozen by Fall 2022.\"\n\nThe post accrued more than 100 shares in a week.

The agency does forecast wholesale egg prices, which are projected to be $1.70 per dozen in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAs of June 10 , the average price of a dozen Grade A large eggs in the U.S. was $2.86, according to Federal Reserve economic data.\n\nEgg prices have risen this year because of an inconsistent supply of eggs. For example, the overall inventory of shell eggs decreased by 4% and the national inventory of large eggs was down 7%, according to a June 10 USDA Egg Market Overview.\n\nPrices are rising on more than just eggs.

Fruits and vegetables got 9.3% more expensive.\n\nGrocery items are still going up. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the rise in food costs: A deadly avian flu has meant fewer eggs in the United States, a severe drought in Brazil slashed coffee crops and the war in Ukraine led to a spike in wheat prices in the spring.\n\nWhile commodity prices are falling, it will take time before those lower costs pass through to consumers. Plus, plenty of other costs for producers — such as fuel, labor and packaging — have also been high.\n\nAnd as supply has been disrupted, demand has grown.\n\nDemand for groceries grows\n\nUnlike discretionary items, consumers can’t simply stop buying food when prices rise. They may, however, opt for less expensive options. Producers, grocers and restaurant operators have noted that consumers are indeed trading down — swapping out higher-priced items for more affordable ones.\n\nEarlier this week, Tyson (TSN) said demand for steak is falling while interest in chicken is rising. Wendy’s (WEN) traffic has been hit because some customers are deciding to pack lunches or eat breakfast at home, CEO Todd Penegor said during a post-earnings analyst call Wednesday.\n\nPenegor added that about 82% of meals were eaten at home pre-pandemic, but that figure jumped three percentage points since then and has stayed there.\n\n“The consumer has been a little more strapped, so there’s a few more meals prepared at home,” Penegor said. “Inflation has been high, so net disposable income has been a little bit pinched.”\n\nRestaurants have also been raising prices, but at a slower clip: In the 12-month period through July, menu prices rose 7.6%, less than overall inflation.\n\nPlus, food prices are largely unaffected by current government efforts to curtail spiraling costs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged as much during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, saying that raising interest rates to fight inflation wouldn’t lower food prices.\n\nThe Fed believes that “food and energy are influenced by global commodity prices in a way that tells them, ‘Hey, these items aren’t really directly under your control,’” noted Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America Global Research.\n\nEssentially, the thinking is this: Because the US can’t control international factors such as the war in Ukraine and higher shipping costs, it can’t fully control domestic food prices.\n\nWhat’s more, the US government doesn’t have a stockpile of food as it does of oil, noted Rob Fox, director of the knowledge exchange division at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses.\n\n“There’s no ability for the government to release extra stalks of wheat and corn and cheese and so on,” Fox said.\n\nWhat got more expensive in June\n\nThe result has been steadily higher prices in the grocery aisle, with some items seeing larger month over month spikes than others.\n\nIn July, adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices popped 4.3% compared to June. Coffee and peanut butter each got 3.5% more expensive. Flour rose 3.2% and bread prices went up 2.8%. Cheese jumped 2%, while chicken got 1.4% pricier.\n\nThere was some relief, however.

The average price for a dozen large Grade A eggs in December hit $4.25, up from $1.79 the year before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWhy are eggs so expensive?\n\nThree reasons: an increase in holiday demand, higher production costs for farmers, and an outbreak of bird flu, a highly contagious virus that can be fatal to poultry such as chickens and turkeys.\n\nAs of December, more than 43 million egg-laying hens were lost since the outbreak began in February 2022, according to the to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe virus has led to the deaths of more than 57 million birds in hundreds of commercial and backyard flocks across 47 states since February, surpassing the 50 million birds lost in the 2015 avian influenza outbreak, according to the USDA.\n\n\"We have seen infections get into a flock, where they look perfectly fine one day, and then the next day they're all dead,\" said Gregory Martin, a poultry educator at Penn State Extension. \"That's how quick this thing moves.

This year's increase is double the price difference Datasembly calculated in 2021.\n\nHow can I save money on holiday shopping?\n\nInflation is still hitting U.S. consumers' wallets, but Wells Fargo's Swanson noted that there is some good news from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's latest consumer price index report.\n\n“There are some of those holiday favorites that are actually starting to show some pretty decent declines,” he said.\n\nFresh fish and seafood, beef, pork ribs and pork roasts are just some examples of grocery store items that saw price drops between October and November.\n\nHow to save money on holiday dinners:'You don't need to make a butter board'\n\nAldi 101: How to save on groceries, get $2.95 wine, knock-off Chick-fil-A and find rare deals without coupons\n\nFor shoppers looking to cut costs this holiday season, Swanson suggests taking the time to shop around for the best deals.\n\n“Give yourself time to shop two or three stores to see which ones really are offering you the best bargain, because one thing is very, very certain: It’s not uniform. It's not like there's a uniform price for anything out there in the market. If you shop around, you'd be surprised how wide the spread could be at certain items,” he said.\n\nOther tips reported by USA TODAY include:\n\nShopping store brands and discount grocers.\n\nBuying in bulk at Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale.\n\nUsing cash-back apps and rewards programs like Ibotta and Fetch Rewards.\n\nDig Deeper\n\nYou can follow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter @bailey_schulz and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2023/02/14/cpi-january-inflation-data-today-live-updates/11247836002/", "title": "CPI January 2023 is 6.4%, core inflation rose", "text": "Inflation eased for the seventh straight month in January, helped by lower costs for used vehicles and offering some relief to consumers struggling with high prices over the past year.\n\nConsumer price index data released on Tuesday showed that prices for a range of goods and services rose by 6.4% over the past 12 months, down slightly from an annual rate of 6.5% in December and a 40-year high of 9.1% in June.\n\nOn a month-by-month basis, however, prices increased by 0.5% in January compared with a slower gain of 0.1% in December. The acceleration was driven by shelter costs.\n\nAmericans have been struggling with soaring prices since last year, resulting in a decline in the real value of their income despite historic wage increases. High inflation has also amplified the risk of a recession.\n\nThe inflation data follows last month’s surprisingly strong labor report, which showed that employers added 517,000 jobs, well above expectations and raising concerns that the economy remains too hot and could keep prices at elevated levels for too long.\n\nThe latest index news \"underscores the challenges faced by the Fed,\" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. \"Inflation may have peaked, but it’s not showing signs of rapidly returning\" to the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nTo get there, the Fed will likely have to continue hiking rates higher and longer than many anticipated.\n\nInflated cost of housing:What that means for rent, mortgages\n\nCould inflation fall even faster? The Fed may not need to continue rate hikes, easing recession risk\n\nCore consumer price index\n\nCore consumer price index, a measure of inflation that strips away volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.4% for the second month in a row. That put the annual core index inflation rate at 5.6%.\n\nGregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said the rise in core consumer price index last month isn't \"cause for concern\" since the big jump in shelter prices could mean there will be smaller increases in coming months.\n\nDaco predicts annual inflation will fall to 2.3% by the end of the year. Core inflation, he predicts, will fall to 2.8% by then.\n\nHousing costs drove inflation higher\n\nRising shelter costs were the biggest contributor to rising inflation last month and year, accounting for half of the 0.5% monthly increase in prices and 60% of the 6.4% annual inflation rate, the Labor Department said. Shelter costs rose by 0.7% last month and are up 7.9% from a year ago.\n\n“Home prices rose much faster than incomes over the past three years,” said Bright MLS Chief Economist Lisa Sturtevant. “The Fed’s rate increases, which have led to higher mortgage rates, have made the cost of buying a home even more costly.”\n\nWhat’s different about the index in January?\n\nNew changes went into effect last month to adjust for shifting consumer spending patterns. By design, the index takes into account price increases for more than 200 categories as well as the portion of the typical Americans’ budget they take up.\n\nThis is done so that the overall index reflects the proportional price changes consumers experience. Without taking consumers’ budgets into account the 70% increase in the price for a carton of eggs from a year ago could disproportionately skew the overarching inflation data.\n\n'Egg-scuse me, this carton is how much?':Here's why egg prices are soaring across the US\n\nFed's next move:Powell says strong jobs report shows that more Fed rate hikes could be needed to lower inflation\n\nAhead of January’s index release the Bureau of Labor Statistics, published new weights for certain categories, a process it undergoes every two years. Moving forward, it will update the weights every year.\n\nWith the new changes, housing accounts for 44.4% of the index, up from 42.4%. That reflects an increase in weight for shelter to 34.4% from 33.3% and rent, also known as owners’ equivalent rent, which rose to 25.4% from 24.3%.\n\n“At the moment, OER is still running hot so a higher weight will likely keep some upward pressure on core CPI in the near term,” said Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid.\n\nMeanwhile, food weight fell to 13.5% from 13.9%.\n\nAdditionally, prior to Tuesday's release, the BLS published new annual calculations to correct price changes that correspond to seasonal demand. The changes resulted in revisions to previously reported index data.\n\nFor instance, the initial index report for December found that consumer prices declined by 0.1% from November. However, revised data released last week found that prices actually rose by 0.1% in December. It also found that prices rose by 0.2% in November versus the previously reported 0.1% increase.\n\nThe new weighting system combined with the new seasonal calculations played a role in the minimal deacceleration for prices over the past 12 months from December to January, said Raymond James' chief economist Eugenio Aleman.\n\nS&P 500\n\nStock indiceended mostly lower on Tuesday following the report's release. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 eased while the Nasdaq Composite rose slightly. The S&P 500, the broadcast gauge of stocks, finished down 1.2 points or 0.03%.\n\n10-year Treasury\n\nYields for 10-year Treasury notes climbed after the report was released. They're trading above 3.7%, near the highs for the month.\n\nWhat January’s inflation data means for the Fed\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve doesn’t reconvene for another month, Tuesday’s index report combined with the latest jobs report will likely lead the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points for the second time this year.\n\nThe report likely won’t give the Fed enough confidence that inflation will continue to ease on its own for it to stop raising interest rates, said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.\n\n\"Recent data have sent conflicting signals,\" he said, noting that the latest jobs report casts the economy in a positive light as opposed to recent layoffs announcements and consumer spending and industrial production data. \"The Fed will look at the balance of the signal from these data in deciding how much more to raise interest rates this year.\"\n\nPresident Biden reacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrated the inflation data saying it's \"good news for families and businesses across the country.\" He acknowledged that there's \"more work to do\" to get prices down and that there \"could be setbacks along the way.\"\n\nWhen is the next inflation report?\n\nThe Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index comes out on Feb. 24. The next consumer price index report is due on March 14.\n\nMedora Lee contributed to this report.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald is a personal finance and markets correspondent for USA TODAY.

And now the USDA revised its forecast upward for all food categories, including meats, poultry, eggs, dairy products, fats and oils, and more. The only category that the USDA revised downward was fresh vegetables.\n\nBeef and veal had the largest increase and fresh vegetables the smallest. Prices for wholesale beef are predicted to increase between 4% and 7%.\n\nContributing to the higher retail poultry and egg prices, the report said, is avian influenza. Prices for poultry are predicted to increase by 6% to 7% and 2.5%-3.5% for eggs.\n\n\"An ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza could contribute to poultry and egg price increases through reduced supply or decrease prices through lowered international demand for U.S. poultry products or eggs,\" according to the report.\n\nCoin shortage 2022:Why is there a coin shortage?

A few days earlier he said the agency deemed the state ineligible for the aid because it is \"most typically involved with disasters where there is tremendous home or property damage.\"\n\nFEMA will send a senior response official and an incident management team to East Palestine.\n\nFollowing the derailment, officials decided to do a controlled release of the vinyl chloride, allowing it to burn to prevent an explosion. The burn caused toxic fumes to be released into the area, which alarmed residents about possible long-term effects after the explosion.\n\nStill, authorities say testing of air and water has not detected anything of concern.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say rainbow-colored slicks seen on video in creeks near the site appear to be vinyl chloride. Authorities have confirmed about 3,500 small fish were killed in nearby creeks shortly after the incident, and a new federal lawsuit claims fish and wild animals are dying as far as 20 miles away from the site of the derailment.

Regan urged anyone experiencing symptoms to see a doctor and alert their local or state health departments.\n\nThe agency is helping the state test the water and air, collect soil samples, and screen homes. Also, the U.S. Department of Transportation is on-site investigating the derailment.\n\n\"This is going to be a long-term commitment,\" Brown said during his visit, echoing Regan's comments.

At a town hall Wednesday night, residents became angrier when Mayor Trent Conaway told them they wouldn't get an opportunity to question Norfolk Southern officials to learn more about the derailment after the rail company backed out.\n\nResidents voiced frustrations at a series of meetings this week over what they have said is incomplete and vague information about long-term effects of the incident.\n\n\"I have three grandbabies,\" said resident Kathy Dyke at a public meeting Wednesday. \"Are they going to grow up here in five years and have cancer?\"\n\nJames Wolfe, an East Palestine native who lives in neighboring Columbiana, Ohio, said he hopes the rail industry and local, state, and federal government learn from the derailment.\n\n\"It's going to happen again,\" Wolfe said. \"They're not going to do anything to stop it.\"\n\n'WE ARE HERE AND WILL STAY HERE':Norfolk Southern's CEO letter and plea to residents affected by Ohio train derailment\n\nWhat may have caused the derailment?\n\nOn Feb. 3, an eastbound Norfolk Southern Railway freight train, which contained hazardous materials, derailed on main track 1 in East Palestine, Ohio, about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and 21 miles south of Youngstown, Ohio.\n\nInvestigators examined the rail car that initiated the derailment and have surveillance video from a home showing “what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment,” the NTSB said Tuesday.

The event, formerly known as Holidays on the River, has moved to Government Plaza for this holiday season, The Tuscaloosa News reported. It’s now known as Holidays on the Plaza. Ice skating is scheduled to continue through Jan. 17. Along with outdoor ice skating, Holidays on the Plaza features the Tinsel Trail benefiting Tuscaloosa’s One Place, private parties, and other holiday festivities, organizers said. The decision to move the holiday ice skating from the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater was because of ongoing construction on Jack Warner Parkway, city officials said. “With increased visibility and proximity to local businesses and restaurants, we hope to make this event more convenient to the community,” said Stacy Vaughn, director of public services. Holidays on the River began nine years ago on the Mildred Westervelt Warner Transportation Museum property, the Tuscaloosa News reported. It grew in popularity, and moved in 2015 to the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater. Admission to Holidays on the Plaza is free. However, guests must purchase skate passes to access the ice rink.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: A federal grant will allow an extensive trail system to connect all four communities on Nelson Island, just off Alaska’s western coast. The $12\n\nmillion grant will pay to take the trail the last link, from Toksook Bay, which received the federal money, to the community of Mertarvik, the new site for the village of Newtok. The village is moving because of erosion. However, Newtok has not yet agreed to accept the trail. Newtok Tribal Administrator Phillip Carl told KYUK the village council has not met in months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the council is scheduled to meet in December, and will vote on the trail project. Even if they decide not to accept the project, Toksook Bay still intends to build most of the trail to Mertarvik. However, they would stop just short of the village, at the border between the two village corporations. Work on the trail to Mertarvik still needs to be designed and go through environmental reviews. If approved, construction is expected to start in 2023 and take about two years to complete. The island’s trail system will span 50 miles, connecting the four communities: Toksook Bay, Tununak, Nightmute and Mertarvik. The trail connecting Toksook Bay to Nightmute is expected to be completed next summer.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two hikers were rescued Saturday in separate operations at Echo Canyon and South Mountain. According to the Phoenix Fire Department, the rescues involved a 59-year-old man who experienced chest pains while hiking Echo Canyon and a 14-year-old boy who tripped and suffered a lower-extremity injury while hiking Holbert Trailhead at South Mountain. Firefighters arrived at Holbert Trailhead just before 11 a.m. Saturday and hiked approximately 1\n\nmile to the location where a 14-year-old boy tripped and fell while hiking. After locating him, emergency personnel conducted basic life-support measures and splinted the patient’s leg. He was extricated by helicopter from the scene. The Phoenix Fire Department said the patient was then taken to a local pediatric emergency room for further evaluation. The other hiker was assisted by Technical Rescue Teams in Echo Canyon. After a quick assessment, rescue teams decided to use the “Big Wheel” to help the hiker off of the mountain after he stated he didn’t feel comfortable walking down on his own, according to the Phoenix Fire Department. Once at the trailhead, a second assessment of the hiker was performed and rescue crews determined the patient needed transport to a local hospital. Phoenix Fire Department said no emergency personnel was injured in either incident.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: The U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $20\n\nmillion grant to finish the final section of a bike and pedestrian trail in southeastern Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism was awarded the money to construct the final 13.4-mile section of the Delta Heritage Trail. Once complete, the 87-mile trail stretching from Lexa to Arkansas City will be one of the longest dedicated pedestrian and bicycle trails in Arkansas. The federal grant is being matched by $20\n\nmillion from the Walton Family Foundation. State parks officials said the project is expected to be finished by 2025.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A federal appeals court temporarily blocked an order that all California prison workers must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or have a religious or medical exemption. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request for a stay of September’s lower court order pending an appeal. It also sped up the hearing process by setting a Dec. 13 deadline for opening briefs. The vaccination mandate was supposed to have taken effect by Jan. 12 but the appellate court stay blocks enforcement until sometime in March, when the appeal hearing will be scheduled. The judge who issued the vaccination mandate followed the recommendation of a court-appointed receiver who was chosen to manage the state prison health care system after a federal judge in 2005 found that California failed to provide adequate medical care to prisoners. In addition to requiring COVID-19 shots for prison workers, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar required vaccinations or exemptions for inmates who want in-person visits or who work outside prisons, including inmate firefighters.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The remains of the final victim of the Black Hollow Flood have been discovered four months after she and her three family members were swept away in the flood. About 4 p.m. Nov. 20, a local resident reported finding what she thought to be human remains while hiking east of Rustic Road – a little more than 4 miles east of Black Hollow Road – according to a news release from the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies with the sheriff’s office and investigators with Larimer County Coroner’s Office recovered those remains, and the coroner’s office identified them as belonging to 57-year-old Diana Brown of San Antonio. Brown was swept away by the flood waters July 20 along with her family members Richard Brown of Bellevue, Nebraska; Patricia Brown of Madison, Wisconsin; and David Brown of San Antonio. Their bodies were recovered in a section of the river between Arrowhead Lodge and the Indian Meadows area of the Poudre Canyon several days after the flood. Richard Brown owned a mobile home on Black Hollow Road, according to Larimer County property records, but his home residence was in Bellevue. All four victims were in the same house in the small Black Hollow area 45\n\nmiles west of Fort Collins when the Black Hollow Creek initiated a flash flood down the mountainside filled with large boulders and trees burned in the Cameron Peak Fire.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The Torrington Public Schools district is turning to a limousine service company to help transport students to school because of a bus driver shortage that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. The district plans to use some of its $5.9\n\nmillion in federal coronavirus relief funds to pay Carriage & Limousine Services of Oxford to help cover its 53 bus routes. The private company has said it can provide 30 passenger buses and 10 passenger vans to cover morning bus runs on an emergency basis and afternoon runs more regularly, the Waterbury Republican-American reported. The company charges $125 an hour for passenger buses and $87.50 an hour for passenger vans. All-Star Transportation, the city’s main bus provider, has had difficulty finding enough drivers, which has caused morning delays and prevented most after-school programs, the superintendent of schools, Susan Lubomski, recently told the Board of Education.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware’s K-12 public schools are continuing to report fewer than 300 COVID-19 cases that are deemed as being in-person and contagious. The Delaware State News reported last week the numbers remained below 300 for the fifth consecutive week. The data was released Wednesday by the Delaware Division of Public Health. The agency said there were 298 cases for students, just 0.21% of the estimated 141,040 public school students. The week’s numbers were slightly up from 0.17% – or 243 cases – from the previous week. Delaware has recorded a total of 3,397 in-person contagious cases among students this school year. That figure amounts to 2.4% of all public school students. Another 665 cases have been reported among staff. The data is for all of Delaware’s public schools. That includes 19 districts and 23 charter schools that are part of the public school system.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Knights of Columbus handed out new winter coats for those in need at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in southeast D.C. on Friday, WUSA-TV reported. Many low-income families have scarce resources to cover even the most basic essentials, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Knights of Columbus launched the Coats for Kids program to ensure that every child in North America would have access to a warm winter coat. Since the program started in D.C. in 2009, councils have purchased and distributed more than 500,000 new winter coats to children throughout North America. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, who is the first Black U.S. prelate to earn the coveted red cap, said this is the season for giving if you can. “It’s a great gesture of concern for kids and young people who need a little help at this time of year,” Gregory said. Metro Police officers were also picking up coats. Each district gets three boxes. Officer Karen Voglezon said giving them out is a way to connect with the community they serve. “We never know what anybody’s situation is, so to get a warm coat for the winter is very good,” Officer Voglezon said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Federal authorities have taken into custody a 26-year-old man who apparently stowed away in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines fight that arrived at Miami International Airport from Guatemala on Saturday morning. The man was in the wheel well area when the flight arrived from Guatemala City at 10:06 a.m., officials said. News outlets reported that Flight 1182 was met by law enforcement because of a security issue. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers took the man into custody, the agency said in a news release. Medics took the man to a hospital for a medical assessment. “Persons are taking extreme risks when they try to conceal themselves in confined spaces such as an aircraft,” the agency said. The news release didn’t say whether the man will face any charges, or what will happen to him when he’s released from the hospital.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLawrenceville: All active school district employees in Gwinnett County eligible for benefits are in line to get $1,000 in bonuses next month, as well as a paid Juneteenth holiday next year. Superintendent Calvin Watts recommended the bonuses to the county’s Board of Education, which approved them unanimously, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The bonus will be paid in a lump sum in the December monthly paycheck for about 21,500 employees, including teachers, administrators and support personnel, according to a news release from Gwinnett County Public Schools. The one-time bonuses’ $21.5\n\nmillion cost will not tie up future budgets or decrease the year-end fund balance, the news release said. Atlanta Public Schools is also considering $1,000 stipends next month for all its 6,000 workers, including part-time employees.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distributor in Hawaii has filed a federal lawsuit against a dairy company because milk from the mainland is allegedly being sold under a name that advertises local ties. The lawsuit filed by Hawaii Foodservice Alliance claims Meadow Gold Dairies is selling milk from California alongside advertising that reads, “Hawaii’s Dairy” and “Made with Aloha,” the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The lawsuit said the company has no cows in Hawaii and their “Lani Moo” mascot is misleading. Meadow Gold has long sold milk produced in Hawaii. The company was sold in April 2020 to Bahman Sadeghi, a Big Island dairy farmer, who allegedly began using milk from outside the state. “We have never claimed that all our milk is local, but we do consider ourselves Hawaii’s Dairy because we are committed to Hawaii and its community and will continue to be while we work toward building a more sustainable operation,” Meadow Gold said in a statement. In a similar but unrelated case, a federal judge recently tossed out a lawsuit against California-based King’s Hawaiian, which produces sweet rolls. Hawaii Public Radio reported King’s Hawaiian was sued because their label features the words “Established 1950” and “Hilo, Hawaii” in reference to the company’s founding. U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton said the packaging clearly states the rolls are made in California and a geographic reference such as Hilo would not deceive a consumer into believing the product was made there.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise The city is looking to expand its geothermal heating system by 40% as part of a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050. The city pumps 250 gallons of geothermal water to 96 buildings through 21 miles of pipes. The water has a temperature of 177 degrees Fahrenheit. City officials said that the geothermal heat supplies about 2% of the city’s energy resources. “Geothermal really provides that clean energy alternative,” said Climate Action Manager Steve Hubble, the Idaho Statesman reported. The heated water comes from a river of geothermally heated water flowing under the nearby foothills. Experts said the water is heated by the Idaho Batholith, a massive igneous intrusion of granite producing heat through decay of isotopes like uranium, thorium, and potassium. Boise Geothermal Program Manager Jon Gunnerson said a large fault line runs through the Boise foothills and helps bring the water near the surface. The hot water is pumped from city-owned wells in the foothills to buildings, and then returned to the aquifer. City officials said they want to expand the use of the geothermal water by 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a year until reaching 355\n\nmillion gallons. Gunnerson said anyone interested in switching to geothermal should contact his office. The city says the rate is competitive with natural gas prices.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Capitol dome in Springfield will be without holiday lights for the third straight year. The same structural issue that kept workers from hanging about 1,300 lights from the state Capitol dome in 2019 and again last year has not been resolved, Secretary of State spokesman Henry Haupt told The Springfield State-Journal Register. Haupt said an engineering firm conducted an inspection of the dome in 2019 and recommended an observation deck above the dome be fortified before the lights are put up. “It’s the engineering firm just feels the Christmas lights shouldn’t be tethered to it until it’s fortified,” he said, adding that there is nothing wrong with the observation deck necessarily. He said the next step is for the secretary of state’s office – which is the custodian of the building – to work with the Capitol Development Boar to come up with the funding for the project. That means the lights, which were first hung on the dome in 1924 and became an annual tradition in the 1960s, will remain dark for at least one more holiday season.\n\nIndiana\n\nWinamac: Staff at a primate sanctuary in northern Indiana will be feeding the center’s menagerie with freshly picked fruit in the coming years because of a newly planted orchard. A team of volunteers helped plant 60 fruit trees last month on the property of the Peaceable Primate Sanctuary, which is home to baboons and macaque monkeys retired from research facilities and pharmaceutical companies. The new orchard at the primate center is outfitted with an irrigation system and within a few years it will supply the sanctuary with fresh apples, persimmons and other fruits, WSBT-TV reported. The orchard was planted after donations and a partnership with an organization called The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation. The next project at the sanctuary, located in Winamac, about 40 miles southwest of South Bend, is to build space for 10 additional primates that will be retiring there, said Scott Kubisch, the center’s director and founder.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines Iowa motorists will soon have the option of keeping their driver’s license on their phones. State officials have begun a pilot project to make digital driver’s licenses, or “mobile IDs,” available for download via smartphone apps sometime in 2022, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported Friday. Iowa is one of several states that have considered, tested or begun issuing digital versions of driver’s licenses. Iowa plans to test devices equipped with digital versions through December, with about 100 state Department of Transportation employees expected to enlist by spring as a test group to make sure the app works. Melissa Gillett, director of the department’s motor vehicle division, said the mobile ID will be optional, but motorists will still be expected to carry hard-copy licenses. Iowa DOT officials are working with technology vendors to address security and privacy concerns inherit with any electronic-based app. They also are working with law enforcement agencies, and want to make sure the digital ID can be accepted by retailers and other places that require people to show identification or proof of age or address.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Kansas utility regulators have issued an order requiring Evergy to explain and justify a plan to spend $10.4 billion on its electrical system and report quality of service measures on a quarterly basis amid concerns that the plan is designed largely to benefit a hedge fund investor. The Wichita Eagle reported members of the Kansas Corporation Commission sent a strong signal Tuesday that they won’t tolerate efforts to increase shareholder profits at the expense of unreasonably high rates for Evergy’s 1\n\nmillion Kansas customers. In a written statement, Evergy said it was reviewing the commission’s order before identifying “if there are appropriate next steps.” At issue is a plan undertaken by Evergy after Elliott Management Corp. bought into Evergy last year with a stated goal of raising the company’s profitability and stock prices.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky officials spent nearly $1 million to replace office furniture for hundreds of legislative staffers who work out of the state Capitol and Capitol Annex in Frankfort. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that Mike Wynn, spokesperson for the General Assembly’s Legislative Research Commission, said the purchase was necessary. “In short, we’ve reached a tipping point,” Wynn said. “Our furniture is more than a decade old, and many items have suffered significant wear over the years. It’s now cheaper to replace those items than repair them.” Fifty executive desks were bought for nearly $1,350 each. Meanwhile, more than 290 bookcases were bought for $815 each and 276 guest chairs were $339 each. No new furniture was purchased for lawmakers and their staffers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A New Orleans museum plans to launch an elaborate nighttime sound-and-light show next year to showcase individual stories of bravery and sacrifice during World War II. The National WII Museum plans to premier its Expressions of America show on Veterans Day in 2022. It will use music, art installations and projections of what the museum calls “living murals” on the various facades of the expansive museum in downtown New Orleans. The plan is to draw from the museum’s archives to tell personal stories of soldiers, nurses and chaplains who served, their loved ones and others who played a role on the home front, including factory workers, artists and entertainers. The show also will feature actor and veterans advocate Gary Sinise. Expressions of America is being produced at an estimated cost of about $5\n\nmillion, according to museum spokesman Keith Darcey. It will be sponsored by the Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation, a charitable organization founded in the name of the late comedian who famously entertained troops overseas, and his wife.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: A proposed salmon farm located at the site of the former Verso paper mill in Bucksport has not started construction despite receiving the necessary permits two years ago. A spokesperson for the company, Whole Oceans – which proposed the land-based aquaculture facility located on 100 acres along the Penobscot River – could not provide an update on when construction would start, the Bangor Daily News reported. The project received permits from the Bucksport Planning Board and approval from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection in 2019. In 2020, the company bought a second plot of land at the old mill site that it said meant it needed to review its plans. Bucksport Code Enforcement Officer Luke Chiavelli told the newspaper he had not received any applications related to construction on the second plot. The current approvals are valid for five years. The company is in compliance with permits and has paid its taxes, Susan Lessard, the Bucksport town manager, told the newspaper. She said the company told her they were in the process of hiring a CEO and there have been multiple previous changes in the company’s leadership in the past three years, the newspaper reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nEaston: Officials on Maryland’s Eastern Shore have voted to award a contract to remove a Confederate monument from a courthouse lawn and relocate it. The Talbot County Council voted unanimously to award a contract for the removal of the “Talbot Boys” statue and its relocation to a Virginia battlefield, news outlets reported. The council also passed an amendment that would allow submissions of alternative local sites for the monument until Dec. 6. The statue dedicated in 1916 commemorates more than 80 soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. It’s thought to be the last Confederate monument still standing on public property in Maryland besides cemeteries and battlefields. The contract was awarded to Washington, D.C.-based contractor Stratified for $67,000, an amount contingent on the project being funded by the Mid-Shore Community Foundation. No county funds are required for the bid.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A man has pleaded guilty to his role in a conspiracy to transport drugs and cash using secret compartments inside tractor trailers. Jamil Roman, 44, of Chicopee was indicted in 2016. He pleaded guilty on Tuesday in federal court in Springfield to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. He is scheduled to be sentenced in March. In 2014, Roman, who owned an auto body shop, and a co-defendant, Javier Gonzalez, conspired to distribute cocaine in western Massachusetts, prosecutors said. Roman admitted to meeting with Gonzalez and conspiring to collect a debt owed for the cocaine, which was part of a larger load obtained from a Mexican supply source. Law enforcement officers seized about $1.17\n\nmillion in cash from a hidden compartment inside a tractor trailer being driven by Gonzalez to Texas as payment for the drugs, prosecutors said. Gonzalez was sentenced in October to 21/2 years in prison and fined $20,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: In the wake of the death of a Michigan State University student two weekends ago, the school and the Pi Alpha Phi national organization have suspended the school’s chapter of the fraternity. The student, identified as Phat Nguyen, died early Nov. 20 at a residence off campus. An autopsy was conducted but the Office of the Medical Examiner at Sparrow Hospital said the cause of death would not be determined until toxicology results are completed in six to eight weeks. Authorities have said alcohol consumption might have been a factor and shortly after the incident, the East Lansing Police Department said its officers had responded to the scene where four people were “passed out,” including one who was not breathing. According to the Lansing State Journal, Nguyen’s death came a day after the fraternity posted on its Facebook page that he was one of four students who had just joined the chapter.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit the Twin Cities suburb of Rosemount on Tuesday to tout his $1 trillion infrastructure plan. The president has been making multiple stops across the country to highlight the infrastructure package. The White House has projected the package will deliver $4.5\n\nbillion to Minnesota for highways, $800\n\nmillion for public transportation and about $300\n\nmillion for bridge work over a five-year span, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The state also is in line for $680\n\nmillion for water projects, at least $100\n\nmillion for broadband expansion and about $297\n\nmillion for airport infrastructure. Biden won Minnesota by about 7 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: Mississippi is unveiling a new app that’s designed to store someone’s driver license on their phone. The app is being billed as a safe and effective way to make sure your ID is always on you, WLOX-TV reported. However, state officials said people will still need a physical driver license to show if requested when they are stopped by law enforcement. Another exception listed on the program’s website is boarding an airplane. Still, there’s a “growing list” of businesses and state agencies that accept the Mississippi Mobile ID, state officials said. “Vendors can accept the Mobile ID with confidence, as information on the digital ID can be verified against what is on file with the Department of Public Safety and will always be accurate and up-to-date,” the program’s website stated. Residents’ information is secure and can only be accessed with their fingerprint or face ID, officials with the Department of Public Safety said. Mississippi Mobile ID is voluntary, and residents may continue relying on their physical ID. More information about the program is available at www.driverservicebureau.dps.ms.gov/mobile-id/\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city’s embattled police chief’s last day on the job will be in April, a draft agreement obtained by The Kansas City Star showed. The letter was written after Chief Rick Smith met last week with Mayor Quinton Lucas and Board of Police Commissioners president, Mark Tolbert. The meeting came just four days after a Jackson County found Det. Eric DeValkenaere guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2019 shooting death of Cameron Lamb. Capt. Leslie Foreman, a spokeswoman for the department said in a statement Smith would retire sometime in 2022. She said Smith made a commitment to stay in the position no more than five years when he was hired in August 2017. But the new letter, which is addressed to Smith from Tolbert, provided more details. It said Smith will announce his retirement to the public on March 1, that his last day will be April 22 and that he will be compensated at his current salary through Aug. 31. Smith earns about $191,000 per year as chief. There have been repeated calls for Smith to resign, including during last year’s racial justice protests. Smith’s departure is expected to come up when the police board meets Monday in a closed session.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The value of livestock killed by predators such as grizzly bears and wolves is expected to exceed the budget for compensating ranchers for such losses this year, the Montana Livestock Loss Board said. George Edwards, the board’s executive director, said 331 head of livestock have been killed this year by wolves, grizzlies and mountain lions. With more than $262,000 in payouts having been made through Nov. 23, Edwards told The Billings Gazette he doesn’t think the state’s $300,000 annual budget will be enough to cover all the losses. Claims for animals killed by grizzly bears have been increasing in recent years. Six years ago, reported grizzly bear kills of cattle was 50 head, with another 16 probable kills. So far this year, there have been 80 confirmed kills and another 35 that are probable. Wolves also kill sheep, and mountain lions kill sheep and goats. The Montana Legislature started the Livestock Loss Program in 2007 to compensate ranchers for animals lost to grizzly bears and wolves. Mountain lions were added to the predators list and the legislature increased the compensation program’s annual budget from $200,000 to $300,000 in 2019.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln could be required to log into an online class or watch a recorded lecture from home when bad weather strikes. The Lincoln Journal Star reported a new policy gives UNL the option to require students to follow “instructional continuity plans.” The new policy goes into effect Jan. 3, the start of winter interim classes at UNL. The change comes after heavy snow earlier this year forced UNL to call off classes during an already compressed spring semester schedule. Faculty leaders and others asked for the option, and a plan was developed by the Faculty Senate, Association of Students of the University of Nebraska, and campus administrators. Instructors can choose how they want classes to continue in the event of inclement weather, while adhering to the same schedule and ensuring to make the option available for all students.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Residents of a rural, Republican-leaning town that the Nevada Legislature split into two Assembly districts filed a lawsuit last week challenging the state’s district maps. John Koenig and Gregory Hafen II, a Republican who represents Pahrump in the Statehouse, argued that the maps passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Steve Sisolak are drawn in a way that denies voters their right to elect representatives of their choice. The maps split rural Nye County into three state Assembly districts and Pahrump – its largest city – into two. The lawsuit filed in Carson City court said that combining Nye County voters into a district with more urban communities in the Las Vegas area dilutes their voting power and makes it unlikely that they’ll be able to choose a representative committed to their interests. A representative from a distant county, they said in the lawsuit, “will have little understanding of Pahrump’s and Nye County’s unique and local problems and issues and as such will be unable to adequately represent the needs and interests of Pahrump’s and Nye County’s rural voters.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKittery: The final submarine in the Navy’s Los Angeles class arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard last week for scheduled system upgrades and maintenance work. With more than 140 crew members aboard, the USS Cheyenne docked at the shipyard. Its home base is in Groton, Connecticut, from where it traveled. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard announced the Cheyenne is the third naval ship to be named after the Wyoming city, as well as the first of its class to partake in the Navy’s service-life extension program. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard spokesperson Gary Hildreth said the maintenance of the submarine is expected to last 30 months at a cost of approximately $315\n\nmillion. At 360 feet long and with a dead weight of 927 tons, the USS Cheyenne is capable of supporting military missions that include “anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface ship warfare, strike warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance,” according to the shipyard’s statement. The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company was awarded the contract to build the submarine in the fall of 1989, leading to its construction beginning July 6, 1992. The USS Cheyenne was commissioned Sept. 13, 1996.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: One of the Jersey Shore’s most popular boardwalks is undergoing repairs designed to better prepare it for next year’s summer crowds. Wildwood has begun repairing several blocks of its wooden walkway, as famous for the motorized tram cars that carry people up and down it as for the gigantic expanses of sand that stretch to the ocean. The first $4\n\nmillion of what could be a $30\n\nmillion to $40\n\nmillion project is being done solely with state funds included in this year’s budget. The walkway is particularly popular with tourists from Philadelphia and its suburbs. Engineers examined the concrete substructure of the walkway and determined that not all of it was in bad shape. An examination of the boardwalk’s underbelly by local and state officials in 2019 found some spots where concrete crumbled to the touch. But the overall assessment of the substructure cleared the way for less expensive plans to repair the sections most in need of work, Mayor Pete Byron said. Work started last week on a three-block section. Eventually, 20 of the boardwalk’s 26 blocks will be refurbished, a process that could take five years, with work done in the offseason to avoid interfering with tourist season.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Several members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation are urging the U.S. Forest Service to again allow a decades-old foot race that goes through a wilderness area and up into mountains overlooking Albuquerque. A letter by Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan and Rep. Melanie Stansbury asked the agency to reverse its 2020 decision that the La Luz Trail Race wouldn’t be permitted under the Cibola National Forest’s draft land and resource management plan. The lawmakers wrote that the 9-mile event held annually for more than 55 years “is a point of pride for New Mexicans and an important source of recreation and tourism.” The race, which attracted hundreds of runners, started in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains on the outskirts of Albuquerque and finished at Sandia Crest after an elevation gain of more than 4,000 feet. In a 2020 announcement, Sandia District Ranger Crystal Powell said officials had determined that the race should not have been permitted in the wilderness area because it was a commercial event.\n\nNew York\n\nPoughkeepsie: A second gun buyback event through the state Attorney General’s Office in less than six months is scheduled in the city for Dec. 4. Letitia James’ office is holding the event, in association with the city police department, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Beulah Baptist Church at 92 Catharine St. The amount residents can receive depends on the gun they bring, with the range beginning at $25 for a nonworking or antique gun, followed by $75 for a rifle or shotgun, $150 for a handgun and $250 for an assault rifle. Participants will receive a prepaid gift card at the church. Participants can trade in as many guns as they wish. Weapons must be unloaded and transported inside a plastic bag, paper bag or box. Licensed gun dealers and active or retired law enforcement officers are not allowed to participate in the program. Identification is not required to take part, and no questions will be asked. The Poughkeepsie City School District was forced to close its high school for several days after a shooting on Forbus Street roughly a half-hour after dismissal Nov. 15. City police said 40 to 50 people were in the area of the shooting. No injuries were reported. A 13-year-old found by police that day is in a juvenile facility, charged with criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nConcord: A fire has destroyed 60 guitars and up to 100 paintings at the North Carolina home of Jim Avett. He is the father of Scott and Seth Avett of the Avett Brothers band. The Charlotte Observer reported the fire occurred Friday in the city of Concord. “The fire started from a golf cart,” Jim Avett posted on Facebook. “Half the house is totally beyond repair.” Officials said that arriving firefighters saw “heavy fire from the garage” and entered the house to keep the flames from spreading. No one was injured, although Jim Avett said a cat was missing. The Avett Brothers, a three-time Grammy Award nominee, are based in North Carolina and have a national following. Jim Avett said on Facebook the blaze is “not a knockout punch.” “We have the strength, attitude, faith and abilities to move forward,” he wrote. “And we will!”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An agency key to implementing new in-state investment components of North Dakota’s $8.3 billion oil tax savings has a new leader. The State Investment Board recently named Retirement and Investment Office interim Executive Director Jan Murtha to take over the role on a permanent basis, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The office oversees about $20\n\nbillion of assets. Murtha, who is an attorney, has led the agency in the interim role since June, when Dave Hunter resigned for a job in Alabama. Murtha was hired in 2020 and previously was the office’s deputy executive director and chief retirement officer. The agency is key to effecting new in-state investment mandates of the Legacy Fund approved by the Legislature, which include making investments in companies in the state. During the Legislature’s special session earlier this month, state lawmakers approved an additional six full-time employees and $1.8\n\nmillion for salaries and expenses. Murtha has said those resources will help the office meet the new investment requirements.\n\nOhio\n\nLima: The city is about to swear in Democrat Sharetta Smith as its first female and first Black mayor. Smith will take her oath of office Monday at the city’s Veterans Memorial Civic and Convention Center. She defeated Republican Elizabeth Hardesty on Nov. 2 after the two topped a four-way primary in May.Smith succeeds retiring eight-term Mayor David Berger, who has led the city since 1989. She most recently served as his chief of staff. An attorney, Smith previously served as an assistant public defender and criminal court magistrate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEnid: The dedication for the world’s tallest fresh-cut Christmas tree, a 140-foot Douglas fir, took place Friday night during the opening ceremony for “The One,” a 42-day Christmas event at 150 W Park Ave. In recent days, a special crew from California used boom lift aerial equipment to decorate the tree with more than 20,000 LED lights. Crew members also braved the Oklahoma winds to add about 10,000 ornaments for a show-stopping effect. And an Enid florist shop owner and local volunteers decorated numerous smaller trees that formed a brightly colored ring around the tree. Kyle Williams, chief executive officer of Hammer Williams Co,. said he and his wife Carol came up with the idea for “The One” extravaganza with their four grown children. They envisioned a series of concerts, plays and other activities to take place around a huge tree in downtown Enid. About two years ago, the Williams family did some research to determine where the tallest fresh-cut Christmas trees were featured in previous years. Williams said he found that the giant trees were often the highlight of elaborate holiday scenes created at outlet malls and casinos across the country. And then there was the large fresh-cut Christmas tree famously featured each year at New York City’s Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians will soon have more options for camping – especially those looking for a quick trip – as the state parks department works to complete details on a capital improvement plan. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported staff in the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department recently outlined some of the plans at a Parks and Recreation Commission meeting. Park Services Manager Matt Rippee said expanded campgrounds are in the works for several state parks in the Willamette Valley, including Silver Falls and Champoeg. “It also gives folks an opportunity, if a big storm comes through in the middle of the night, or a baby is crying, they can hop in the car and head home, and it’s not a four hour drive,” he said. The expansion is part of an approved $50 million, by state lawmakers, to fund a series of projects over the next five years. In addition, as part of the package the iconic Smith Rock State Park is set to receive $4 million to $6 million for upgrades throughout the park – including added parking, extended hiking trails and a visitor center.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its percentage of vaccinated adults in Pennsylvania by nearly 5 percentage points in what apparently was a data correction to weed out duplicates. The agency adjusted the percentage to 68.9%, after a day earlier putting the percentage at 73.7% of Pennsylvanians 18 and older. The downward revision amounted to a reduction of about 1.2\n\nmillion doses. Pennsylvania’s Department of Health said it sends its data to the CDC, and began in July to refine its data to remove duplicate information and correct data on first, second and booster doses. The data correction came as infections, hospitalizations and intensive-care unit cases are rising in Pennsylvania and many other states. The department said there are 3,349 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, up about 21% in November. That includes 763 in the ICU, up about 17% in November. More than 33,000 people in Pennsylvania have died from COVID-19, according to Department of Health data.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee said the annual holiday celebration and tree lighting at the State House will take place at 5 p.m. on Thursday on the south lawn. The tree will be lit at 6:15 p.m. Two Christmas trees will be on display at the State House. A 12-foot Douglas fir from Henry’s Christmas Tree Farm in Scituate will be outside the State House and an 18-foot artificial tree will be inside the State House. The Douglas fir was purchased with donations from several local businesses and the artificial tree was purchased with funds from the 2017 National Governors Association conference, McKee said. Keeping a real tree alive inside the State House has proved challenging. In 2005, the tree turned brown and shed all its needles. In 2017 the tree died 10 days before Christmas. The governor’s office purchased an artificial tree in 2019. After the tree is lit, McKee and first lady Susan McKee will read “The Night Before Christmas.” The celebration features performances by Billy Gilman, the Cumberland Clef Singers, the Paul Cuffee Lower School Chorus and the Rhode Island Army National Guard’s “Governor’s Own” 88th Army Band. Unwrapped toys will be collected to benefit local children in need. Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus are also scheduled to appear to take socially-distanced photos with children.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: More loggerhead turtle nests were counted on South Carolina beaches this year than in 2020, according to state Department of Natural Resources data. The Post and Courier of Charleston reported officials counted more than 5,600 sea turtle nests this year, with data still being compiled. The final 2020 count was 5,560. That remains below the state’s two biggest years, with 6,446 in 2016 and 8,774 in 2019. The state’s first nest was reported on May 5 on Seabrook Island. The town of Kiawah Island said its last nest was counted Oct. 10. In July, volunteers found a rare two-headed sea turtle hatchling while conducting an inventory at Edisto Beach. As far as the park specialists know, this was a first for the beach. The turtle was released into the Atlantic Ocean. Loggerheads are the Palmetto State’s primary nesting sea turtles. But the department this year reported a Kemp’s ridley nest and five green sea turtle nests. Last year, 16% of nests were washed away, including some by Hurricane Isaias, said state DNR state sea turtle coordinator Michelle Pate. This year, 3.4% of eggs were lost. Pate said a larger share of lost eggs were eaten by predators this year, including coyotes, foxes and raccoons.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The addition of sports betting helped drive a 20% revenue increase for Deadwood casinos in October, according to new state data. The Rapid City Journal reported that a report from the South Dakota Commission on Gaming showed the casinos generated 20.54% more revenue last month than in October 2020. Gamblers shelled out more than $116\n\nmillion for slots, $8.3\n\nmillion for table game bets and $815,036 in sports bets. Sports betting became legal in South Dakota in July. Betting began in early September after the gaming commission approved a list of sporting events that gamblers can wager on, including the Olympics, professional and college sports. Five Deadwood casinos offered sports betting in October, paying out just over $98,000. Most bets were placed on professional and college football. Overall, gamblers spent almost $1.3\n\nbillion in Deadwood casinos through the first 10 months of the year. That’s up nearly 40% from 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced casinos to close temporarily. Slot machines paid out more than $10.8\n\nmillion in winnings and table games yielded almost $1.5\n\nmillion in winnings, mostly from blackjack and house-banked poker, according to the report.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A woman attacked two flight attendants on a Spirit Airlines flight to Nashville on Saturday night, was restrained by a fellow passenger, and then yelled at police officers to “shoot me” when they arrested her. Airport police arrested a 42-year old female for public intoxication after the flight crew contacted officers on the ground at Nashville International Airport about 7 p.m., an arrest affidavit said. The flight took off from Fort Lauderdale at about 6 p.m., according to Spirit Airlines spokesperson Nicole Aguiar and FlightAware, a flight tracking website. When the plane arrived, members of the crew told officers that she attacked two flight attendants, punching one and pulling the other’s hair. Aguiar did not comment on details in the affidavit but said law enforcement officers removed “a passenger for unruly behavior.” When the passenger deplaned, another passenger was restraining her feet with zip ties, the affidavit said. She smelled of alcohol, spoke in a slurred manner, and her eyes were bloodshot. She told officers she drank “a lot,” the affidavit said. After police arrested her, she yelled at the officers on several occasions, using expletives and saying “I didn’t do anything wrong” and “shoot me,” according to the affidavit. The passenger also resisted getting into the police cruiser, including by stiffening her legs to prevent officers from closing the door. Davidson County Sheriff’s Office jail logs showed she was admitted into jail on at 8:40 p.m. Saturday, but she was released 6 a.m., Sunday.\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: An invasive underwater weed is spreading in a central Texas lake popular with anglers, tangling boat propellers and threatening fish. The weed is hydrilla, an aquatic plant initially imported and sold as an aquarium plant in the 1950s that has become one of the world’s most invasive plants. Fishing guide Bob Maindelle said its presence is at a record level in Stillhouse Hollow Lake, about 13 miles southeast of Killeen. “So much hydrilla has now grown in Stillhouse that entire coves are now completely inaccessible to boating anglers because the matted vegetation entangles the propellers of both outboard engines and electric trolling motors, thus prohibiting access,” Maindelle wrote recently in the Killeen Daily Herald. The plants are spread by uncleaned boats and form thick mats on water surfaces, changing their pH levels, stripping them of oxygen, restricting native plant growth, blocking nutrients for aquatic animals, and hindering irrigation, recreation and water flow, according to the Texas Invasive Species Institute. It also can damage water quality and foster the growth of toxic blue-green algae. Such algae were linked to the recent sudden deaths of multiple dogs at nearby Belton Lake.\n\nUtah\n\nPanguitch: A minor earthquake struck parts of southern Utah on Friday morning. The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 3.0 and was centered about 7 miles west of Panguitch, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It happened at about 6:40 a.m. Quakes of that magnitude are among the smallest generally felt by people.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A final total of the cost of cleaning up the long-abandoned Elizabeth copper mine in Strafford came in more than four times the original estimate, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said. The Valley News reported that when the Superfund project to clean up the mine began in 2002, its estimated cost, in today’s dollars, was $25\n\nmillion. When the the cleanup was completed earlier this year the final price tag, released last week, came in at $103\n\nmillion. Ed Hathaway, the EPA’s Elizabeth Mine project manager, said “cost increases are very common” in the Superfund program. “We’re not building a house. We essentially are unwrapping the site as we clean it up. … As we excavate and as we do work, we uncover more of the challenges,” Hathaway said. In 2001 the EPA designated the abandoned 250-acre copper mine a Superfund site. Acid- and metal-contaminated water from the site contaminated nearby streams. Copper ore was first discovered in the area in the 1790s. Mining operations waxed and waned over the decades with economic conditions. The mine closed in 1958, leaving behind 7,800 feet of tunnels; abandoned buildings; equipment; huge piles of rock, known as tailings; and other mining debris. After the mine closed, contaminated water leached from waste rock and tailings into nearby streams, endangering animals and homes nearby.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Police are seeing an increase in thefts of catalytic converters from automobiles across the nation and in parts of Virginia. Roanoke County police officer Greg Benton told The Roanoke Times that he didn’t think catalytic converter thefts have “ever been this prolific.” Catalytic converters filter pollutants from car exhaust. They’re made with valuable precious metals and sit on the underside of a vehicle. They can be removed in a matter of minutes with a machine-powered saw. In July, insurance provider State Farm said it had seen a three-fold jump in the number of catalytic converter claims filed over the past year. The National Insurance Crime Bureau also said that the average monthly thefts across the nation had soared to 1,203 in 2020. There were 282 a month in 2019. In Roanoke City, 182 converters were reported stolen by the end of October. In all of 2020, there were about 16 thefts. In Roanoke County, Benton said thieves had made off with about 30 converters at once. Car owners can take precautions by parking in well-lit, visible areas. Illegally removing a catalytic converter can be done quickly – but not quietly. The sawing tends to make a racket.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: Residents throughout the state were preparing for possible flooding as “atmospheric rivers” again threatened parts of the Northwest, which saw heavy damage from extreme weather earlier this month. People in the small communities of Sumas and Everson in northwest Washington were asked to voluntarily evacuate Saturday night, The Bellingham Herald reported. Both towns near the Canadian border saw extreme flooding from the previous storm. Flood watches were issued for much of western and north-central Washington and the National Weather Service warned that flooding was possible through Sunday. Heavy rain and rising rivers were also expected in the Cascade mountains in the center of the state and the Olympic mountains near the coast. Meteorologists predicted the rain would taper off Sunday and that Monday should be relatively dry.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: FirstEnergy Corp. has applied to build five solar energy projects throughout its West Virginia service territory. The Akron, Ohio-based utility company estimated the projects, if approved by West Virginia regulators, would generate 50 megawatts of power, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. The plans comply with a 2020 bill passed by the state legislature that permits electric utilities to own and operate up to 200 megawatts of renewable generation facilities. They would not displace the company’s current coal-fired generation capacity, the newspaper reported. The application was submitted through FirstEnergy’s two subsidiaries, Mon Power and Potomac Edison. Construction could begin as early as 2022, with all projects expected to be completed by 2025. The sites include a 26-acre reclaimed ash disposal site in Berkeley County, a 51-acre site adjacent to a Mon Power substation in Hancock County, a 95-acre site in Monongalia County and a 44-acre reclaimed strip mine property in Tucker County. A fifth location is under review.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A community group is urging city officials to back off on plans to shut down a homeless encampment in a city park. City officials have posted notices that camping won’t be allowed in Reindahl Park on Madison’s east side after Dec. 6 and all tents, structures and belongings must be removed from the park by Dec. 9. The encampment has seen more than 70 people at times and has been declared unsanitary, unhealthy and unsafe after a number of attacks and overdoses, a stabbing and a shooting. The city wants to move people living in the park into shelters and a hotel. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that volunteer group Community Action Against Reindahl Eviction issued a statement Wednesday asking the city to halt the eviction. One of the group’s members, Pearl Foster, said the shelters and the hotel don’t have enough space for all the Reindahl campers and it shouldn’t be a problem to keep the park open because it’s not used for winter sports. Linette Rhodes, the city’s community development grants supervisor, said the city doesn’t want anyone sleeping outside during the winter and she’s confidant that all campers will have a place to go as the city shuts down the park.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: When the Republican-dominated legislature met last month to fight federal COVID-19 vaccination rules, it drew a crowd. That first day, people opposed to the federal rules crammed into the House and Senate galleries, filled two overflow rooms and gathered on the steps of the Capitol. State residents who traveled to Cheyenne fear taking a relatively new vaccine and don’t want to lose their jobs for refusing the shots, said Kristy Tyrney, the head of Wyoming Health Freedom, a grassroots group that rejects vaccine requirements. The scene in Wyoming played out across more than a dozen red-state legislatures in recent weeks as Republican lawmakers and governors pledged to fight President Joe Biden’s new immunization rules. Since September, at least 14 GOP-controlled legislatures have debated bills that would undermine vaccine mandates and passed at least 13 new laws, by Stateline’s count.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/20/noblesville-goes-old-school-make-itself-new-again/800761002/", "title": "Here's how Noblesville looks at the old to make itself new again", "text": "Of Hamilton County’s three largest cities, Noblesville might be considered the middle child — brimming with potential but sometimes overlooked.\n\nThe suburb, after all, has a historic town square, and a river runs through it — combined features Carmel and Fishers can’t claim.\n\nSo rather than re-inventing itself, as many suburbs have done with “vibrant and walkable” downtown areas built from scratch by big developers, city officials are aiming to enhance its natural gifts.\n\nTravel nightmare:Underground sinkhole jams Downtown Indianapolis traffic\n\nStaying relevant:Briggs: Indianapolis couldn't ban scooters while chasing Amazon, but they might still fail\n\nCity officials want to spruce up and remodel the square and make the White River easier to access, providing a one-two punch in which residents and visitors could comfortably busy themselves for a whole day.\n\n\"As the county seat, we have the courthouse and the square and a river in the center of downtown, and those are some major assets,\" Mayor John Ditslear said. \"We can modernize them but without losing the historical significance. I can see people coming down here to shop and eat during the day and staying at night for a concert.\"\n\nIncrease downtown density\n\nTo add muscle to the vision, Ditslear announced this week that at least one and possibly two high-end apartments with first-floor retail space would be built downtown or near downtown. The city is still entertaining proposals from developers but will likely reach an agreement by the end of the year.\n\nThat part of the overall plan is consistent with what other cities — including Carmel and Fishers — are doing as they chase the prized demographic perfecta of young professionals and well-off retirees to increase their downtown populations and spur economic activity.\n\n\"We've wanted to increase density downtown for a long time,\" Ditslear said, \"but things never really came together as they are starting to now.\"\n\nThe improvements on the square are in the final planning stages. They include wider sidewalks, mini-parks with benches, public art and entertainment in alleyways. Light fixtures and benches would be re-designed, decorative pavement would be laid down and gateway arches put up.\n\nThe changes would preserve the historical aesthetic of the square, which is lined with several local restaurants, coffee shops, clothing stores, galleries and antique sellers. A survey by the consultant, Context, Inc., which did the downtown study, found the square has 16 restaurants, eight clothing stores and seven antique shops, with most of the rest of the businesses being legal services and insurance companies.\n\nParking a problem\n\nResearchers said 68 percent of people who live, work or visit Noblesville like its historic charm more than any other element. But the study also found that their biggest complaint was a lack of parking and that they wanted to see a wider variety of businesses.\n\nMany visitors downtown are most frustrated by a two-hour parking limit on the square, said Peggy Kumler, who has owned A Corner Cottage on the square for 20 years.\n\n\"When they get ticketed, some customers get so mad they say they are never coming back,\" Kumler said. \"I've felt so bad for them that I've paid their tickets about 10 to 12 times over the years. When they get out of their cars they don't realize there's a time limit because they are so excited about shopping.\"\n\nMark Littler, who owns Noble Coffee and Tea Company with his wife, Robyn, said the city has to strike a delicate balance with parking restrictions.\n\nGrowing population: Hamilton County is growing — and fast\n\n\"For a business like mine, I don't want people taking up a space all day,\" he said. \"My business depends on quick turnover. But if you have law practice on the square and are taking a deposition, you'll probably need more than two hours.\"\n\nWidening the sidewalk would give cafes like Littler's more room for outdoor seating and pedestrians more space to window shop. But it would also mean changing the parking from vertical to parallel and that would eliminate about 20 spaces.\n\nDeputy Mayor Steve Cooke said parking garages would be included in the new mixed-use developments, which should alleviate parking on the square.\n\n\"We also have several surface lots nearby in which you can park all day,\" Cooke said. 'We need to do a better job of letting the public know those lots are there.\"\n\nWhite River development\n\nIt won't be the first time the city has upgraded the square. In the last 10 years it has spent nearly a million dollars on a program to fix up business fronts. Kumpler said she took advantage of the facade program about eight years ago, putting new windows and an awning on her shop with $14,000 from the city and $14,000 of her own.\n\nThe city is already well on its way to making the White River convenient to use. Last year, a half-mile trail along the east side of the river opened and another mile will be built soon. The Riverwalk trail will run from Division Street at Forest Park to Southside Park. Construction could begin this year.\n\nNoblesville has also punched up development west of the river to expand the boundaries of what is commonly known as downtown. Blue Sky Technology opened a large headquarters building — into which the popular restaurant Bru Burger moved — on the river, and the city built the $6 million Federal Hills Commons, a versatile park that has a band shell and ice skating rink.\n\nThe land around the river was also designated as a redevelopment district, which gives the city unlimited liquor permits to sell at a fixed price of $1,000, as a way to entice more business.\n\nTo better link the two sides of downtown, a pedestrian walkway with a look-out is being designed for the Logan Street Bridge over the White River. The walkway will be 28 feet wide and 150 feet long, county highway Director Brad Davis said. It could accommodate musicians, artists or other entertainers.\n\n\"To connect these two parts of downtown we need to make it more walkable,\" Ditslear said.\n\nZip lines and flotillas\n\nThe burgeoning riverfront development will be a starting point for further improvements being led by the city of Indianapolis and Hamilton County Tourism, Inc. The White River Master Plan will examine how to better use 58 miles of the river.\n\n\"The river is a great asset in Noblesville, but a lot of people don't even realize that it's there,\" said Brenda Myers, president of the tourism office.\n\nMyers said there is a lot of potential for \"activation,\" along the river. The county has nine parks near the water, most with at least some access. \"There is a canoe rental and boat slips and other activity on the river, but we can do more,\" Myers said, listing as possibilities flotillas, fishing piers and ziplines. Planners visited several other cities, such as Columbus, Ohio, to see what they had done with their rivers and are holding a series of public hearings to receive input.\n\nCoffee shop owner Littler said the city will thrive as long as it sticks to its roots. He said he urges city leaders all the time to improve what the city has and resist the temptation to simply imitate Carmel and Fishers.\n\n\"Noblesville offers something different,\" Littler said. \"There is a historic feel to it. It is not an urban center. It still feels like a small town, which is why people come here.\"\n\nCall IndyStar reporter John Tuohy at 317-444-6418.

That's possible?!\"\n\nSure enough, over time, these uniquely Arizona traditions pull you into the holiday spirit as much as any first dusting of snow or single-digit wind chill.\n\nAnd, hanging Christmas tree lights in balmy Arizona is so much easier. Which leads to the first of Arizona's iconic Christmas traditions — lights. Way more people seem to hang lights in Arizona and I have to believe this is because we don't get frostbitten while doing it and we're overcompensating for a lack of snow.\n\nThere are many places and events to see holiday lights in the Valley, but here are seven favorites.\n\nArizona holiday lights\n\nGlendale Glitters has been lighting up downtown Glendale since 1994.

Then I was told how it worked: Plexiglas sprayed with a \"glide-enhancing liquid.\" Westgate has moved beyond that, recently installing a real ice rink for the holidays, and plenty of plumbing beneath to keep it frozen.\n\nCity Skate in downtown Phoenix has set the bar with a real ice rink reminiscent of New York City's Rockefeller Center, minus the need for winter coats and scarves.\n\nHere are some places to skate this holiday season:\n\nCitySkate's grand opening with the mayor's tree lighting (center of the rink) is Saturday, Nov. 26.

Arizona festivals often boast just how much snow they will have for the kids to romp in.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\nEl Mirage's annual Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony is 5-9 p.m. Friday, December 9, in Gentry Park, 14010 N. El Mirage Road, and will include \"6 tons of snow.\"\n\nDetails: www.cityofelmirage.org\n\nPeoria's annual Old Town Holiday festival is 5 to 10 p.m., Friday, Dec. 2, in Old Town Peoria, located at Peoria and Grand avenues, and will feature \"20 tons of snow.\"\n\nDetails: www.peoriaaz.gov/specialevents\n\nAt the Carefree Christmas Festival, kids can \"sled down a snow slide and play in the snow.\" The festival will have \"40 tons of real snow\" and snow sculptures.

Main St. The lights will shine 5-10 nightly through Saturday, Dec. 31.\n\nBeginning Thursday, Dec. 1, high school and local choirs will perform 7-7:30 nightly through Christmas Day.\n\nHow many lights the temple uses is anybody's guess, but Harms says it would be easier to talk about it in miles than feet. A committee works year round on designs, and volunteers (about 1,500 in all) begin work in October.\n\nYou'll find a three-quarter life-size nativity scene imported from Italy, and a star above it with 10,000 lights. A collection of nativity sets are on display in the Visitors Center.\n\nWhat you won't find are Santa Claus or reindeer. \"This is entirely centered around the birth of Christ,\" Harms said, and from his perspective, it's one of the most peaceful places in the Valley to find the Christmas spirit.\n\nDetails: www.mesachristmaslights.com\n\nRepublic reporters Sonja Haller and Kellie Hwang contributed to this article.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2018/10/22/americas-50-best-cities-to-live/38207259/", "title": "What are the best cities to live in?

More than 1-in-10 Americans move each year, and suffice it to say, when it comes to choosing a place to settle down, they have options.\n\nFor many, deciding on a place to call home is influenced by subjective or personal variables like climate, proximity to friends and family, or a job opportunity. For those with greater flexibility, however, there are dozens of objective factors to consider, as overall quality of life can vary considerably from town to town and city to city.\n\nIn an ideal community, the streets are safe and those who want a job have little difficulty finding one. An ideal city is also an affordable one, a place where residents can keep more of their disposable income. A range of transportation options and easy access to entertainment and cultural attractions can also improve quality of life.\n\n24/7 Wall Street created a weighted index of over two-dozen measures to identify the best American cities to live in.

The population-adjusted concentration of venues like restaurants, movie theatres, libraries, and golf courses is far greater in Grove City than is typical nationwide.\n\n48. Snyder, Texas\n\n• Population: 11,541\n\n• 5-year population change: +4.4 percent\n\n• Median home value: $87,500 (bottom 10 percent)\n\n• Median household income: $50,325\n\nSnyder, Texas, was originally known as \"Hide Town\" for its early buffalo-hide dwellings, and \"Robber's Roost\" for the criminals that would often pass through it in the late 19th century.

Crime is virtually unheard of in Palos Verdes Estates as its violent crime rate of 22 incidents per 100,000 people is a small fraction of the national violent crime rate of 383 per 100,000.\n\nThat the city ranks among the best to live in may not come as a surprise to those familiar with it, as it is a master-planned city, designed by the Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted -- architect of New York City's Central Park and the Stanford University campus.\n\n18. Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin\n\n• Population: 14,088\n\n• 5-year population change: +0.4 percent\n\n• Median home value: $350,700 (top 20 percent)\n\n• Median household income: $105,156 (top 10 percent)\n\nWhitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb along the shore of Lake Michigan, is one of two Wisconsin cities to rank among the 50 best places to live. The high quality of life in Whitefish Bay is partially the result of a strong job market. The area's average unemployment rate over the last five years stands at just 3.2 percent -- less than half the comparable nationwide rate of of 7.4 percent.\n\nWhitefish Bay is also one of the safest communities in the country with a violent crime rate of just 36 incidents per 100,000 people.

The town's violent crime rate of 15 incidents per 100,000 people is a fraction of the 383 per 100,000 national violent crime rate. Serious financial hardship is also uncommon in Trophy Club. Just 2.2 percent of town residents live below the poverty line, well below the 15.1 percent U.S. poverty rate.\n\n16. Dickinson, North Dakota\n\n• Population: 21,985\n\n• 5-year population change: +25.3 percent (top 10 percent)\n\n• Median home value: $224,800\n\n• Median household income: $74,838\n\nLike several other North Dakota cities on this list, Dickinson has been transformed by the recent oil boom. The city has experienced one of the larger population increases in recent years among American cities, as those seeking to work in oil fields flocked to Dickinson and other areas like it. In the last half decade, Dickinson's population spiked by 25.3 percent. For reference, the U.S. population grew by just 3.9 percent over the same period.\n\nThe cost of living in Dickinson is about 12 percent lower than average nationwide, and residents tend to be relatively affluent. The city's median household income of $74,838 is nearly $20,000 higher than that of the typical American household.\n\nMore:Wealth in America: Where are cities with households averaging $70K-plus in earnings?\n\n15. Powell, Ohio\n\n• Population: 12,436\n\n• 5-year population change: +11.6 percent\n\n• Median home value: $348,000 (top 20 percent)\n\n• Median household income: $132,917 (top 10 percent)\n\nLike many cities on this list, Powell, Ohio is located only a short distance from a major city. Located just north of Columbus, Powell residents are within commuting distance of the state capital. Jobs tend to be concentrated in major cities, and many in Powell likely commute to jobs in Columbus as an average of just 3.1 percent of Powell's labor force have been out of work in the last five years.\n\nLikely thanks in part to the area's healthy economy, the city's residents also tend to have high incomes. More than half of Powell households earn more than $130,000 a year, and the city's poverty rate of just 0.3 percent is also nearly the lowest of any city in the country.\n\n14.

Just 4.0 percent of residents live below the poverty line, less than a third of the U.S. poverty rate. The typical household in Sartell earns over $16,000 more than the typical American household.\n\nThe city, which straddles the Mississippi River, has a wide array of recreational options for residents. Sartell boasts has 28 parks and 48 miles of trails. These amenities, as well as those in the nearby city of St. Cloud, make Sartell a desirable place to live. In the past seven years, the city's population has increased by more than 20 percent, nearly quadruple the 5.7 percent national population growth.\n\n12. Tega Cay, South Carolina\n\n• Population: 9,026\n\n• 5-year population change: +23.3 percent (top 10 percent)\n\n• Median home value: $301,200\n\n• Median household income: $120,346 (top 10 percent)\n\nTega Cay ranks as one of the best cities to live in part because of its relatively high income, and in part due to the many associated benefits that come with affluence. The city's median household income of over $120,000 is more than double the U.S. median. In a city where a high percentage of affluent households, there are also very few low-income residents. Just 0.9 percent of residents live in poverty.\n\nTega Cay lies near the border of the Carolinas and Lake Wiley. The water access gives residents a chance to swim, boat, and fish. As a tourist destination, the city has a high number of bars and restaurants per resident. Though it is a small town, Tega Cay is growing quickly. It was home to fewer than 5,000 people in 2009. As of 2016, more than 9,000 people lived there.\n\n11. Carroll, Iowa\n\n• Population: 9,990\n\n• 5-year population change: -0.9 percent (bottom 20 percent)\n\n• Median home value: $137,600\n\n• Median household income: $45,170\n\nOne of the safest cities in the country, Carroll's violent crime rate of 20 incidents per 100,000 people is a fraction of the national violent crime rate of 383 per 100,000. Low crime rates tend to occur in areas where few residents struggle to find work, and joblessness is also not a problem for most of the Carroll labor force. Over the last five years, average unemployment in the city stood at 1.6 percent, well below the comparable 7.4 percent national rate.\n\nCarroll residents have access to a dozen parks, several miles of trails, two golf courses, a brewing company, a winery and vineyard, and college and high school baseball games at the Merchants Park stadium.\n\nMore:Wealth in America: Where are cities with households averaging less than $45K in earnings?\n\n10.

The city's violent crime rate of 64 incidents for every 100,000 people is among the lowest in the nation, as is the city's five-year average unemployment rate of 2.7 percent.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nFor those familiar with some of the cities on this list, their ranking among the best places to live in the country may not come as a surprise. Generally, the places on this list have low violent and property crime rates. Even if not always affluent, they are usually affordable. They are also often steeped in history, culture, and opportunities for entertainment.\n\nResidents of the cities on this list also often take an active interest in the quality of their community. In Mandan, North Dakota, for example, business leaders, elected officials, and ordinary citizens formed a committee to enact a comprehensive plan to improve the city over the coming decade. The committee’s accomplishments include broadened business support and incentives, the creation of annual festivals and events, public education improvements, and increased communication regarding local elections.\n\nMore:Looking to find a job? These US cities are having an employment slump\n\nOther cities on this list, like Trophy Club, Texas and Palos Verdes Estates, California are master-planned communities, purposefully designed and built to be ideal places to live.\n\nA disproportionate share of cities on this list -- 31 out of 50 -- are located in the Midwest. Meanwhile, just three communities in the Northeast rank among the best cities to live. This is largely attributable to cost of living.\n\nOnly about 10 percent of towns and cities in the Midwest have a higher cost of living than the nationwide average. Conversely, in 78 percent of cities and towns in the Northeast, goods and services are more expensive on average than they are nationwide.\n\nMany of the best cities to live in are suburbs of much larger cities. Jobs tend to be concentrated in major cities, which partially explains the low unemployment rates in many communities on this list. Several cities on this list are within commuting distance of major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, and Washington D.C.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify the best cities to live in, 24/7 Wall Street created a weighted index of 25 measures that fall into one of four categories: affordability, economy, quality of life, and community.\n\nIn the affordability category, the ratio of the median home value to the median income was given full weight. Cities where the median home value is closer to the median household income were rewarded. Cost of living, as determined by the average cost of goods and services in an area relative to the nation as a whole, was given a full weight. Property taxes are largely levied at the local level, and cities where residents pay more property taxes as a percent of their home value were penalized. Property taxes were given a one-quarter weighting.\n\nIn the economy category, we gave median household income full weighting. The unemployment rate was also given a full weight. We used five-year average unemployment due to lack of comparable annual data at local levels. Two-year employment growth and share of the total working age population with a job were each given a half weight, favoring areas with more and growing jobs opportunities.\n\nMore:Here are the top 40 places where young people are moving\n\nIn the quality of life category, the poverty rate was given a full weight, penalizing cities where serious financial hardship is more common. The share of the population that struggles to put food on the table either due to low income or distance from a grocery store, known as the food insecurity rate, was given full weight. A city’s mortality rate, calculated as the number of people who died while in hospital care per hospital by city, was also given full weight. In cases where city level data was not available, mortality rates were imputed from county level data.\n\nThe drug overdose mortality rate was given a one-quarter weighting, as was the hospital readmission rate, or the share of those released from the hospital who were readmitted within 30 days. Distance from the center of the city to the nearest hospital was given full weight.\n\nMeasures used in the community category include the average travel time to work, which was given full weight. The violent crime rate -- the total number of rapes, robberies, murders, and aggravated assaults adjusted per 100,000 people -- was given full weight. So too was the property crime rate, which is the total number of burglaries, larcenies, motor vehicle thefts, and incidents of arson per 100,000 people.\n\nThe share of commuters either walking, cycling, or taking public transit to work was given half weight. The total number of colleges in the area and the number of restaurants, bars, museums, theatre companies, movie theatres, libraries, and parks per capita were each given a one-quarter weighting.\n\nThe number of hospitalizations that would have been prevented by regularly scheduled doctor visits for every 1,000 Medicare enrollees -- known as the preventable hospitalization rate -- was given half weighting.\n\nMore:Which state tops list for having the best and worst economies?\n\nTo avoid geographic clustering, we only took the top-ranking city in a given county. Our list includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and Census designated places. We did not include places with fewer than 8,000 residents in our analysis.\n\nMedian household income, median home value, average travel time to work, poverty rate, population, employment-to-population ratio, median property taxes paid, and average unemployment rate are all five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and are for 2016. Overall cost of living is for 2014 and comes from data analysis and aggregation company ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe population-adjusted number of entertainment and cultural venues like restaurants and museums comes from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns data set, and is for 2016. The number of colleges comes from the Department of Education College Navigator and is as of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nViolent and property crime rates are from the FBI’s 2017 Uniform Crime Report. Drug overdose mortality rates are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are for the years 2014-2016. Mortality rates and hospital readmission rates are from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and are as of June 2015. Preventable hospitalizations are from the latest release from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy said one of the team’s goals is to help stem the loss of young professionals from the area.\n\n“What you’re seeing there (in Titletown District) is what Millennials especially are looking for,” said Peter Zaehringer, vice president of economic development for the Greater Green Bay Chamber. “It’s a place that is walkable. It’s a place where you can live, where you can shop, where you can hang out with your family, your animal, your kids. That’s what we’re looking for when it comes to talent retention and attraction to the Green Bay area.”\n\nThe Titletown District will include 10 acres of plaza, including an ice skating pond in winter, an event area and a football field-sized green space. The Lombardi Avenue side of the Titletown District will include 200,000 square feet of retail, dining and entertainment businesses in multiple buildings. Brookwood Drive will include 30 to 50 two-story townhouses fronting their neighbors and with patios facing the 10-acre park, which runs through the middle of the development.\n\nThe public space will include, nearest South Ridge Road on the east, a grassy area designed for events and festivals. In the center of the park will be an area that in winter will be a full-sized skating rink landscaped to look like a pond. It will include sculpted rocks, reminiscent of Wisconsin Dells formations, that people can skate between and around. At the western end of the development will be a football field-sized grass space with football markings, though it will be a park and not an athletic field.\n\nWork could start this year with anticipated openings by the anchors before the start of the 2017 football season.\n\nPackers President and CEO Mark Murphy said the Titletown District will have its own identity, distinct from the Packers and Lambeau Field. That’s one reason they decided not to build on Lambeau property.\n\n“We also didn’t want to impact tailgaiting at Lambeau. We know that is important to our fans,” he said.\n\nLambeau Field and Brown County have seen growth from destination travelers and Murphy said the Titletown District would add to that. He said the team experienced record numbers of visitors in June and July.\n\nThat benefits the entire region, said Ashwaubenon village president Mike Aubinger.\n\n“The Green Bay Packers have formed a community. That community spills over to include all of our visitors,” Aubinger said.\n\nThe Packers goal is to have the plaza in use much of the year and will be forming focus groups for public input on the kinds of events and activities people would like to see.\n\nThe Packers own more than 65 acres east, west and south of Lambeau Field, including the proposed development area along Lombardi Avenue between South Ridge Road and Marlee Lane. All of their land is in the village of Ashwaubenon.\n\nInitial development along South Ridge Road will cost $120 million to $130 million. That includes the $28.6 million the Packers paid for the land in the development area, plus demolition costs for buildings there and infrastructure improvements. Total team investment will be about $65 million, said Ed Policy, vice president and general counsel.\n\nThe Packers hand-picked the three tenants. Each is a premium Wisconsin name, Policy said.\n\n“It was important to us that they commit to use Titletown as a major growth platform,” he said.\n\nThe four-star Lodge Kohler will have 150 rooms on five floors, an indoor/outdoor pool and gardens, a spa and a fitness center. It will have limited event and meeting space, instead using Lambeau Field for those services.\n\n“This is the first (hotel) we’ve built from scratch outside of Kohler,” said Herbert Kohler Jr., chairman of Kohler Co. “It’s going to be a product we think we might be able to take elsewhere. It’s an excellent place to start.”\n\nThe Packers see use of Lambeau Field, already a year-round attraction for business meetings, parties and weddings, as a source of revenue growth. The team is adding two high-end board rooms with a view of the 50-foot Lombardi Trophy replica to enhance its meeting offerings.\n\nBoth the Packers and Kohler look to grow their executive retreat business.\n\n“Our thought is Lambeau Field has the most unique and inspiring meeting space in the nation,” Policy said.\n\nHinterland Brewery plans a 20,000- to 25,000-square-foot brewery, tap room and restaurant, compared to the 9,000 square feet in its downtown Green Bay building. It will move all its operations to the Titletown District, but owner Bill Tressler said Copper Rock Coffee of Appleton will buy Hinterland’s downtown building.\n\nThe brewery produced about 5,500 barrels of beer last year, but Hinterland will increase capacity to 20,000 at the new location. It will offer brewery tours and have two dining rooms, one with the tap room and a more intimate one on the second floor, and start lunch service. It will offer craft beer and merchandise sales, as well.\n\n“I think the partners are great partners for sure,” Tressler said. “Each one will bring something different to the experience over there and I think there is some overlap in target customers.”\n\nBellin Health’s sports medicine clinic will be more convenient for Dr. Patrick McKenzie, the Packers’ medical director, and the players he treats, but it also will be available to the public.\n\n“One goal is to have a facility that’s more convenient for him and the players,” said George Kerwin, president and CEO of Bellin Health. “We also want to offer the community a broader array of services offered to athletes.”\n\nThe approximately 30,000-square-foot clinic will offer diagnostics, labs and MRI services as well as medical care and physical therapy.\n\n— Contact rryman@greenbaypressgazette.com.

The Alabama Department of Public Health announced the 2018 infant mortality rate was the lowest in Alabama history with 7.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. It is an improvement over the 2017 rate of 7.4 and the 2016 rate of 9.1. However, Alabama’s mortality rate remains higher than the provisional U.S. rate of 5.7. A total of 405 infants born in 2018 in Alabama died before reaching their first birthday. There also remains a racial disparity in infant mortality rates, with the rate for black infants in Alabama at 11.0 in 2018, more than twice the infant mortality rate for white infants at 5.1.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed a state budget Wednesday that would rely heavily on savings, after a push for deep cuts during his first year in office resulted in fierce public backlash that fueled a recall effort. The new proposal leaves room for discussion on what services the state should provide and how it should pay for them, says Brett Huber, a top adviser to the Republican governor. Dunleavy wants lawmakers to look at formula programs seen as cost drivers, which could include Medicaid and education. Brian Fechter, with the Office of Management and Budget, says the governor’s office currently isn’t planning to introduce legislation proposing specific changes but expects to engage with the Legislature on the issue. Dunleavy told reporters he is not proposing cuts to K-12 education but plans to roll out initiatives aimed at improving student outcomes.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Alice Cooper will join the three surviving bandmates with whom he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010 at his 18th annual Christmas Pudding concert at the Celebrity Theatre. The Saturday show also features Johnny Depp, Rob Halford, Debbie Sledge of Sister Sledge, Joe Bonamassa and another celebrated Cooper bandmate, lead guitarist Nita Strauss, to name a few. All proceeds benefit the free music, dance, arts and vocational programs for youth ages 12-20 at Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Center in Phoenix. Before the inaugural Pudding in 2001, Cooper said that “this show is going to be like if you went to a party and everybody got up and did a few songs. And everybody is going to get pudding.” The pudding is provided by acclaimed local chef Mark Tarbell.\n\nArkansas\n\nHighfill: The airport serving northwest Arkansas and surrounding areas will be renamed the Northwest Arkansas National Airport, airport authority board members decided Wednesday. Previously known as Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, it will retain its XNA airport code, officials said. “The name is a perception thing. It is how people view us,” said Andrew Branch, chief business development officer at XNA. “When we talk to airlines, when we talk to UPS, FedEx in the future, how will we be perceived when they first see our name? Will they think we’re a smaller airport when we say we’re regional?” According to the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, passenger boardings are up by nearly 17% so far this year at the airport in Highfill. The airport plans to update its signs and website with the new name, but officials said the cost will be minimal.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: There’s new hope for an endangered frog that has vanished from half of its habitat. The state Fish and Game Commission on Wednesday approved protections for five of six populations of the foothill yellow-legged frog. The Center for Biological Diversity had sought protection for the stream-dwelling amphibians under California’s Endangered Species Act. The commission voted to list the frogs as endangered in the Southern Sierra, central and southern coasts. Populations in the Northern Sierra and the Feather River will be listed as threatened. The commission determined frogs on the state’s northern coast “do not currently warrant protection,” the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement. The tiny, pebbly-skinned frogs were once found from Los Angeles County to the Oregon border, but their populations have shrunk thanks to threats from human encroachment, dams, climate change, pollution, and activities ranging from logging and mining to marijuana growing.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civilian oversight group says the Denver Sheriff Department hasn’t maintained a required list of deputies found to have credibility issues. It doesn’t know why, but the department now is reviewing thousands of internal affairs cases to create the list, The Denver Post reports. Civilian oversight officials expect to find 40 to 70 deputies with histories of lying, bias or even criminal convictions. The list is important because prosecutors in criminal cases are required to give defense attorneys any evidence that could help the accused. And a judge could rule that testimony provided by a deputy on the list is inadmissible. It’s unclear why the department never created a list, said Denver Department of Public Safety Director Troy Riggs. Denver police began creating a list in 2008.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: The heated debate over whether to bring back the town high school’s Native American-themed mascot left the school without an official athletic nickname days before the football team plays in a state championship game Saturday. The nine-member Killingly Board of Education on Wednesday night voted to rescind Killingly High School’s new Red Hawks mascot but stopped short of reinstating the former Redmen name, the Norwich Bulletin reports. The vote came at the end of more than two hours of sometimes contentious public comments. The issue returned after several Republican candidates ran on a platform of restoring the Redmen name. The previous school board had effectively voted to drop it last June. In October, the same board approved the new name after it was overwhelmingly approved by students.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bitter, drawn-out labor dispute between the city and its fire union has resurfaced over the city’s proposal for a new shift schedule that would require firefighters to work 13 additional days a year. Mayor Mike Purzycki’s administration says the change would eliminate the need for rolling bypass, the controversial practice of shutting down an engine to save on overtime cost. The International Association of Firefighters Local 1590, which represents Wilmington firefighters, objects to the change, contending the city will cut the days off that firefighters need to recuperate from long shifts and traumatic emergency scenes. “There are days we see our friends get hurt, or we do CPR on somebody who’s been married for 60 years, or we’ve pulled kids out of burning buildings that died in our arms,” said Local 1590 President Joe Leonetti. “That’s something we live with every day.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Council member Robert White is spearheading an effort demanding Mayor Muriel Bowser quicken the pace of testing and fixing lead in playground rubber, WUSA-TV reports. The little rubber pieces children play on and with may actually be poisonous. First exposed by parent-commissioned tests in May, elevated levels of lead were found inside the recycled tire pieces making up play mats. Children exposed to lead face developmental and hormonal problems. For White, the danger is personal. “My daughter attends a school where they found elevated levels of lead in the playground she uses,” White said. He led several council members in writing a letter to Bowser demanding she speed up the testing and find a solution.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state has been accepted to the Electronic Registration Information Center, a multistate network created by the PEW Charitable Trusts to improve the accuracy of voter registration systems. Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office announced the news this week, as part of the state’s ongoing efforts to root out election security and fraud problems prior to the upcoming 2020 elections. In August, the state had asked to join the multistate network, which uses “a sophisticated and secure data-matching tool” to compare official data on eligible voters to keep voter rolls up to date. Databases include voter and motor vehicle registrations, U.S. Postal Service addresses and Social Security death records.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is putting up nearly $1.5 million to help control the state’s wild hog population. Georgia Public Broadcasting reports the funding is part of a program called the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program. A state resource conservationist with the department says money will go to controlling the population and educating people about the impact the animals have on natural resources and wildlife. Wild hogs are an aggressive invasive species that threatens everything from farms to endangered sea turtles in Georgia. Some of the funding will also go to restoration efforts. The Georgia Association of Conservation Districts says feral swine caused an estimated $150 million in damages to crops and natural resources in the state last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A pilot project to test the use of artificial turf on road median strips on Oahu has had mixed results, officials say. The artificial turf has worked well in some of Oahu’s nine city council districts, while others have experienced problems, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Honolulu launched the $1 million pilot project to install artificial turf in nine medians, roundabouts and other traffic spaces in February 2016, officials say. Some of the 3-year-old turf has been damaged, while the turf on one median has become encircled with weeds due to errors made during installation. But the artificial grass on another median looks so realistic that a resident used a riding mower to cut it, an official says. Honolulu Councilwoman Kymberly Pine hopes the project will lead to reduced water use and landscaping maintenance but says the cost benefits have yet to be determined.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Ada County Sheriff’s Office is asking a judge to hold the Idaho Department of Correction in contempt for failing to quickly remove state inmates from the county jail. Sheriff Steve Bartlett says county taxpayers are paying for inmates who have been sentenced to prison but continue to be held at the jail facility, which is designed to hold low-level offenders or people waiting for trial or sentencing. He wants the judge to enforce a decades-old court order that requires IDOC to remove inmates from the Ada County Jail within seven days of learning the inmates have been sentenced to state custody. “The Ada County Jail has 1,116 beds – and we’ve been right up to the edge of our capacity for several years now. Jails should be at 85% capacity or less to ensure staff can manage the population at peak efficiency and safety,” Bartlett says.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two Chicago Park District workers escaped without serious injury after the salt truck they were navigating along an icy lakefront bike path slid into Lake Michigan. The pickup truck hit a slick spot and slipped backward into the water on Chicago’s Near North Side about 7:20 a.m. Wednesday, said Dep. District Chief Jason Lach of the Chicago Fire Department Marine Dive Operations. It slid halfway into the water before getting caught on a breakwall. The two occupants were able to escape the sinking vehicle and crawl to safety, and both are in good condition. Light snow blanketed the Chicago area early Wednesday, with temperatures at about 17 degrees, the National Weather Service said. The snow and cold left a heavy ice buildup along the bike path. “They were out there salting the area, and the truck slid in,” Park District spokeswoman Michelle Lemons told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue is looking for pets to volunteer as participants in a national study looking at the general health and wellness of dogs. The Dog Aging Project is a collaboration by more than 40 scientists and researchers across the U.S. and will be looking at dogs of all breeds, mixes and ages. Purdue’s Audrey Ruple, an assistant professor of One Health Epidemiology in the College of Health and Human Sciences and one of the researchers leading the study, is hoping to recruit dogs from across Indiana. A veterinary epidemiologist specializing in dogs as a model of human health, Ruple says the goal of the study is to examine factors that maximize the health and longevity of dogs, which can be linked to the health and longevity of humans. The Dog Aging Project will follow participating dogs to watch how different environmental and biological factors can affect longevity for the next 10 years, though the schedule could extend beyond that time.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: As of Thursday, felons who discharge their sentence from a prison in the state or complete their parole will be given a nearly completed application to restore their voting rights. Each felon in Iowa must apply individually to the governor’s office to have their voting rights restored – one of the most restrictive processes in the country. But that process is becoming simpler. Iowa Department of Corrections Director Beth Skinner said her department was rolling out a system to auto-complete 12 of the 14 questions on the voting rights restoration application. An officer will then work with the inmate to complete the last two questions as part of their discharge from the correctional system, Skinner said. “It’s going to be all auto-populated for them so they don’t have to go back and look for old offenses and dates,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The State Board of Education has voted to encourage school districts to pass strict vaping bans. The policy approved unanimously this week calls for prohibiting students and staff from using, possessing or promoting any tobacco products, including vape pens, while they’re on school property, in school vehicles or at activities, The Kansas City Star reports. The board also wants districts to bar parents, volunteers, contractors and vendors from using any tobacco products and e-cigarettes “in any district facility, in school vehicles, at school-sponsored activities, programs or events, and on school owned property at all times.” Kathy Busch, the board’s chairwoman, called the policy recommendation “quite inclusive and definitive.” Many school districts have sued leading e-cigarette maker Juul, including those in Shawnee Mission, Blue Valley and Olathe.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s’s embattled education commissioner resigned Thursday, handing new Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear what he wanted in reshaping the management in the education system to reflect his opposition to charter schools. The state’s newly reorganized state school board accepted Wayne Lewis’ immediate resignation at a special meeting. Beshear set Lewis’ removal in motion Tuesday when he disbanded the Kentucky Board of Education and then recreated it with 11 new members on his first day in office, fulfilling a campaign pledge. During his run for governor, Beshear said he hoped the reorganization would lead to Lewis’ removal. The new board’s chairman, David Karem, called it an “amicable resolution” to Lewis’ status and said his departure was consistent with the goals of the the state’s 30-year-old education reform law.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state law that automatically transfers 15-year-old suspects to adult court if they are indicted by a grand jury for certain violent crimes was upheld Wednesday by the Louisiana Supreme Court. The 4-3 ruling came in the case of a suspect who had just turned 15 when he was accused of raping a child. A lower court ruled that transferring him from juvenile to a regular criminal court following his indictment – without a hearing on whether he should be transferred – was an unconstitutional violation of due process. The lower court cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding that juveniles should be treated differently from adults in sentencing, according to the ruling. The lower court said a transfer to regular criminal court for adults imposes “a significant deprivation of liberty” and warrants protection under the Constitution’s due process clause and that the transfer shouldn’t take place until a court has determined the suspect wouldn’t benefit from juvenile court programs. The high court disagreed.\n\nMaine\n\nBlue Hill: There’s no Tinder for waterfowl, but that didn’t stop a bird owner from trying to find a match for a mourning duckling. One of Chris Morris’ ducks, Yellow Duck, lost its mate to a hungry bobcat a couple of weeks ago at Morris’ yard in Blue Hill. Morris, a 31-year-old special education teacher, drew up a singles ad for Yellow Duck and placed it on a community bulletin board at a local grocery store. The ad declares: “Duck seeking duck. Lonesome runner duck seeks companion. Partner recently deceased.” It also includes an email address dedicated to the dating search and states, “serious replies only.” The Bangor Daily News reports farm owner Sadie Greene might have just the duck to mend Yellow Duck’s broken heart. Greene and Morris are arranging a meeting for the ducks Sunday. Yellow Duck’s favorite food is slugs, and they might be on the menu for the big date, Morris said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state would invest millions of dollars to fight violent crime and would strengthen penalties for repeat gun-violence offenders and witness intimidation, under a package of initiatives announced Wednesday by Gov. Larry Hogan. Hogan’s proposed state budget would pay for 25 new prosecutors and support staff for the attorney general to prosecute violent crimes. He also announced an additional $21 million for the city of Baltimore and the state’s attorney’s office. He made the announcement in Baltimore, where there have been more than 300 homicides each year for five years straight. The Republican governor is proposing a new strategy to reduce youth violence in the city. He also said he plans to push for legislation to publish sentencing records of judges in violent crime cases to hold them more accountable for their sentencing decisions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Local lawmakers imposed new limits on police in immigration matters Wednesday in response to revelations the department has been closely coordinating with federal authorities for years despite a sanctuary city policy. The City Council approved changes to the city’s 5-year-old Trust Act, which limits the role city officials play in enforcing the nation’s immigration laws. Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh said the changes, which his office developed along with City Councilor Josh Zakim, are meant to reassure residents that Boston police remain focused on public safety, not civil immigration enforcement. Marcos Charles, who heads U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Boston office, says laws like Boston’s Trust Act make communities less safe. But the American Civil Liberties Union says city leaders should have gone further in their new restrictions.\n\nMichigan\n\nEscanaba: A 59-year-old man who told his lawyer he wanted to rob an Upper Peninsula business so he could return to prison could be locked up for the rest of his life. Mark Wilson, of Portage, was sentenced Monday to at least 25 years in prison, a sentence that was enhanced because of past convictions. It means he won’t be eligible for parole until he’s in his 80s. “Somewhere along the road, your honor, I just seemed to have lost the ability to function normally with society,” Wilson told a Delta County judge. “I would like to say to the people that I apologize in the most sincere manner for my behavior” last July. The Daily Press reports that Wilson gave a note to a Hardee’s employee in Escanaba, indicating that he was robbing the restaurant. Police say he then stayed in the restroom until officers arrived.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The city is the latest to consider banning conversion therapy aimed at changing a person’s sexual orientation. A proposal to ban the practice was introduced at a City Council meeting this week, with member Gary Anderson citing a lack of action by the Legislature, where a proposed statewide conversion therapy ban failed earlier this year. Minneapolis recently became the first Minnesota city to ban conversion therapy. Opponents to similar bans argue such ordinances violate freedom of religion or speech. Duluth’s ban would apply to minors and be enforced through fines. Jamie Conniff, a family medicine physician in Duluth who is gay, says he often works with young LGBT patients, many of whom he says “struggle against the message something’s wrong with them.” The Duluth council could vote on the ban next week.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a military family who says they were sickened by toxic mold at Keesler Air Force Base. U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr.’s ruling dismissed one of 14 lawsuits filed against Hunt Southern Group and Hunt MH Property Management, the owner and property manager of housing at the base in Biloxi, The Sun Herald reports. The family failed to established through expert medical witnesses that their illnesses were specifically caused by the housing’s mold, he noted, adding that experts only said that mold could generally cause the family’s illnesses. The family has complained of chest pain, rhinitis, fatigue, headaches, rashes, dermatitis, vomiting and more. Court-ordered medical examinations concluded mold exposure wasn’t behind the family’s sickness.\n\nMissouri\n\nPatton: A southeast Missouri school district was flooded with complaints over the latest school-sponsored raccoon hunt, a tradition that dates back 37 years. The Banner Press reports more than 2,200 people across the country signed an online petition to end last weekend’s hunt, for which 94 raccoons were brought in. FFA adviser Sarah Burgfeld says she and other officials in the Meadow Heights district received so many phone calls and emails that she filed a harassment complaint with the Bollinger County Sheriff’s Department, citing name-calling and vulgarity. She says the event generally raises $500 to $600, although that’s not the focus. She says hunting provides “multi-generational, traditional bonding.” Jack Coomer, president of Castor River Coon Hunters, says the raccoons either went home with the hunters or were given to a man who utilizes them for food and their pelts.\n\nMontana\n\nHamilton: An animal shelter is caring for 39 huskies found on a property in western Montana. Bitter Root Humane Association operations manager Cyra Saltzman says the dogs, including two litters of puppies, were rounded up the Monday before Thanksgiving on land northeast of Hamilton. Saltzman tells the Ravalli Republic some of the dogs are more socialized, while others were wild. The shelter first learned of the huskies when a spay and neuter group called to report someone had dropped off a dog that needed its leg amputated because it appeared to have been shot. A second report came from a landowner reporting three dogs running free. Eventually Saltzman and others found a property where a large number of huskies were running free. Saltzman said she could not talk about the dogs’ former owner. The youngest puppies are in foster care and not yet available for adoption, Saltzman says.\n\nNebraska\n\nShelton: A fire Wednesday morning destroyed a historic church near this central Nebraska city. The fire at the Zion Lutheran Church was reported just after 7 a.m., and firefighters who arrived minutes later found the structure was engulfed in flames. Shelton Fire Chief Jason Wiehn said the church was destroyed. Fighting the fire was complicated by a lack of water, which forced trucks to return to Shelton and Ravenna to fill up with more water, he said. The church, which was built in the early 1900s, was about 10 miles northwest of Shelton. Church member Rick Pope told KSNB-TV the fire was visible miles away at his home. “I live about 5 miles away and could see a glow,” he said. “My son called me about that same time, and we came up and watched it burn down.” The cause of the fire hasn’t been determined.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The city is either buying or saying goodbye to the Space Whale, which has been a centerpiece of downtown’s City Plaza since 2017. Principal artist Matt Schultz says he has offered the city the two life-sized, stained glass whale sculptures at the price of $500,000. It’s uncertain if the city is going to bite. “The city doesn’t have an appetite to lease it anymore,” says Alexis Hill, the city’s arts, culture and special events manager. “It was always a temporary piece. It would be really sad to see it go, but the (Reno Arts and Culture Commission) is really excited to have a new piece if we don’t proceed with the Space Whale’s purchase.” The city, which has leased and purchased several other Burning Man sculptural installations, leased the whale for a total of $64,000, paid for through the city’s room tax. That contract ended in August. But “everyone wants the Space Whale to stay,” Schultz says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCharlestown: The Episcopal Church of New Hampshire is launching a new training program to make becoming a priest easier. The diocese will offer a certificate program that requires students to attend nine in-person weekend trainings, according to church officials. In addition to the training sessions, students will complete an online curriculum, provided by the Iona center. Traditionally, becoming a priest requires three years of training at seminary school, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. “This really makes it easier for people to answer that call, whether that call to ministry comes in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s – we even have people doing this post-retirement,” says Tina Pickering, who works in ministry development for the church.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The process of placing marijuana legalization on the 2020 ballot is officially underway. The Assembly Oversight Committee on Thursday held a public hearing on the constitutional amendment that, if placed on the ballot and passed, would make New Jersey the 12th state to legalize weed for recreational purposes. “We have people whose lives are being ruined because the law prohibits the use of marijuana,” said Assemblyman Joe Danielsen, D-Middlesex, who chairs the committee. “We’re not doing this responsibly.” Both houses are scheduled to vote on the ballot bill Monday. If three-fifths of all members approve the legal weed ballot measure, it will be placed on the November 2020 ballot. Otherwise, both houses would have to approve the ballot bill again.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Records show state agricultural officials are approving fewer licenses for the use of cyanide bombs – a device deployed by ranchers to kill coyotes. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports records show state-issued licenses for cyanide bombs has declined from 86 in 2015 and 2016 to 54 in 2019. That’s a 37% reduction. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last week reauthorized the use of devices known as cyanide bombs targeting coyotes. Ranchers say they still need the devices, also known as M-44s, to kill hungry coyotes, which can cost the industry thousands of dollars a year in livestock losses. Environmentalists say the devices are a horrible way to kill coyotes and point to collateral damage inflicted on dogs and other animals. They say M-44s also present a risk for humans – even killing a Utah man last year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is prohibiting the aerial spraying of an agricultural pesticide that can harm the nervous systems of infants and young children. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he’s directing the state Department of Environmental Conservation to ban nearly all uses of the pesticide by December 2020. But New York will allow the spraying of the pesticide on apple tree trunks until July 2021. Environmental group Friends of the Earth says the pesticide also poses the risk of acute poisoning and neurological damage in farm workers. Lawmakers approved a bill this spring to prohibit the pesticide. Environmental groups have since pushed Cuomo to act to ban the pesticide, chlorpyrifos, used on golf courses and crops including corn, soybeans and broccoli. Apple farmers have argued that chlorpyrifos is the only pesticide available for use against pests such as the rosy apple aphid.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made little progress providing every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” since the state Supreme Court declared the constitutional mandate in 1997, according to a report released this week addressing public education shortfalls and student achievement. The findings from California-based WestEd stem from a trial judge’s order last year seeking an outside group to recommend a pathway to comply fully with the so-called Leandro decision – named after one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging funding for poor school systems. Some proposals in the report suggest it could cost several billion dollars over eight years to comply. It’s difficult for a judge to force the General Assembly to spend the money, however, because legislators appropriate state funds.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group of women who farm or work in agriculture recently attended a unique, one-day class at North Dakota State University to learn about the ins and outs of farm commodities, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. As more women around the country get involved in the day-to-day business of managing farms, they’ll need these skills to help decide when to sell crops for the optimum return. In the university’s commodity trading lab, the class learns about the futures market, where traders buy and sell contracts to deliver corn or soybeans in the future. The actual grain never changes hands. But the prices set on the futures market directly affect the cash price, what farmers get when they haul grain to the elevator.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Two birding groups filed a federal lawsuit trying to block a planned wind farm in Lake Erie, saying the project poses a danger to birds that fly through the area. The groups said the proposed six-turbine wind farm for just off the shore of Cleveland “would pose substantial collision risks to the enormous numbers of birds that use the area throughout the year, including large concentrations of migrating songbirds.” The U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have failed to evaluate the environmental impacts of the project and alternatives as required by the National Environmental Policy Act and the federal Clean Water Act, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. The Energy Department and the Army Corps declined to comment. If approved, the wind farm would be the first offshore wind farm in the Great Lakes, The Blade reports.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Scissortail Park, the city’s new downtown green space and gathering place, is planning its inaugural holiday celebration, the Sugar Plum Promenade, from 5 to 9 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. The sprawling new park is getting in on the festive fun with a holiday train, free photos with Santa, hot chocolate, s’mores, children’s crafts, strolling performers, costumed characters and more. Admission is free, although some activities have small fees. For more information, go to scissortailpark.org.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Some 200 hand-blown glass ornaments have been hidden in the Willamette National Forest to kick off the Willamette Valley Visitors Association’s second annual ornament hunt, which officially began Nov. 29 and will last until Jan. 1. Becca Barnhart, the marketing and public relations manager for the visitors association, says 40 of the 200 ornaments had been found and claimed as of Tuesday. Ornaments were hidden along approximately 1,700 miles of trails. People who find an ornament can also register to win one of three grand prizes: dinner, an activity or an overnight stay in the Willamette Valley. Those who find one are encouraged to use the hashtags #FindYourOrnament” #FindYourTrail and #IwonderWV on social media. More information is available online.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBloomsburg: A farm that supplies vaccine manufacturers is donating nearly 100,000 surplus eggs to a central Pennsylvania food bank that’s scrambling to get them to needy families. The Bloomsburg Press Enterprise reports the eggs are too small or too large for the drug-making process, so they are going to help families in Columbia and Montour counties. A charity picked up about 8,000 dozen eggs this week, driving them away in a box truck. Only about 100 were broken in the one-hour journey. Volunteers had stockpiled hundreds of egg cartons to prepare for the donation. The eggs don’t need to be refrigerated and can last about two weeks. The food bank expects to distribute them to food pantries, fire halls and churches, expecting that holiday baking will provide a demand for the eggs. It’s the third year the farm has made the donation – two years ago it amounted to 320,000 eggs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Board of Elections is advancing a proposal that would allow candidates to use campaign funds to pay for child care expenses, as federal candidates now can. The board voted to put the proposal out for public comment. Lawyer Raymond Marcaccio told the board on Monday that this plan would only cover child care costs that are incurred because a parent is running for office, The Providence Journal reports. Marcaccio said the proposed language is similar to that used by the Federal Election Commission. The Rhode Island Senate approved similar legislation in June, but the bill did not make it through the House. “It’s obvious that this is necessary,” said Stephen Erickson, the board commissioner. “Child-care expenditures can be an impediment to somebody holding office or running for office, and so this seem eminently reasonable.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: One of the state’s most liberal lawmakers and one of its most conservative are joining together to revive the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 1970s proposal banning any discrimination based on sex is being revived in several state capitols across the U.S. It is just one state away from the 38 needed before it can become the 28th amendment to the Constitution. But there is another hurdle: a ratification deadline. Congress extended an initial 1979 deadline to 1982. Supporters acknowledge they will likely need the current Congress to grant another extension. Barring that, they will have to go to court. Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, D-Orangeburg, introduced a resolution in January to ratify the amendment in South Carolina. She was joined Wednesday by state Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, who served as former Gov. Mark Sanford’s chief of staff.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A new “Hemp. We’re On It.” website is taking aim at Gov. Kristi Noem’s opposition to legalizing industrial hemp. The Libertarian Party of South Dakota created the website onhemp.org and “Hemp. We’re On It.” logo, both of which mirror Noem’s recent anti-meth campaign “Meth. We’re On It” and website onmeth.com that went viral in November. “Misinformation” about industrial hemp is “everyone’s problem,” and it remains illegal in South Dakota due to Noem’s “misguided stances,” the Libertarian Party says on its website. “But we can approach this problem from different angles, so one person doesn’t prevent our counties, towns and neighborhoods from benefiting from this versatile crop.” South Dakota is one of three states that haven’t legalized industrial hemp.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Knox County has voted against creating new rules for Bible Release Time and similar programs, despite concerns about what happens when some students are pulled from their classrooms for religious studies. With a 5-4 vote Wednesday night, the Knox County Board of Education decided not to create more standards for these programs, news outlets report. Tennessee law already lets parents pull their children from school for religious studies. A pilot program was allowed in Knox County on the condition that it was conducted off school property and not funded by taxpayer money. Board members were voting on additional protocols that would formalize the program. Proposals included setting specific dates and times when students could be taken out to minimize classroom disruptions, and requiring the religious institutions to have liability insurance and perform background checks on people interacting with children.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The percentage of the state’s youngest children without health insurance has increased since 2016, according to a report released Wednesday. In 2018, 8.3% of Texas children under age 6 – a total of 198,014 – were uninsured. The rate has grown by 1 percentage point, or about 23,000 children, since 2016, according to a report by Georgetown University Health Policy Institute. The data mirrors growth seen in the uninsured rates among all Texans. Texas has the second-highest rate of uninsured young children, behind Alaska. Nationally, more than 1 million children under the age of 6, or 4.3%, lack health insurance. About 19% of the country’s uninsured young children are in Texas, even though the state’s share of the nation’s population of young children is about half that percentage.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The population of Washington County has risen more than 30% since 2010 – adding 42,435 people – making it the county with the most rapid rate of growth in the state, according to a new report from the University of Utah. The university’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute based its analysis on census data, tracking Utah’s population growth since 2010. Other parts of the state, like Utah County, saw higher numbers of population growth, but not as high of a rate increase. All counties in the state are projected to grow over the next 50 years. The institute has predicted Washington County would grow to more than 500,000 residents by 2065, a 229% increase over the next 50 years. The county is projected to become the fourth-most-populous county in the state, beating out Weber County, according to the report.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: City officials say they hope the ice rink on the Statehouse lawn will be open for the holidays. The Times Argus reports that preparations for installing the rink have been underway this week. A newly designed rink opened last year after complaints about the wooden railing around a previous rink. Assistant City Manager Cameron Niedermayer said she expected the preparations to be completed by the end of the week. She said the rink will then be filled with water. When it opens to the public depends on when the water freezes. The rink will be open seven days a week and have motion-activated lighting to allow for night skating. The new rink was funded last year by a $15,000 state recreation grant, $25,000 from the Montpelier Recreation Department and a pledge from the National Life Group.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is pushing for tuition-free community college for low- and middle-income students who pursue degrees in high-demand fields. Northam announced Thursday that his budget proposal for the upcoming legislative session includes $145 million for the initiative. Northam calls the program his “G3” initiative, which stands for “Get Skilled. Get a Job. Give Back.” He campaigned heavily on the idea when he ran for governor in 2017. The plan targets industries that include health care and information technology. Passing a two-year state spending plan will be a top priority for the General Assembly during the 2020 session. During last month’s legislative elections, voters gave Democrats full control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation. The governor is expected to share full details of his budget plan next week.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has unanimously approved a $34 million contribution to a new Ocean Pavilion at the Seattle Aquarium, which could cost up to $120 million total. KOMO reports the new pavilion would include a giant, glass-bottomed shark tank at the entrance to greet visitors and and people who pass by. The aquarium describes the new 48,000-square-foot exhibit like a giant martini glass with up to five different species of sharks from the Coral Triangle, an area in the Pacific Ocean near Indonesia with endangered sea life. The 325,000-gallon tank and exhibit to be known as the Coral Canyon will be filled with big sharks, big sting rays and other sea life – all to draw attention to endangered sea life.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: Visitor center hours have changed for the season at New River Gorge National River, the National Park Service says. Sandstone Visitor Center was closed Monday and will remain closed through the spring. Canyon Rim Visitor Center in Lansing will remain open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but will be closed on Christmas and New Year’s Day. All other park facilities are open through the winter, including campgrounds, parking lots, boat launches, roads and most trails, the park said in a news release. The park is normally open 24 hours a day, but some areas may be closed temporarily due to hazardous conditions such as snow or ice. Long-term and most temporary closures are posted on the park’s webpage under “Alerts,” or on social media platforms.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Tiny bubbles will get the beer festival treatment at All Fizzed Up, the state’s first hard seltzer event, March 28 at Turner Hall Ballroom. At least 25 hard seltzer companies will be represented, and hard seltzer enthusiasts will be able to sample more than 100 flavor varieties. In addition to sipping, All Fizzed Up will have food available for purchase. A DJ will spin music while you sip. Handcrafted cocktails, assorted wines, beers and ciders also will be available. VIP tickets are $65.50 and include admission one hour earlier, along with 15 3-ounce sample tickets. General admission tickets cost $45.50 with 7:30 p.m. admission. General admission tickets include 10 3-ounce sample tickets. Attendees also receive a commemorative pint glass and keepsake photo.\n\nWyoming\n\nDaniel: Two sheriff’s deputies channeled their inner cowboy and lassoed a deer flailing in a frigid pond after it fell through thin ice, authorities said Wednesday. Sublette County sheriff’s Deputies Justin Hays and Joshua Peterson responded to a report Tuesday afternoon that a deer had fallen into a pond near the small ranching town of Daniel in southwestern Wyoming. Because the ice was too thin to walk on, they lassoed the deer and pulled it to shore. They left the deer on a nearby driveway where it could warm up, and it was gone a few hours later, sheriff’s officials said. Peterson stood at one end of the pond with a lasso and drove the deer toward Hays at the other end, Sgt. Travis Bingham said. Peterson’s body camera captured video of Hays as he swung the lasso around his head before looping it easily around the deer.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/08/state-cheese-awol-animals-editor-jailed-news-around-states/117415210/", "title": "State cheese, AWOL animals: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Legislative leaders are continuing to discuss prison construction and renovation alternatives, including whether pandemic relief funds can be used to offset costs or renovating and building prisons. Key lawmakers say they expect to continue discussions this month in advance of a possible special session later in the year. “I think the House and Senate are pretty close to an agreement,” said Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House General Fund budget committee. “The vast majority of legislators want to move forward with a bond proposal and for us to own the prisons.” Clouse and Sen. Greg Albritton, chairman of the Senate General Fund budget committee, said a topic under discussion is whether federal funds from the American Rescue Plan may be used to offset some of the costs or do renovations. States can use that money for a wide range of uses to contend with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Albritton said the state is trying to get clarity on “what can we do with the recovery money.” Lawmakers are looking for more options after Gov. Kay Ivey’s plan to rent prisons, which would be run by the state but built and owned by private companies, fell apart because of financing concerns. However, federal officials have been clear that new facilities will not solve the state’s prison woes.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A wildfire burned close to a vacation destination Tuesday, but fire officials believed Chena Hot Springs Resort would be spared. “They’re pretty confident that they’re going to be able to defend the resort, based on the measures that we’ve set up and the personnel we have on scene,” said Tim Mowry, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Forestry. Firefighters were working to protect the resort, homes and recreational cabins in the area of interior Alaska about 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks. Flames were about 100 yards from the resort, where crews were spraying water on buildings, the agency said in a statement. Firefighters also conducted a back burn near a trail that leads to two yurts for viewing the northern lights in hopes it would help stop the fire from advancing toward the main buildings. Hoses and sprinklers also were set up at nearby homes and cabins. No structures in the Chena Hot Springs area had burned, fire officials said. Light showers that fell overnight weren’t enough to put out the fire, but the increased humidity was helping to slow its growth. The Fairbanks North Star Borough on Monday issued a voluntary evacuation order. Alaska State Troopers conducted a survey of homeowners and cabin users and found that about 30 people decided not to leave, along with resort owner Bernie Karl.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials in the city plan to ignore Arizona’s new “Second Amendment sanctuary” law that bars state and local governments from enforcing certain federal gun regulations, possibly setting up a court fight as a growing number of cities and counties in the United States declare themselves similar firearm havens. The move by Democratic Mayor Regina Romero and the City Council again puts Tucson and the Republican-led state at odds over how to regulate gun sales and use. The southern Arizona city has long tried to enforce gun laws stricter than the state’s, including mandating background checks for guns purchased on city property and destroying seized firearms. Over the years, those measures have been challenged after the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted laws barring the actions. The new action came after GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill in April declaring that Arizona is a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. It was partly a response to the election of President Joe Biden, who has vowed to enact tighter firearms regulations. In a growing movement, at least 1,200 local governments have declared themselves sanctuaries insulated from state and federal gun laws since 2018, when high-profile mass shootings prompted calls for stronger regulations. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force.\n\nArkansas\n\nBeebe: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys for George Floyd’s family on Tuesday mourned a white Arkansas teenager fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy, as they urged support across racial lines for efforts to reform police practices. Sharpton eulogized 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, who was shot and killed by a white Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy, Sgt. Michael Davis, during a traffic stop June 23 near Cabot, about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. The killing in the predominantly white community has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists such as Sharpton, who said concerns about police tactics aren’t just limited to the Black community. “The issue of policing is not about Black and white,” Sharpton told a packed auditorium at Beebe High School, where Brittain was a rising senior. “It’s about right and wrong.” Many attending the memorial wore jeans and shirts that read “Justice for Hunter.” Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week fired Davis for not turning on his body camera until after he had shot Brittain. Staley said the only footage police have is from the aftermath. Arkansas State Police are investigating Brittain’s death. Authorities have released few details about the shooting. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and was holding a jug of antifreeze when he was shot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill’s author said Tuesday. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January. The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. “Safe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery,” Wiener said. Currently the sites are illegal in the United States but legal in Canada. Wiener’s bill barely cleared the Senate in April. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would “establish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens.” The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it “is very much alive, albeit delayed.” Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths. His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo will begin vaccinating some of its animals against COVID-19 as early as next week. Zoologists say they have been working with the veterinary vaccine company Zoetis to receive doses for the animals, and primates and carnivores will be first on the list. The veterinary vaccine, which is formulated primarily for mammals, is being developed separate from the ones for human use. Transmission is rare between humans and other species, but there have been several documented cases of COVID-19 in large cats, monkeys and certain rodent populations. “We know some of those animals – like gorillas and tigers, mink, otters – can all be infected. But for a lot of these others, we don’t know what the susceptibility is,” Dr. Scott Larsen, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, told KMGH-TV. “For animals, we want to be able to protect them similar to (how) we’re trying to protect people.” Veterinary scientists do not think common house pets like cats or dogs are in significant danger of catching COVID-19. “There are 85 million dogs in the United States and 90 million cats,” said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary in Denver. “If we were going to see problems … I think we would be seeing it.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGuilford: The state’s newest climate change legislation should put it in a good position to receive millions of dollars in anticipated federal funds to help foot the bill for expensive resiliency projects needed across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials said Tuesday. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said the $30 million in bonding included in the new state budget to help municipalities identify and plan for such projects, including green infrastructure, will also give Connecticut a leg up on other states. “We’ll be shovel-ready. We’ll be at the front of the line,” Dykes said during a bill-signing event at a beach in Guilford. “It’s going to take a lot of dollars to help protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. And the best way to do that, dollars we really want to put to work, are federal dollars.” Curt Johnson, president of the environmental group Save the Sound, predicted Connecticut will receive $3 or $4 in federal funds for every $1 the state spends on these resiliency efforts. The new law gives all cities and towns, not just certain ones, the ability to establish stormwater authorities. Additionally, the law expands the duties of the 10-year-old Connecticut Green Bank, a first-in-the-nation entity.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two deadly species of hemlock have been found in Delaware, and the state’s Department of Agriculture is warning people to avoid plants that look like wild carrots to prevent the possibility of being poisoned. Environmental scientists confirmed that poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock were located in Sussex County wetlands, according to a news release from the agency. Both plants have small white flowers and bloom between June and August. Poison hemlock also grows in meadows, pastures and ditches. The invasive plant can reach between 6 and 8 feet tall and has a hairless stem with purple blotches. The department said this type of hemlock releases an odor but shouldn’t be crushed to smell because toxic oils can be emitted. Spotted water hemlock is a native plant and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its stems vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, and it has fern-like leaves. People who think they found either plant can email pictures to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification. The Agriculture Department said residents shouldn’t try to eradicate the hemlocks themselves and should instead find a licensed aquatic pest control company to treat them. It also advised against mowing the plants, which can release toxic particles into the air.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Parking in the nation’s capital is often a nightmare for residents and especially for their guests, but D.C. has launched an easier visitor parking pass program, WUSA-TV reports. When the visitor parking pass was launched in 2013, it was met with widespread opposition. With the new program, people can register for the annual pass allowing their guests to park for two hours in a residential permit parking zone in all eight wards. “The intent of the system is to make getting a visitor parking permit easier and also to reduce parking congestion in residential areas,” said Everett Lott, acting director for the District Department of Transportation. The new online parking portal now allows people to print out their own parking permits for visitors and can be accessed through the portal provided by D.C. online or through an app on Apple or Android phones. “This particular system, the automated system, is connected to the resident and to the license plate,” Lott said. “So it makes it a lot more user-friendly but also helps to eliminate any of the abuse that was possible in the past.” Parking permits, which must be displayed prominently on the windshield of vehicles, can be printed at home, at D.C. Public Library branches, or at kiosks at DDOT Headquarters, the DDOT Permit Office and Metropolitan Police Department precincts.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A couple is suing a Catholic school and demanding the return of a large donation, saying it isn’t adhering to Catholic values because of the way it’s handling issues like race and accepting the LGBTQ community. Anthony and Barbara Scarpo filed their lawsuit against the Academy of the Holy Names last month after one of their daughters graduated and a second transferred to another school, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The lawsuit comes four years after the couple pledged $1.35 million to the school, which named its theater for the family. The couple claims the school has “lost its way” by distancing itself from mainstream Catholicism and embracing a “woke culture” in which priority is given to “gender identity, human sexuality and pregnancy termination among other hot button issues.” The suit also takes issue with a blackboard in a common area that explains how to be an ally to the LGBTQ community, as well as how the school takes on the issue of race, saying white students are made to feel guilty. The Scarpos had paid $240,000 toward the pledge as of 2018, the lawsuit said. The school didn’t discuss details of the suit, but spokeswoman Emily Wise told the Times in an email that the school’s curriculum is based on Catholic values.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block some challenged sections of Georgia’s new election law ahead of two runoff elections next week, but he didn’t rule out the possibility for future elections. Election integrity activists had asked U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee to prohibit the state from enforcing sections of the new law that have to do with observation of elections, as well as a new deadline for requesting absentee ballots. Their request arose from one of eight federal lawsuits challenging the new law. The Republican-backed overhaul of election rules enacted this year has been blasted by Democrats and others who say it creates unnecessary obstacles to voting, particularly for people of color. Most of the lawsuits, including one filed last month by the U.S. Department of Justice, challenge the parts of law that critics say threaten voting rights. The targeted request that led to Wednesday’s ruling, though, focused on provisions mostly related to monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The activists, led by the Coalition for Good Governance, said those sections criminalize normal election observation activities and could intimidate voters, election observers and members of the news media. A tighter absentee ballot request deadline makes it virtually impossible to get one for a runoff, they argue.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers on Tuesday overrode Gov. David Ige’s veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax on hotel stays and other short-term rentals. Instead, lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. Further, instead of providing the state’s four major counties with a share of transient accommodations tax revenue, the legislation gives the counties the authority to levy their own surcharge to the tax. Currently, the state charges one uniform hotel tax rate across the islands. Sen. Bennette Misalucha, vice chair of the Senate’s Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism Committee, said special funds shouldn’t be protected for the benefit of one industry. She said the Legislature brought special funds like hotel tax revenue into the general fund to stop this practice. The Hawaii Tourism Authority will now be required to get support from lawmakers for its budget just like other state agencies, she said, which will require the agency to be more forthcoming with its strategic plans and force more communication between the agency and lawmakers.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: High housing prices in northern Idaho are making it difficult to attract police officers, law enforcement officials say. Coeur d’Alene Police Capt. Dave Hagar told the Coeur d’Alene Press that low crime rates and an outdoor lifestyle are big draws but that skyrocketing housing prices are turning people away. “Five years ago, the cost of living in Coeur d’Alene was much more reasonable,” Hagar said. “Now it’s gone above that.” The Coeur d’Alene Association of Realtors said the median residential home sale price was $476,000 in March. That’s a 47% increase from a year ago. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said his agency has recruited new hires only to have them decline the job after discovering they couldn’t afford housing. “It’s a significant barrier,” he said. “The housing situation is severe.” The agency is looking to hire deputies, dispatchers, control room operators, clerks and jail staff. “We’re going to have to attract local candidates,” Norris said. “We can’t do that when some of our pay is $14 or $15 an hour.” Kootenai County Commissioner Bill Brooks said other county agencies are also having a hard time finding and retaining workers. Wages once considered normal are now not enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s schools will encourage student COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the start of the school year with school-based vaccination sites and events, officials announced Wednesday. Officials with the nation’s third-largest school district plan to offer full in-person instruction in the fall and want to vaccinate as many students as possible before classes begin next month. District officials said they are “not in a position” to mandate COVID-19 shots but will ask families to submit COVID-19 vaccine documents, as is the practice with other immunizations. Starting next week, the district will offer vaccines at three school sites for students and their families. The sites will be able to administer 600 doses weekly. The district is also working with hospitals for events in areas with low inoculation rates and offering the shots at back-to-school events. “Schools are trusted pillars of our communities, and as a district we are uniquely suited to help expand vaccination opportunities, which helps create the safest possible learning environments at our schools,” said Jose M. Torres, interim schools CEO. More than 50,000 children under the age of 18 have already been vaccinated in Chicago, according to the city’s Department of Public Health. Roughly 350,000 students attend Chicago Public Schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As federal officials debate pouring billions of dollars into broadband access, data suggests many of Indiana’s schoolchildren and adults who preferred to work from home spent the pandemic with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s least-wealthy counties. In about half of Indiana’s counties – 47 of 92 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 79% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 47 of 92 counties – no more than 22% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of Senate moderates have reached a deal on a far-reaching infrastructure plan that would direct $65 billion to increase broadband connectivity from coast to coast. Despite the agreement, it’s unclear whether it would address the solutions some lawmakers want to see such as continued broadband subsidies for low-income families, greater competition among wireless providers, and continued buildout of high-speed networks in poorer, rural areas. In Indiana, 12.4% of residents don’t have adequate broadband infrastructure, and 48.4% live in areas with only one internet provider, according to the White House.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A teenager injured in an accident on an amusement ride that killed his younger brother remained on life support Wednesday as he turned 16, his family pastor said. David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children’s Hospital since Saturday’s accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said. David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said. The pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids said it’s a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church, which planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night, is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000. Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David’s birthday, but “there won’t be a lot of celebrating,” Shields said. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland on Saturday to celebrate David’s upcoming birthday. The junior at Linn-Mar High School had been excited about getting his driver’s license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has expanded the paid leave that state employees can take from their jobs when they become parents or act as caregivers. Kelly issued an executive order Tuesday that provides an extra two weeks of paid leave for state workers who are a child’s primary caregiver and an extra week for secondary caregivers. The order also makes foster parents eligible for the same paid leave. Primary caregivers will now receive up to eight weeks of paid leave, rather than six. Secondary caregivers will receive four weeks instead of three. The order directed the state Department of Administration to put the new policies into effect immediately. Kelly said the state is demonstrating a commitment to recruiting and keeping talented workers and creating a “supportive environment for our families.” “Supporting working parents in our workforce is not only the right thing to do,” Kelly said in a statement. “It’s good for our economy.” The order also says new state employees become eligible for paid leave after 180 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: After years of planning and public input, the construction phase of the Sherman Minton Bridge rehabilitation project will soon be underway. The Sherman Minton Renewal project team said Tuesday that it will begin working on ramp improvements next week. The improvements “are being made to prepare for the first phase of the rehabilitation, which will include the first half of eastbound construction on the lower deck and painting of the bridge trusses,” according to a news release. According to the team, ramp shoulders at the Interstates 65 and 265 interchange, as well as the Interstates 64 and 265 interchange, will be modified to accommodate additional traffic. The modification process will take one to two weeks, the team said, and “will require nighttime lane closures and/or ramp closures to construct.” After the ramp improvements are completed, traffic will be reduced to two lanes in each direction as the team works on painting and deck replacement preparations. When lanes are restricted, I-65 and I-265 will serve as a detour route, the team said. The Sherman Minton, which spans the Ohio River to connect the Bluegrass and Hoosier states, is 59 years old. The proposal to rehabilitate the double-decker bridge was announced in 2018. The price tag for the project is roughly $137 million.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities say they’ve been searching for a 12-foot python that escaped from its enclosure inside the state’s largest shopping mall. Cara, a yellow and white Burmese python, slithered out of its enclosure at the Blue Zoo in the Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, news outlets report. She was still on the loose early Wednesday morning, WBRZ-TV reports, after a search overnight, when such snakes are most active. “While we’ve created a very secure home for Cara, our Burmese Python, she has slithered out of her exhibit,” the Blue Zoo said in a statement. “Cara is a non-poisonous, friendly snake that enjoys her time interacting with guests during our Snake Education Shows.” Pythons slowly squeeze their prey to death before swallowing them. Cara was described as “very sweet” by her handlers, who released a photo of the animal. The Blue Zoo – which bills itself as “more than an aquarium, more than a zoo” – was closed Tuesday while search efforts continued, but the Mall of Louisiana remained open.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Enrollment in public schools across the state dropped by 4.4%, nearly 8,000 students, between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, according to Maine Department of Education data. Most of those students transitioned to home schooling, which saw an increase of 5,000 students, according to department data. School systems expect many students to return for the 2021-22 school year, Bangor Daily News reports. According to an Education Week report, Maine had the fourth-highest decrease in the nation behind Vermont’s 5.3% decrease, Mississippi’s 5% drop and New Hampshire’s 4.7% decline. Steve Bailey, executive director at Maine School Management Association, said the change reflects concerns from parents about safety during the pandemic and child care challenges. The most significant decrease was in prekindergarten and kindergarten students, for whom the population decreased by 16%, compared to a 3% decrease in all other students.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: Teenagers will be entered to win $50,000 college scholarships if they get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state’s latest incentive program offered to encourage as many people as possible to get the shots. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the new lottery program Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. Twenty Marylanders between the ages of 12 and 17 will win scholarships worth $50,000 each between now and Labor Day. The program will give away a total of $1 million in scholarships or the equivalent of full tuition and fees at one of Maryland’s public universities. Winners who choose to attend college out of state can transfer the scholarship to the school of their choice, Hogan said. The program will begin Monday and continue through Labor Day. Teens who have been vaccinated in Maryland are eligible and will be automatically entered, the governor said. Winners will be chosen using the same process as “VaxCash,” a lottery for adults that recently ended. That program awarded a total of $2 million in prizes to Marylanders 18 and older who had received a COVID-19 vaccine at any time. The scholarship prizes will be deposited into college savings accounts with Maryland 529.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nTopsfield: A more than 200-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is scheduled to return this fall, organizers announced Wednesday. The 11-day Topsfield Fair, first held in 1818, will start Oct. 1, the Essex Agricultural Society said in a statement. “Having to cancel last year’s Topsfield Fair due to the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating,” General Manager James O’Brien said. “We are thrilled to announce that the fair will return this year with no restrictions, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the fairgrounds in October.” The fair was previously canceled for three years during World War II and in 1918 because of an influenza pandemic. Based on attendance in 1946 after the three-year shutdown, O’Brien said he expects high attendance this fall. In anticipation, fair personnel have installed extra sinks and hand-sanitizing stations around the fairgrounds north of Boston, he said. One of the fair’s most popular events is the giant pumpkin contest, but it also includes livestock exhibits, a midway, vendors, food stalls and live music. It typically draws up to 500,000 visitors per year. A schedule for concerts, which are free with fair admission, will be announced soon.\n\nMichigan\n\nRoseville: CARE of Southeastern Michigan is hosting a free, two-week day camp for kids whose family members struggle with addiction. Open for children in preschool through eighth grade, Camp CARE will address communicating effectively, managing emotions, dealing with change, choosing friends wisely, resisting peer pressure and more. The skills are taught through hands-on activities like arts, crafts and games, said CARE director of substance use prevention Kaitlin Maloziec. The Roseville fire and police departments will also visit the camp for a teaching segment in the city about 15 miles northeast of Detroit. “It’s just a spot where kids can be kids, make friendships and see that they’re not alone,” Maloziec said. The camp will be held at Fountain Elementary in Roseville from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 19-23 and July 26-30. Zoom sessions for parents and caregivers will teach adults some of the same skills as the youth, along with parenting tips and advice on how to talk about addiction and address kids’ questions. The camp, which Maloziec said has been around for more than two decades, is hosting up to 60 students this year. Most activities will be held outdoors, with mask-wearing required and lunch provided. Registration is available online and closes at 11:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: With COVID-19 limits fading away, tourists are returning to Minnesota resorts, many of them from neighboring states. But a lot of employees are not coming back. The worker shortage has been building for more than a year, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for Hospitality Minnesota, the trade association for the state’s hotels, restaurants, resorts and campgrounds. The industry is down about 50,000 workers from its normal summer level of 280,000 to 290,000 workers. Many of them found other jobs during the first COVID-19 shutdown, and others left when a second hospitality shutdown was ordered, the Star Tribune reports. “After last year, we were hopeful that things would get back to normal,” said Sue Dutcher, manager of the St. Croix River Resort in Hinckley. Instead, “we’re being run ragged.” In Detroit Lakes, Joanne Anderson faces a similar challenge at the Forest Hills Resort. Anderson manages Izzo’s, the resort’s bar and restaurant, and is running it with eight workers instead of the usual 20. Some operators have been fortunate enough to escape the labor shortage. The Trail Center Lodge on the Gunflint Trail is “100% staffed,” according to owner Sarah Hamilton. That’s partly due to a new program that brings young adults from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to work at businesses on the North Shore.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Farmers in the state are losing the catfish wars against their foreign competitors with the very weapon they saw as their salvation. The domestic catfish industry, along with lawmakers including the late U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, lobbied to move oversight of catfish processing from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture five years ago with the expectation the USDA’s stricter eye would limit the foreign imports that had decimated domestic production throughout the Mississippi Delta. Instead, imports of siluriformes – the larger category of catfish and catfish-like fish sometimes referred to by their family name, “pangasius” – have only increased since the switch to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2016. Meanwhile, domestic prices and production, mainly in Mississippi and other Southern states, have continued to decline. Almost 65,000 additional tons of catfish were imported in 2019 compared to 2015 before the Food Safety and Inspection Service took over, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service. The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce lists recent processing volumes at 5 million pounds per month less than in 2015 during FDA oversight.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Seventeen more people in southwest Missouri died from COVID-19 in a two-week period ending Sunday as the coronavirus continues to surge in the region, officials said. The deaths were recorded in the two-week reporting period from June 21 to July 4 and were disclosed Tuesday by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, the Kansas City Star reports. The dead ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and none of those who died was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday told reporters that his administration has done “everything possible” to fend off outbreaks. Missouri has reported nearly 530,000 cases of the virus and 9,375 deaths since the pandemic began. The state has administered more than 5 million doses, with 44.9% of the population getting at least one. Parson said he’s focused on encouraging people to get inoculated and making the shots available to them. He said he’s still wary of incentivizing vaccinations with prizes. “Right now, the vaccine’s out there,” Parson said. “I mean, people walk past it every day, whether they’re in a pharmacy, whether they’re in a Walmart, whether they’re in a health center.” Parson also on Wednesday signed a bill into law to limit lawsuits against companies for wrongdoing related to the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Wildlife officials were searching by ground and from the air Wednesday for a grizzly bear that killed a woman who was camping. A helicopter was flying over the area around the small town of Ovando, in western Montana, in pursuit of the bear, which will be killed if found, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon said. Large traps made out of culverts were set around the area in hopes of capturing the bruin. Ovando, about 60 miles northwest of Helena, is a community of fewer than 100 people at the edge of the sprawling Bob Marshall wilderness. Long-distance bicyclists such as the victim often spend the night in the town. Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said the bear wandered into the victim’s camping area a couple of times before Tuesday’s fatal mauling. Someone at the scene used bear spray, and other campers called 911, Roselles said. Roselles closed down any camping in Ovando as the search for the bear continued, following creeks leading away from the town. Further circumstances surrounding the attack were under investigation. Officials said their priority was to find and kill the bear to prevent another dangerous encounter.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: A tomahawk once owned by Chief Standing Bear, a pioneering Native American civil rights leader, is returning to his Nebraska tribe after decades in a museum at Harvard. The university’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology said it’s been working with members of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska and Oklahoma to repatriate the artifact. Larry Wright Jr., chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said Tuesday that the return of the historic weapon is a powerful symbol of homecoming for the tribe, which was among many forcibly relocated from their homelands to other territories by the federal government in the 1800s. Standing Bear was arrested 1878 for leaving the tribe’s reservation in order to fulfill a promise he made to bury his eldest son back in their tribe’s homeland in the Niobrara River Valley. In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law. “That hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,” Standing Bear famously said in court. “The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.” Wright said the tribe is preparing its own museum, located near Standing Bear’s grave, to properly display the tomahawk and other artifacts.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A 110-acre property at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip has been purchased to be the site for a terminal station for a planned new high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. Brightline Holdings announced the purchase Tuesday without announcing the price, but local news outlets report that Clark County records indicate the purchase by the holding company for Brightline West closed Thursday for $140 million. The site is on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard across from Premium Outlets South mall and near McCarran International Airport. Company officials have said Brightline West trains would carry up to 500 passengers at speeds up to 200 mph on the planned route between Las Vegas and Victorville, California. The project has been delayed over the years, most recently because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Plans to close the state’s youth detention center are quickly taking shape, with a consultant due to submit a preliminary report in the next two weeks. The two-year state budget Gov. Chris Sununu signed June 25 includes a mandate to close the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester by March 2023. But the state Department of Health and Human Services didn’t wait for lawmakers and the governor to act; it signed a $55,000 contract with Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services of Washington, D.C., on June 8. The contract, paid for with federal pandemic aid, requires the consultants to deliver a draft closure plan by mid-July and a final report by August. According to details submitted to the governor’s Executive Council last week, the department didn’t have time to solicit bids given the time-sensitive work but consulted with stakeholders before hiring the firm. Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette told the council she met with advocates for juvenile justice, including the Disability Rights Center and the Office of the Child Advocate. “We have this opportunity to build the right-sized program on a clinical model instead of a detention model. So I brought the advocates together to say, ‘What is your ideal model?’ ” she said. “They said they weren’t qualified and that I should hire a consultant. So that is what I did.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater: The pandemic that closed restaurant dining rooms last year also put a stop to food tours. But with eateries up and running again, food tours are starting back up, too, inviting food lovers to explore a town by enjoying its restaurants’ signature dishes and learning about local history. “For the first time in 15 months, we are opening public tours again, and it is really exciting,” said Alessia Aron, owner of Beyond the Plate Tours, which presents excursions in Jersey City, Red Bank and Somerville. Local restaurants “have been through hell and back, and we are just trying to support them as much as possible.” Her company, previously Jersey Girls Food Tours, is one of seven that comprise the NJ Food Tour Trail. “We thought that coming together and creating the New Jersey Food Tour Trail would help us come out of the pandemic better,” said Audrey Wiggins, owner of On the Town Food Tours, another participant. “July 1 is our official opening date for all tour companies; some have started a little earlier than that, but everyone is now officially open.” Other NJ Food Tour Trail companies include Asbury Park Food Tours, Cape May Food Tours, Sister Cities Food and Shop Tours, Savor and Stroll Culinary Tours and Have You Met Newark Tours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new podcast called Parks urges visitors to America’s national parks to educate themselves about and acknowledge the Indigenous tribes whose ties to these sacred spaces span millennia. The aim of the documentary podcast is to explore the history of tribes on these lands, the ways in which the lands were dispossessed, issues the Indigenous communities face today, and how they’ve kept their culture and traditions alive, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “There’s so much that was written, but when it was written, it was from the point of view of Eastern colonizers,” said Mary Mathis, 25, a former photo editor at National Public Radio and Outside magazine who serves as the host of Parks, co-created with fellow Santa Fe-based multimedia journalist Cody Nelson. “It wasn’t every story, it was just one story – the quote-unquote ‘winner’s’ story. We see that a lot in our education system, and I think that was where the idea (for Parks) kind of came from.” The first episode follows a format the Parks team plans to replicate throughout the project, one in which Indigenous guests are closely involved in each step of the editing process so as to maintain complete ownership of their stories.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A consortium of businesses and nonprofits will run Central Park’s Wollman ice rink, one of four recreational concessions that were operated by Donald Trump’s company until the city canceled its contracts with the former president, the city Department of Parks and Recreation announced Tuesday. A joint venture called Wollman Park Partners LLC is expected to be awarded a five-year contract to run the rink after submitting the winning bid for the project, city officials said. The joint venture, which includes Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, Related Companies, Equinox, caterer Great Performances and local groups such as Ice Hockey in Harlem, will reinvest all profits into upgrading the rink, city officials said. “It’s the Summer of New York City, but we’re already preparing for an iconic winter, too,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release. “I’m thrilled that NYC Parks has found a quality operator for Wollman Rink that is committed to reinvesting in the community and creating a welcoming space for all New Yorkers.” The Democrat announced in January that the city would terminate business contracts with the Trump Organization over Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The cancellations affected a golf course in the Bronx and a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Superior Court judge put a small-town newspaper editor behind bars last month after one of his reporters used an audio recorder for note-taking purposes at a murder trial – a punishment the paper and media rights groups consider excessive. Judge Stephan Futrell sentenced Gavin Stone, the news editor of the Richmond County Daily Journal, to five days in jail before having the editor hauled off to jail. Stone was released the next day but still faces the possibility of more time in lockup. Brian Bloom, the paper’s publisher, acknowledged that his reporter shouldn’t have had the recorder in court because it was not allowed but criticized the judge’s move to imprison an editor for a minor infraction committed by a colleague. “The penalty does not fit the crime,” he said. “Let’s put this in perspective: You stop a murder trial not once, but twice, because a guy had a tape recorder sitting next to him on a bench at a courtroom. Let’s put our priorities in place here.” Futrell did not respond to a request for comment. Superior Court rules allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings but grant judges the authority to prohibit the technology.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: The Mandan City Commission has agreed to equip the community’s police force with body cameras. The commission approved the cameras unanimously Tuesday with no discussion. The police department received a quote from Digital-Ally, which already has cameras inside the police vehicles. A memo from police to commissioners said that using the same company for the cameras will allow for better integration of the equipment, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The package of 28 body cameras, upgraded in-car cameras, accessories, set-up, training and cloud storage would cost about $165,000 for a five-year subscription. The police department also received approval to request funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to offset the cost of the cameras. It is asking for nearly $37,000 over five years, according to the memo. The Lincoln Police Department began using body cameras in early 2020. The Bismarck Police Department and the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Department do not use the technology.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The top prosecutor in one of the state’s most populous counties has decided his office will no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters announced his decision Tuesday, saying it would take effect immediately. “It’s time for this nonsense to end,” Deters said. The directive comes in the wake of a violent holiday weekend in Cincinnati. Among the incidents was a Fourth of July shooting at a downtown park where authorities say a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy opened fire on each other, leaving both of them dead and three innocent bystanders wounded. Hundreds of teens were gathered at Smale Park when the shooting occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Sunday, authorities say. At the time, police officers were working to clear out the riverfront park before its closing time. “People must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” Deters said. “No amount of money can fix the problems we are facing. Parents must parent their children. Communities must speak up.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s office announced Wednesday that he requested $4 million in federal funds to help combat illegal marijuana growing operations in the state. Inhofe’s chief of staff, Luke Holland, announced the request during an Oklahoma Sheriffs Association meeting, saying Inhofe requested a direct appropriation through the U.S. Justice Department to allow the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to establish a unit to combat “transnational and national drug organizations.” The unit would work with sheriffs to combat illegal drug operations. Medical marijuana is a booming business in Oklahoma, where voters in 2018 approved one of the nation’s most liberal medical programs. As a result, out-of-state weed entrepreneurs have flocked to the state to get involved. But sheriffs and other law enforcement groups, which opposed the state question in 2018, have said illegal marijuana grow operations are setting up in rural parts of Oklahoma and funneling cannabis into the illegal drug trade in Oklahoma and other states.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon said Tuesday that it will start the second phase of building the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact after receiving another $500million donation for the project. Construction on the first phase of the new campus started in 2016 – after the first half-billion-dollar gift from the Nike co-founder and his wife – with a large science building including a pedestrian bridge over the street. A second building for “bioengineering and applied science research building to support expanded research programs and facilities” will be built next, according to a university news release. The building is planned to cover 175,000 square feet, with multiple stories, and be located north of the first building. The focus of the new campus is to translate scientific discoveries into advances in health care and other fields. The latest money will also pay for 14 to 16 additional faculty members and their teams. The new campus currently employs 13 tenure-related faculty members and their research teams, for a total of about 90 employees. “The aim of the new campus is to compress the timeline between discovery and “societal impact,” said Robert Guldberg, vice president and executive director of the new science operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will rise another 5% in January, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday. The agency board voted to impose the higher rates as of Jan. 2. The most common E-ZPass fare for a passenger vehicle will rise by a dime, from $1.60 to $1.70. Those being charged through a scan of their license plate will see the most common fare go from $3.90 to $4.10. The most common truck fare will go from $13 to $13.70 for E-ZPass and from $26.60 to $28 for toll-by-plate. Officials say 2022 will be the first time in six years that fares will have jumped by less than 6%. The turnpike has pumped more than $7 billion in funding from tolls to the state Transportation Department since 2007.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Almost $54 million worth of fraudulent unemployment claims have been filed during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials say. The latest total is about $9 million more than in May, with even more victims coming forward in the past month, according to WJAR-TV. State Department of Labor and Training Director Matt Weldon said that doesn’t necessarily mean the claims were filed during that time span, just that they are coming to light now. The agency has managed to get back about $3.75 million so far with the help of federal agencies, but Weldon said he believes that will grow significantly in the coming months. The agency is also enforcing rules that require people to look for work while collecting benefits, he said. With 64,000 Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits, that will be a slow process, with the agency only able to get through a few hundred claims per week to start, he said. “As you can imagine, trying to audit claims and go through information is difficult when there are more than a workable number, so we are going to begin with hundreds and see how that goes, and then that can grow in the future,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants a new abortion law to take effect, arguing Wednesday that a judge’s decision to put the whole measure – and not just the parts being challenged in court – on hold during a lawsuit “oversteps the bounds of federal judicial power.” Gov. Henry McMaster’s brief with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asks appellate judges to lift a lower court’s injunction on the South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act. The Republican signed the measure into law earlier this year that requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If cardiac activity is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from going into effect during the litigation. In his brief, attorneys for McMaster argued that decision represents “overreaching federal power to interfere with state law.” McMaster, along with other defendants including state Attorney General Alan Wilson, also argue that the groups that sued don’t have proper standing to challenge the law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMadison: An increasing number of primarily social media complaints from residents in Madison and Lake County have brought to light a little-known county ordinance banning people from occupying their campers or recreational vehicles outside the confines of a campground. Lake County Planning and Zoning Officer Mandi Anderson said the ordinance has gone undetected for many years until a recent barrage of postings that have led to heated debate among residents. Some who are opposed to the rule say that it infringes on property rights and that there should be nothing wrong with letting visitors use a camper for a short time. “I didn’t realize it was this out of hand,” Anderson said. One theory for the ordinance, Anderson said, is that people who construct large lakeside homes on small lots do not want to be inundated with noise from adjoining property when three campers pull in for the weekend and 50 people take up temporary residence, The Madison Daily Leader reports. Anderson said citations are only issued if the matter is not addressed after the property owner has been notified about the ordinance and has been given an opportunity to comply. She emphasized she does not drive around looking for violators but only responds to complaints.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are inviting the public to celebrate and remember civil rights icon John Lewis in a dedication ceremony next week. Earlier this year, Nashville’s Metro Council renamed a large portion of Fifth Avenue North to Rep. John Lewis Way. Councilwoman Zulfat Suara submitted the request last year, focusing on Lewis’ work to desegregate Nashville’s lunch counters before becoming a long-serving congressman in Georgia. The city will host a dedication July 16-17. The event was originally scheduled for February but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As a college student at American Baptist College and then Fisk University, Lewis helped desegregate public spaces in Nashville and pushed for racial justice across the South. Lewis was a Freedom Rider, spoke at the March on Washington, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Lewis died July 17, 2020. He was 80.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Air Force is mostly responsible for a former serviceman killing more than two dozen people at a church in 2017 because it failed to submit his criminal history into a database, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms. U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez in San Antonio wrote in a ruling signed Wednesday that the Air Force was “60% responsible” for the massacre at First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, where Devin Kelley opened fire during a Sunday service. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. The attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history. “The trial conclusively established that no other individual – not even Kelley’s own parents or partners – knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,” Rodriguez wrote. Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child’s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers and from possessing body armor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hospital leaders renewed their pleas for people to get vaccinated Wednesday as the state experiences another surge in new coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant. That strain has begun to surge in Utah over the past month and now represents about 80% of cases in the state, said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the state health department. Utah has averaged about 386 confirmed cases per day over the past week, nearly double the case rate the state was experiencing at its lowest point in early June. The surge is largely occurring in unvaccinated people who are being infected and hospitalized at six times the rate of vaccinated people, Hoffman said. “The frustrating part about all of this is that, unlike last year, we have all the tools to stop this pandemic in its tracks,” Hoffman told reporters during a virtual briefing. “The COVID-19 vaccines work.” Utah now ranks fourth in the nation for new cases per capita, and the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 31% over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Utah met health officials’ goal of vaccinating 70% of adults and 25% of children ages 12 to 15 with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, but hospital leaders say more people need to be vaccinated to avoid hospitals from being overrun again.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The FIS Ski World Cup will be returning to the Killington Ski Resort this November. Over the years the event has drawn tens of thousands of people to the town on Thanksgiving weekend. It was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort & Pico Mountain, said in a news release that in addition to skiing, there will be a full weekend of activities, including live music. Joshua Eckler, owner of Trailside Inn, told the Rutland Herald he thinks this will be a big year for the World Cup, given the past 14 months of travel restrictions. “We try to encourage a lot of guests to come for it even if they’re not ski racing fans because it’s more of an experience,” Eckler said. “You don’t have to be a die-hard racing fan to enjoy the event, just because of the music and the atmosphere and the excitement – everybody is screaming for everybody.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Workers removed a statue of Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former governor, U.S. senator and staunch segregationist, from the state’s Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal, and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state’s most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state’s racist “massive resistance” policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a years­long movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state’s public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone’s throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd’s “devotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.” Byrd’s son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.\n\nWashington\n\nRichland: A new state report finds that more than 57% of Hanford Nuclear Reservation workers reported exposure to hazardous material on the former nuclear weapons production site in south-central Washington state. The Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board recently released its final report and recommendations on the unmet health care needs of Hanford workers. The report’s central recommendation calls for creation of a new, independent Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Center. It would provide a centralized clearinghouse for dissemination of accepted scientific literature. Important functions would also include evaluation and communication of newly available studies about Hanford-specific hazards. For incurable diseases such as chronic beryllium disease, information sharing could be key to finding cures. Additionally, the center would promote research to increase the body of knowledge for the Hanford workforce. Hanford for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, and thousands of workers are now tasked with cleaning up the nation’s largest volume of radioactive wastes. “The working families that make up the Hanford community represent a very unique population, with occupational risks not easily quantified or identified,” said Nickolas A. Bumpaous, Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board co-chair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Traffic on the West Virginia Turnpike around the Fourth of July weekend was the heaviest since 2010. The turnpike saw 668,000 vehicles pass through its toll booths between Thursday and Monday, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release Tuesday. That’s 28% higher than for the five-day period a year ago, when travel was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “It was a huge Fourth of July period,” said West Virginia Parkways Authority executive director Jeff Miller. “People are just ready to get out and travel.” Miller said many travelers started trips the weekend before the Fourth of July and returned home the weekend after. Between June 27 and Monday, more than 1.12 million vehicles went through the turnpike’s toll booths, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: In a cheese-obsessed state that proudly touts itself as America’s Dairyland, the dairy cow is the official domestic animal, milk is the official state beverage, and cheese is the official dairy product. But even though Wisconsin produces more cheese than any other state at 3.4 billion pounds each year, there is no official state cheese. A bipartisan bill heard by a state Assembly committee on Wednesday would change that. The measure makes colby, which was created in Wisconsin more than 100 years ago, the official cheese. Colby may be as “gouda” choice as any, but the choice threatens to turn fans of cheddar, swiss, provolone and other varieties red, or perhaps blue, in the face with rage. Colby also holds a special place in Wisconsin cheese history. It was created in the central Wisconsin city of Colby in 1885 by Joseph Steinwand, who named it after the township where his father built northern Clark County’s first cheese factory, according to a state historical marker in the city, located about 40 miles west of Wausau. Colby isn’t the most-produced cheese in Wisconsin. Mozzarella is tops, followed by cheddar and some Italian varieties, according to the USDA. Still, more than 45 million pounds of colby are produced at Wisconsin’s 150 cheese plants each year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first female federal district judge plans to semi-retire in 2022, opening the way for Democratic President Joe Biden to nominate a judge in the deeply Republican state. Going on senior status will give U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal in Cheyenne more control over the number and type of cases she oversees. She plans to spend more of her free time with her husband, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, and grandchildren, Freudenthal told the Casper Star-Tribune. She hasn’t decided yet how she will use her time as judge but might stop taking new criminal cases to provide freedom from speedy trial requirements, she said. Freudenthal had no experience with criminal cases before becoming a federal district judge in 2010. She has found those cases the most rewarding because they can be life-changing for convicts, Freudenthal said. “Yes, their lives going forward will still be very challenging, but they have the opportunity to rebuild that life, take advantage of resources, hopefully live a life of sobriety,” she said. Freudenthal, 67, holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. She was an attorney in the offices of Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan from 1980 to 1989.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/04/best-cities-live-every-state-us-quality-life/38833209/", "title": "Best cities to live in every state in the US for quality of life", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated the geographical location of Waynesboro, Virginia.\n\nThere are nearly 20,000 villages, towns and cities across the 50 states, and not all of them are equally conducive to the well-being of those who live there.\n\nWhile quality of life is subject to a range of factors – close relationships and personal health being among the most important – the local community and environment can also have a meaningful impact.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a place to call home, everyone has their own priorities and subjective tastes.

This is no coincidence, as close proximity to a major city provides residents with access to more job opportunities, which in turn can help lower unemployment and improve financial security.\n\nThe best cities to live in include ones just outside of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Oklahoma City, Pittsburgh and Washington.\n\n1. Valley, Alabama\n\n• Population: 9,439\n\n• 5 yr. population change: -0.8 percent\n\n• Median home value: $82,900\n\n• Median household income: $39,387\n\nThe majority of the cities on this list are relatively wealthy. Valley, Alabama, is an exception. The typical household in Valley earns just $39,387 a year, about $5,000 less than the typical Alabama household. Still, serious financial hardship is less common in Valley than in Alabama as a whole as 15.7 percent of area residents live below the poverty line, well below the 18.4 percent state poverty rate. Valley residents also benefit from a low cost of living as goods and services are about 6 percent less expensive in the city than they are nationwide on average.\n\nValley is a pilot city for the Alabama Communities of Excellence program, a non-profit that partners with governments, businesses, and universities to prepare participating communities for a more vibrant future.\n\n2. Ketchikan, Alaska\n\n• Population: 8,189\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $232,500\n\n• Median household income: $53,937\n\nHealth outcomes are an important factor in the overall quality of life in a given area. In Ketchikan, Alaska, the mortality rate of people admitted to the hospital is 12.2 per 100,000 hospital admissions within 30 days. That figure is the lowest of any major metropolitan area in the state. Ketchikan is the only metro area in Alaska with a mortality rate lower than the U.S. mortality rate of 12.9 per 100,000.\n\nThanks to its scenery along the southeastern coast of Alaska and proximity to the continental United States, Ketchikan is a popular tourist destination, especially on cruises. Though much of Alaska is isolated and rural, Ketchikan offers residents and visitors access to many more entertainment options than most parts of the state – which can be important during the long, dark winters. Ketchikan has more bars, restaurants, and movie theaters than almost anywhere else in the state.\n\n3. Paradise Valley, Arizona\n\n• Population: 13,833\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.6 percent\n\n• Median home value: $1,332,600\n\n• Median household income: $173,487\n\nMost houses in Paradise Valley, Arizona, are worth over $1.3 million, more than seven times the U.S. median home value. Paradise Valley residents are able to afford such expensive houses because of their relatively high incomes. The typical household in the city earns $173,487 a year, one of the highest median household incomes in the country.\n\nParadise Valley lives up to its name as a popular destination to relax. The town is home to several resorts and a number of golf courses. Located just north of Phoenix and Scottsdale, it is also known for its high-end dining and nightlife.\n\n4. Batesville, Arkansas\n\n• Population: 10,579\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.5 percent\n\n• Median home value: $120,400\n\n• Median household income: $42,143\n\nBatesville, Arkansas, ranks among the best U.S. cities to live largely due to its affordability and community attractions and amenities. Most homeowners in Batesville pay less than $1,000 a year in property taxes, less than half the amount the typical American homeowner pays. Overall annual housing costs typically come to about $7,500 a year, roughly $4,600 less than the median costs nationwide. Goods and services are 16 percent less expensive on average in Batesville than they are nationwide.\n\nWith roots as far back as 1804, Batesville is the second oldest city in Arkansas.

Palos Verdes Estates, California\n\n• Population: 13,582\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +1.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $1,609,500\n\n• Median household income: $200,766\n\nLocated along the Pacific Coast less than 30 miles from Los Angeles, Palos Verdes Estates is the best place in California to live. One of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country, the typical household earns over $200,000 a year, more than triple the national median household income of $55,322. Crime is virtually unheard of in Palos Verdes Estates as its violent crime rate of 22 incidents per 100,000 people is a small fraction of the national rate of 383 per 100,000.\n\nThe high ranking may not come as a surprise to those familiar with it, as it is a master-planned city, designed by the Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted – architect of New York City's Central Park and the Stanford University campus.\n\n6. Frederick, Colorado\n\n• Population: 10,791\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +32.2 percent\n\n• Median home value: $261,500\n\n• Median household income: $90,321\n\nFrederick, a small town about a half hour north of Denver, ranks as Colorado's best city to live in. The town boasts a number of amenities that make it an attractive place to live, including a museum, a golf course, over 20 community parks, 25 skiing areas in driving distance, and over 300 sunny days a year.\n\nLike many communities on this list, Frederick is relatively affluent and fast growing. The typical area household earns $90,321 a year, about $27,800 more than the median income across Colorado as a whole.

Well over half of all households in Darien earn at least $200,000 a year and about four out of five adults in Darien have a bachelor's degree or higher. Nationwide, fewer than one in three adults have a bachelor's degree. A high median income is bolstered not only by high educational attainment, but also by a strong job market. Just 3.6 percent of workers in Darien were unemployed in 2017, below the 4.7 percent state and 4.4 percent national 2017 unemployment rates.\n\nDarien is also one of the safest communities in the country. There were just 14 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2017, a fraction of the 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people nationwide.\n\n8.

In the last five years, Middletown's population climbed 13.8 percent.\n\n9. Pinecrest, Florida\n\n• Population: 19,272\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.2 percent\n\n• Median home value: $840,900\n\n• Median household income: $130,900\n\nPinecrest is by far the wealthiest place in Florida, and one of the wealthiest in the entire country. With a median household income of $130,900, most Pinecrest households earn more than double what the typical Florida household earns, which is $48,900. Partially because of the area's relatively high income, the typical home in Pinecrest costs more than $840,000 – more than four times the median Florida home.\n\nA Miami suburb just off Biscayne Bay, Pinecrest is also one of the best educated areas of the state. Among adults 25 and older, 61.7 percent have at least a bachelor's degree. Statewide, just 27.9 percent of adults finished college.\n\n10. Milton, Georgia\n\n• Population: 36,755\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +19.1 percent\n\n• Median home value: $475,300\n\n• Median household income: $109,784\n\nA planned community incorporated in 2006, Milton is one of the most rapidly growing cities in Georgia. Now home to nearly 37,000 people, Milton's population more than doubled since 2009 and is projected to reach 43,000 by 2030. In commuting distance of Atlanta, many Milton residents likely commute to high paying jobs in the state's largest city. The typical household in Milton earns $109,784 a year, more than double the median income of $51,037 across the state as a whole. Similarly, Milton's poverty rate of 5.5 percent is less than a third of the 17.8 percent statewide poverty rate.\n\nMilton is also a safe city. There were just 23 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2017, a fraction of the 383 per 100,000 national rate.\n\n11. Urban Honolulu, Hawaii\n\n• Population: 349,597\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $601,500\n\n• Median household income: $63,361\n\nEducation can be an important factor in the health and well being of a population. In addition to being more financial stable, college graduates tend to live longer and healthier lives than those who did not obtain at least a bachelor's degree. A high level of education helps make Urban Honolulu the best city to live in Hawaii. Among Honolulu adults, 36 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, the highest rate in Hawaii.\n\nLong commutes by car can have a negative effect on physical and mental health. Honolulu residents utilize alternative methods of getting to and from work. Roughly one in every eight residents takes public transportation to work, while many others walk or ride their bicycles. Altogether, 22.9 percent of commuters do not drive themselves to their jobs, over five times more than the next closest city in Hawaii.\n\n12.

While the median household income of $56,522 in Hailey is only about $1,000 higher than the national median income, a dollar goes further in Hailey than in much of the rest of the country. Goods and services are about 4 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average.\n\n13.

One of the wealthiest cities in the state, the typical Winnetka household earns $207,857 a year. Winnetka residents working in Chicago have options when it comes to transit, as over one quarter of commuters use public transportation – an alternative most Americans do not have.\n\nIn the village, downtown shops were described by the Chicago Tribune in 2012 as reminiscent of the Hamptons on Long Island in New York, without the celebrities. Winnetka boasts four beaches, a boat launch, several parks, a tennis club, a golf course, an ice rink, and forest preserve areas, all open to the public.\n\n14. Jasper, Indiana\n\n• Population: 15,790\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +6.6 percent\n\n• Median home value: $148,200\n\n• Median household income: $55,209\n\nJasper is one of the most affordable places to live in Indiana.

Located about seven miles south of Cincinnati across the Ohio River, Edgewood – like many cities on this list – is in commuting distance of a major metropolitan area.\n\n18. Youngsville, Louisiana\n\n• Population: 10,878\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +41.5 percent\n\n• Median home value: $222,300\n\n• Median household income: $94,564\n\nYoungsville is a relatively prosperous city in one of the poorest states in the country.

Bolstered largely by Bath Iron Works, a shipbuilding plant operated by defense giant General Dynamics, the city's job market is relatively strong. Annual unemployment in the city, located near the mouth of the Kennebec River, stands at 3.2 percent, well below the 4.4 percent national rate. Many residents also benefit from the city's walkability as more than one in 10 commuters in Bath walk to work, more than triple the comparable national share. The city is also relatively safe, and also has a high concentration of restaurants, fitness centers, museums, and libraries.\n\nDespite its advantages, Bath is one of only a handful of cities on this list to be shrinking in size. Over the last five years, Bath's population declined by 3.6 percent, even as the total U.S. population grew 3.9 percent.\n\n20. Bowie, Maryland\n\n• Population: 57,633\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.7 percent\n\n• Median home value: $303,900\n\n• Median household income: $106,098\n\nJust a short commute from Washington, D.C., Bowie, Maryland, provides easy access to high-paying jobs in and around the nation's capital.

Nearly three-quarters of adults in the area have at least a bachelor's degree. This college degree attainment rate is well above that of Massachusetts, which sits at 41.2 percent.\n\nThis high level of education, coupled with the fact that Winchester is just outside of Boston, can make it easier for residents to find jobs. Winchester has the lowest unemployment rate, at 2.7 percent, of anywhere in the state. Massachusetts' unemployment rate is a full percentage point higher. This high level of employment likely helps drive down the poverty rate in Winchester. Just 2.4 percent of Winchester residents live below the poverty line, the lowest share in Massachusetts.\n\n22.

The town's median household income of $52,244 a year is several thousand dollars lower than the U.S. median household income. Unlike almost all other places on this list, New Ulm's population shrank over the past five years.

Los Alamos also has one of the best public high schools in New Mexico, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nMany living in the area work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a facility run by the U.S. Department of Energy with a $2.6 billion budget primarily allocated to weapons development.\n\n32. Croton-on-Hudson, New York\n\n• Population: 8,209\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.8 percent\n\n• Median home value: $519,400\n\n• Median household income: $117,656\n\nCroton-on-Hudson is a small village on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, less than 40 miles north of Manhattan. The village is on a train line that goes directly into the city, and largely as a result, more than one in every four workers in Croton-on-Hudson commute using public transit. The village's proximity to New York City contributes to high property values as most homes in the community are worth over half a million dollars.\n\nCroton-on-Hudson is one of the safest communities in New York. There were just 48 violent crimes for every 100,000 village residents in 2017, about an eighth of the national violent crime rate of 383 per 100,000.\n\n33. Morrisville, North Carolina\n\n• Population: 22,600\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +30.5 percent\n\n• Median home value: $291,400\n\n• Median household income: $92,769\n\nMorrisville is situated in the middle of North Carolina's \"Research Triangle.\" The cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill are each home to a major scientific research university – North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, respectively – and several major research-intensive industries have developed in the area.\n\nMorrisville offers close access to each of the three universities, as well as the companies that are located nearby. Morrisville is one of the fastest-growing communities in the entire country. In the past five years, its population grew more than 30 percent, from just over 13,000 to 22,600.\n\n34.

Mandan residents also have access to jobs, entertainment, and cultural attractions in Bismarck, the state capital located on the opposite side the Missouri River.\n\nRecently, business leaders, elected officials, and ordinary citizens established a committee to form a comprehensive plan to improve Mandan over the coming decade. The committee's accomplishments include broadened business support and incentives, the creation of annual festivals and events, public education improvements, and increased communication regarding local elections.\n\n35. New Albany, Ohio\n\n• Population: 9,384\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +25.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $492,400\n\n• Median household income: $191,375\n\nNew Albany, Ohio, is one of the most affluent cities in the country. The median household income of $191,375 is one of the five highest of U.S. cities. Wealthier areas tend to have a number of livability advantages over low-income cities, including lower crime rates. There were just 36.9 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents in New Albany, less than a tenth of the nationwide crime rate. New Albany also has many amenities for residents, including over 600 acres of parks and sports fields.\n\nThere are a number of factors that can draw people to certain towns, including jobs, schools, and amenities. New Albany excels in many of these aspects, and its population growth rate reflects that. The town's population grew by more than 25 percent over the past five years, compared to the national growth rate of just 3.9 percent.\n\n36. Newcastle, Oklahoma\n\n• Population: 9,030\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +21.0 percent\n\n• Median home value: $180,300\n\n• Median household income: $78,144\n\nNewcastle is a small city of less than 10,000 just outside Oklahoma City. One of the fastest growing cities in the state, Newcastle's population spiked by 21 percent in the last five years. As in other cities on this list, Newcastle residents are actively engaged in bettering their community. The city's resident-driven Bridge to 2020 initiative launched in 2007 to develop a long-term strategic plan for the community. In addition to nearby amenities in Oklahoma City, Newcastle boasts seven golf courses, six movie theatres, access to four hospitals, and two shopping malls.\n\nA relatively affluent city, Newcastle's median income of $78,144 is about $30,000 higher than it is statewide and goods and services are about 17 percent less expensive than they are nationwide.\n\n37. Sherwood, Oregon\n\n• Population: 18,965\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +7.5 percent\n\n• Median home value: $313,000\n\n• Median household income: $86,111\n\nSherwood is a small city about 15 miles southwest of Portland. In addition to amenities, attractions, and employment opportunities in the nearby city, Sherwood itself boasts over a dozen parks and a community recreation center and pool.\n\nQuality of life in Sherwood is also bolstered by a low violent crime rate and relative financial stability. There were just 82 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in Sherwood in 2017, less than a quarter the national violent crime rate. Additionally, Sherwood's 4.7 percent poverty rate is less than a third of both the state and national poverty rates of 15.7 percent and 15.1 percent, respectively.\n\n38. Franklin Park, Pennsylvania\n\n• Population: 14,228\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +7.9 percent\n\n• Median home value: $312,200\n\n• Median household income: $121,661\n\nFranklin Park, Pennsylvania, is a borough just outside of Pittsburgh. The area has a relatively high share of residents with high educational attainment. A whopping 70 percent of adults hold at least a bachelor's degree, one of the higher college attainment rates among U.S. cities. Those with college degrees are more qualified for specialized jobs that tend to have higher salaries. In Franklin Park, the median household income of $121,661 a year is one of the highest in the country.\n\nLike many affluent, well-educated areas, Franklin Park is relatively safe. The violent crime rate of 14 incidents per 100,000 people is one of the lowest in the country. Nationwide, there were 383 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2017.\n\n39. Newport, Rhode Island\n\n• Population: 24,570\n\n• 5 yr. population change: -0.1 percent\n\n• Median home value: $382,200\n\n• Median household income: $59,794\n\nNewport, Rhode Island is by far the best educated city in the state. More than half – 50.9 percent – of adult residents completed at least their bachelor's degree. No other major Rhode Island community exceeded the state's college graduation rate of 32.5 percent. This high educational attainment qualifies many of the city's residents for highly skilled jobs and likely helps drive down the unemployment rate. Newport's unemployment rate is just 3.8 percent, the lowest of anywhere in the country.\n\nThough Newport's median household income is close to that of Rhode Island as a whole, homes in the area tend to be much more valuable than those in the rest of the state. Newport's median home value is $382,200, well above Rhode Island's $238,200 median home value.\n\n40. Tega Cay, South Carolina\n\n• Population: 9,026\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +23.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $301,200\n\n• Median household income: $120,346\n\nTega Cay ranks as one of the best cities to live in part because of its relatively high income and the many associated benefits that come with affluence. The city's median household income of over $120,000 is more than double the U.S. median. In a city with a high percentage of affluent households, there are also very few residents struggling with serious financial hardship. Just 0.9 percent of residents live in poverty.\n\nTega Cay lies near the border of the Carolinas and Lake Wiley. The water access gives residents a chance to swim, boat, and fish. As a tourist destination, the city has a high number of bars and restaurants per resident. Tega Cay is growing quickly. It was home to fewer than 5,000 people in 2009. As of 2016, more than 9,000 people lived there.\n\n41. Pierre, South Dakota\n\n• Population: 13,959\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.2 percent\n\n• Median home value: $164,900\n\n• Median household income: $54,868\n\nMost American homeowners spend more than $12,000 per year on housing. In Pierre, South Dakota, most spend less than $8,500 annually. Overall, the cost of living is lower in Pierre, as goods and services are 15 percent less expensive than they are on average nationwide.\n\nPierre, South Dakota's capital, is home to many outdoor amenities largely thanks to its proximity to the Missouri River. Nearby Farm Island and LaFramboise Island offer residents the opportunity to take part in outdoor activities like swimming and hiking.\n\n42. Atoka, Tennessee\n\n• Population: 8,917\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +11.9 percent\n\n• Median home value: $172,400\n\n• Median household income: $87,047\n\nMany cities and towns on this list are in close proximity to a major metropolitan area. About 25 miles northeast of Memphis, Atoka is one of them. In addition to attractions and amenities in Memphis, Atoka itself has several parks featuring playgrounds, sports fields, picnic areas, and a fishing pond.\n\nA safe community, Atoka's violent crime rate of 152 incidents per 100,000 people is less than half the national violent crime rate. Safe streets and proximity to a major city make Atoka an attractive place for new residents and families, and in the last five years, the city's population expanded by 11.9 percent, triple the comparable 3.9 percent national growth rate.\n\n43. West University Place, Texas\n\n• Population: 15,318\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.0 percent\n\n• Median home value: $917,800\n\n• Median household income: $220,868\n\nA wealthy suburb of Houston, West University Place ranks as the best city to live in Texas. A wealthy city, the median household income of nearly $221,000 a year is nearly four times the income the typical American household earns. A dollar also goes far in the city as goods and services are about 5 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average. In addition to entertainment and culture in nearby Houston, West University has a far greater concentration of restaurants, bars, fitness centers, museums and theatre companies than is typical nationwide.\n\nWest University is also a safe city with a strong job market. The city's violent crime rate of 64 incidents for every 100,000 people is among the lowest in the nation, as is the five-year average unemployment rate of 2.7 percent.\n\n44. Woods Cross, Utah\n\n• Population: 10,930\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +15.5 percent\n\n• Median home value: $226,200\n\n• Median household income: $78,750\n\nJust north of Salt Lake City, Woods Cross provides easy access to Utah's largest city, as well as the Great Salt Lake to the west and Grandview Peak to the east. The proximity to Salt Lake City affords Woods Cross residents a short commute to the city, which may help bolster the city's labor force participation rate. More than three quarters of Woods Cross adults, 77.4 percent, participate in the labor force, the most of any Utah community.\n\nThis high labor force participation likely helps drive up the median household income. The typical Woods Cross household earns $78,750 each year, well ahead of Utah's $62,518 median household income.\n\n45. South Burlington, Vermont\n\n• Population: 18,704\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +6.2 percent\n\n• Median home value: $271,900\n\n• Median household income: $66,728\n\nSitting along Lake Champlain, South Burlington is adjacent to Burlington, the largest city in Vermont. With access to a number of nearby colleges, including Champlain College and the University of Vermont, South Burlington's population is well educated. Over half of all the city's adult residents have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the 30.3 percent national bachelor's degree attainment rate. There are a range of employment opportunities in the area, including the University of Vermont Medical Center. Just 2.0 percent of workers in South Burlington were unemployed in 2017, below both the 3.0 percent state and 4.4 percent national unemployment rates.\n\nA strong job market bolsters the financial security of area residents. Just 6.2 percent of South Burlington's population live in poverty, less than half the 15.1 percent national poverty rate.\n\n46. Waynesboro, Virginia\n\n• Population: 21,366\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +1.7 percent\n\n• Median home value: $158,800\n\n• Median household income: $45,097\n\nWaynesboro, an independent city in Virginia, is notable for its affordability, safety, and scenic beauty. Goods and services in the city are about 7 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average. Additionally, the violent crime rate of 182 incidents per 100,000 people is less than half the U.S. violent crime rate of 383 per 100,000.\n\nLocated in the Shenandoah Valley, Waynesboro offers easy access to the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway and the Appalachian Trail. The South River cuts through the city, providing a water trail for residents to fish and enjoy by boat. Waynesboro also has a higher than typical concentration of restaurants, movie theatres, and museums.\n\n47. Snoqualmie, Washington\n\n• Population: 12,510\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +28.3 percent\n\n• Median home value: $471,800\n\n• Median household income: $131,453\n\nSnoqualmie, Washington, is one of the safest places in the country, with just 15 violent crimes for every 100,000 city residents in 2017. The town's property crime rate of 1,077 incidents per 100,000 residents is also less than half the national rate.\n\nAreas with higher median household incomes tend to have less crime than lower income areas. The median annual household income in Snoqualmie, which is within commuting distance of Seattle, is $131,453 a year, one of the higher incomes among American cities. In addition to the culture and entertainment Seattle has to offer, Snoqualmie has a higher than typical concentration of restaurants, bars, museums, and movie theatres.\n\n48. Bridgeport, West Virginia\n\n• Population: 8,364\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +3.9 percent\n\n• Median home value: $199,000\n\n• Median household income: $80,462\n\nIn Bridgeport, 45.3 percent of adults have graduated from college, nearly the highest share of cities in the state. The high college attainment rate has likely contributed to the town's relatively high median household income of $80,462 a year. Not only is Bridgeport wealthy, but it is also inexpensive. Goods and services are 15 percent less expensive than average in the city.\n\nWhen it comes to culture and entertainment, Bridgeport residents have options. The city is home to a far higher concentration of restaurants, bars, recreation centers, golf courses, and movie theatres than is typical nationwide.\n\n49. Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin\n\n• Population: 14,088\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +0.4 percent\n\n• Median home value: $350,700\n\n• Median household income: $105,156\n\nWhitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb along the shore of Lake Michigan, ranks as the best place to live in Wisconsin. The high quality of life in Whitefish Bay is partially the result of a strong job market. The area's average unemployment rate over the last five years stands at just 3.2 percent – less than half the comparable nationwide rate of of 7.4 percent.\n\nWhitefish Bay is also one of the safest communities in the country, with a violent crime rate of just 36 incidents per 100,000 people. For reference, there were 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people nationwide in 2017.\n\n50. Jackson, Wyoming\n\n• Population: 10,279\n\n• 5 yr. population change: +7.6 percent\n\n• Median home value: $573,400\n\n• Median household income: $70,517\n\nThe resort town of Jackson ranks as the best place to live in Wyoming. Jackson boasts a high concentration of restaurants, bars, museums, and movie theatres, as well as access to Jackson Hole, one of the most famous ski resorts in the United States.\n\nIncomes are relatively high in Jackson. The typical area household earns $70,517 a year, about $11,000 more than the typical Wyoming household. Higher incomes are not enough to offset the area's high cost of living, however, as goods and services are about 35 percent more expensive in Jackson than they are on average nationwide. Housing is particularly expensive as most area homes are worth over half a million dollars.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify the best cities to live in every state, 24/7 Wall St. created a weighted index of 26 measures that fall into one of four categories: affordability, economy, quality of life, and community.\n\nIn the affordability category, the ratio of the median home value to the median income was given full weight. Cities where the median home value is closer to the median household income were rewarded. Cost of living, as determined by the average cost of goods and services in an area relative to the nation as a whole, was given a full weight. Property taxes are largely levied at the local level, and cities where residents pay more property taxes as a percentage of their home value were penalized. Property taxes were given a one-quarter weighting.\n\nIn the economy category, we gave median household income full weighting. The unemployment rate was also given a full weight. We used five-year average unemployment due to lack of comparable annual data at local levels. Two-year employment growth and share of the total working age population with a job were each given a half weight, favoring areas with more and growing jobs opportunities.\n\nIn the quality of life category, the poverty rate was given a full weight, penalizing cities where serious financial hardship is more common. The share of the population that struggles to put food on the table either due to low income or distance from a grocery store, known as the food insecurity rate, was given full weight. A city’s mortality rate, calculated as the number of people who died while in hospital care per hospital by city, was also given full weight. In cases where city-level data was not available, mortality rates were imputed from county-level data.\n\nThe drug overdose mortality rate was given a one-quarter weighting, as was the hospital readmission rate, or the share of those released from the hospital who were readmitted within 30 days. Distance from the center of the city to the nearest hospital was given full weight.\n\nMeasures used in the community category include the average travel time to work, which was given full weight. The violent crime rate – the total number of rapes, robberies, murders, and aggravated assaults per 100,000 people – was given full weight. So too was the property crime rate, which is the total number of burglaries, larcenies, motor vehicle thefts, and incidents of arson per 100,000 people.\n\nThe share of commuters either walking, cycling, or taking public transit to work was given half weight. The total number of colleges in the area and the number of restaurants, bars, museums, theatre companies, movie theatres, libraries, and parks per capita were each given a one-quarter weighting.\n\nThe number of hospitalizations that would have been prevented by regularly scheduled doctor visits for every 1,000 Medicare enrollees – known as the preventable hospitalization rate – was given half weighting.\n\nMedian household income, median home value, average travel time to work, poverty rate, population, employment-to-population ratio, median property taxes paid, and average unemployment rate are all five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and are for 2016. Overall cost of living is for 2014 and comes from data analysis and aggregation company ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe population-adjusted number of entertainment and cultural venues like restaurants and museums comes from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns data set, and is for 2016. The number of colleges comes from the Department of Education College Navigator and is as of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nViolent and property crime rates are from the FBI’s 2017 Uniform Crime Report. Drug overdose mortality rates are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are for the years 2014-2016. Mortality rates and hospital readmission rates are from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and are as of June 2015. Preventable hospitalizations are from the latest release from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Akili, who was born in 2005 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and had been at the Birmingham Zoo since 2007, couldn’t be saved after being injured by a lion named Josh, who had been at the zoo since April. The slow process of introducing the lions to each other had begun previously, the zoo said in a statement, and Akili was badly injured within minutes of a meeting on Monday. The introduction was done on a day the zoo was closed so no visitors were present, said Jennifer Ogilvie, a spokeswoman. Josh was brought to the zoo as replacement for another male lion that died in 2021, the statement said. Dozens of people expressed sorrow over Akili’s death in response to an announcement by the zoo on social media.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The wreckage of an airplane reported overdue last week has been located, and the pilot, the only person onboard, found dead, according to the Alaska Department of Public Safety. The department in a statement identified the pilot as 38-year-old Andy Andersen of Sutton. An Alaska Army National Guard helicopter and crew on Thursday afternoon located the wreckage and Andersen at the top of Thompson Pass about 1,000 feet off the Richardson Highway, the statement said. Alaska State Troopers identified the pilot and his body was recovered. The body will be taken to the state medical examiner’s office, the statement said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is investigating.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Heat-associated deaths in Maricopa County, Arizona’s largest, have hit a half-year record as more homeless people live unprotected outdoors in the arid desert city while summer temperatures soar well into triple digits. The most recent data from the Maricopa County Department of Health showed 17 heat-associated fatalities were registered this year through the first week of July, with another 126 under investigation. About two-thirds of the deaths involved people who were outdoors. That number is far greater those recorded during the same period in past years. There were 11 such fatalities in the first six months of 2021 with 107 more under investigation; four during that period in 2020 with another 48 under investigation; and three in 2019 with 27 more under investigation. The health department reported 339 heat-associated deaths in Maricopa County for all of 2021.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gubernatorial hopeful Chris Jones called for increasing Arkansas teacher salaries, following a push by fellow Democrats to put teacher pay raises on the agenda for a legislative session next month. Jones endorsed a proposal that Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson made earlier this year to increase minimum teacher salaries in the state to $46,000 a year. Hutchinson, however, has said he won’t put the proposal on the agenda for next month’s session because of a lack of support in the majority-GOP Legislature. Jones is running against Republican nominee and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who is heavily favored in the November election in the solidly red state. Hutchinson is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. Sanders’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Lawmakers are meeting next month for a special session focused on tax cuts after the state ended the fiscal year with a $1.6 billion budget surplus. Republican legislative leaders have said the special session isn’t the right time to take up the issue because the Legislature hasn’t completed its annual review of education funding required by law. That review is used to recommend increases in school funding and includes a look at teacher salaries.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two motorists had to be rescued from a swamped car when a water main break flooded a Hollywood street early Wednesday. Los Angeles firefighters extended a ladder out to two women who climbed onto the top of a swamped car. The incident occurred before dawn near the U.S. 101 freeway, east of the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: WildEarth Guardians and 13 other conservation and wildlife organizations are calling for a minimum of 150 packs or 750 wolves to be established for four consecutive years in Colorado before state officials consider delisting the animals from protected status. The wolf population threshold was part of a plan the group will present to the Colorado Wildlife Commission before Thursday’s commission meeting in Edwards. The commission is in charge of developing a plan for wolf reintroduction and recovery by next year. A news release by the groups Monday said 750 wolves is “not a cap, but a minimum requirement for future state delisting from ‘threatened” to “nongame status.” That number is five times higher than a recommendation by a group selected to help the state establish a reintroduction and recovery plan.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The suspension of a state dental clinic’s free services means local families will need to travel an hour or more to get dental care for severely disabled family members. In March, the Department of Developmental Services dental clinic in Norwich stopped seeing patients. Months later, parents, SEIU 1199 union staff and others are concerned about how long it will take to reopen. DDS spokesman Kevin Bronson said in an email the department wants better staffing for the center and there isn’t a set time for reopening. With the Norwich clinic closed, Michelle Drake was told to take her son to a facility in Bridgeport, more than an hour away. The Norwich clinic suspension contributes to a lack of care for severely disabled people in eastern Connecticut, outside of the school systems, said Drake, who works for The Arc Eastern Connecticut.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The State Fair returns Thursday, and there are some posh new attractions this year, including a butter sculpture, along with a stacked and diverse concert lineup on the M&T Bank Grandstand. Genres include rock, rap, county, contemporary Christian and Latin music. This summer marks the first time in the fair’s 102-year history that it will feature a Latin artist (Fank Reyes) as a headliner. Nelly will be the first rapper at the State Fair since Flo Rida in 2009. Fairgoers can witness live butter sculpting daily in the Exhibit Hall from noon to 8 p.m. For more information on the fair, visit delawarestatefair.com or call (302) 398-3269.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.’s delegate to the U.S. House, said she plans to introduce a bill to provide additional funding for FEMA’s food and shelter program designated for humanitarian assistance to migrants, including those bused to the District by Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reported. The busing of migrants to D.C. will also be a point of discussion at a Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments virtual meeting Friday.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Fewer manatee deaths have been recorded this year in Florida compared to the record-setting numbers in 2021, but wildlife officials cautioned chronic starvation remains a dire and ongoing threat to the marine mammals. Between Jan. 1 and July 15, about 631 manatee deaths have been confirmed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. That compares with 864 during the same period last year, when a record number of manatees died mainly from a lack of seagrass food, which was decimated by water pollution. The five-year average of manatee deaths in that time frame is 481. Despite some glimmers of hope, wildlife officials said during a news conference Wednesday that manatees continue to face dwindling food options and many survivors have been severely weakened by malnutrition, which leaves them more vulnerable once cold weather sets in. How manatees fare this summer when more food is available will determine how they survive in the winter, said Martine de Wit, a veterinarian overseeing necropsies and coordinating rescues of ill manatees for the state wildlife commission. There are about 7,500 manatees in the wild in Florida, according to wildlife commission figures. They have long struggled to coexist with humans. Seagrass-killing pollution and boat strikes are now the main threats facing the creatures.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: The rollout of a new logo for an Atlanta-area elementary school has been paused after parents noted similarities to a Nazi symbol, though a school district said the design was based on a U.S. Army colonel’s eagle wings. The Cobb County School District said it has halted distribution of the new logo for East Side Elementary School in Marietta after it drew condemnation on social media. The logo depicts an eagle, the school’s mascot, over the school’s initials ES. The Nazi eagle, which was developed in the 1920s and later became a symbol for white supremacists, depicts an eagle holding a swastika in its talons. Georgia’s second-largest school district announced plans to delay the new logo while “immediately reviewing needed changes.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Science Foundation said it plans to conduct a study to evaluate the environmental effects of building one of the world’s largest optical telescopes on a site selected in Hawaii. The agency published a notice in the Federal Register of its intentions to prepare an environmental impact statement for the $2.65 billion Thirty Meter Telescope. The telescope’s supporters have pursued plans to build it on their preferred site on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii’s tallest mountain and one of the world’s best locations for viewing the night sky, for more than a decade. But there is strong opposition from Native Hawaiians who consider the mountain’s summit sacred. The National Science Foundation plans to host four meetings on the Big Island of Hawaii in August. It said it won’t decide on whether to fund the telescope until after it considers public input, the environmental review, the project’s technical readiness and other factors. Protesters blocked construction crews in 2015 and 2019, saying building a new telescope there would further defile a site that they said has been harmed by a dozen other observatories. The TMT International Observatory, the international consortium of scientists behind the project, has selected the Spanish island of La Palma off Africa’s western coast as an alternate if it cannot build in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Endowment Fund that distributes money to public schools and other entities lost $400 million in the fiscal year that wrapped up at the end of June, state officials said. Investments Manager Chris Anton told the Idaho Land Board the fund lost about 13% of its value, dropping from $3.1 billion to $2.7 billion during what has been a tough stretch for investors. However, the fund is up 5.9% over the last three years and 8.3% over the last 10 years. Anton said his primary concern going forward was federal monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation without causing a severe recession. Anton noted that in fiscal year 2021, the endowment fund grew by nearly 30%, gaining about $750 million. The fund is spread out into various equity markets, as well as fixed income and real estate. Real estate is the only investment in the portfolio that went up in the last fiscal year, climbing nearly 28%. But only about 8% of the fund is invested in real estate.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: City treasurer Misty Buscher said she will run for mayor next year, making her the first person to step in opposition to incumbent Jim Langfelder for his fight for a third term. Buscher, 51, has served as city treasurer since 2015 after more than 20 years in the city’s banking industry. Although city elections are nonpartisan, Buscher ran for city treasurer with the endorsement of the Sangamon County Democratic Party, which proved to be problematic the next year, when she identified as Republican and endorsed Donald Trump in his first run for the presidency. That earned her criticism from her opponent in 2019 for the treasurer’s chair, Jennifer Notariano, who had been active in local Democratic politics. Buscher, however, won in a landslide, getting nearly three-quarters of the vote for re-election. If elected, she would be the second woman to serve as mayor, after Karen Hasara served two terms from 1995 to 2003. She is the fifth woman to serve in elected city office and the second to serve as treasurer, with Judy Madonia serving in the role from 1987 to 2003. The other two women to serve in city office are Cecelia Tumulty, who was city clerk from 2003 to 2015 and her predecessor Norma Graves, who served from 1987 to 2003.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An Indiana law aimed at prohibiting abortions based on gender, race or disability is going into effect after a federal judge lifted an order first issued six years ago blocking its enforcement. U.S. District Judge Tonya Walton Pratt granted an order Monday removing her injunction that was sought by the Indiana attorney general’s office after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last month to allow states to make laws regarding abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana had successfully sued to block the law after it was adopted by Indiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature in 2016, but it conceded defeat in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIowa\n\nJanesville: Fairbank Mayor Gregory “Mike” Harter, 71, died when a vehicle he was in driven by a 14-year-old driver’s education student collided with another vehicle, authorities said. Harter died at the scene of the crash Monday morning on U.S. 218 near Janesville, city officials said. Police said the vehicle being driven by a 14-year-old from Waterloo went onto the shoulder. The driver overcorrected, crossed the highway and median and collided with an oncoming car, police said. The driver and another 14-year-old in the car, and the driver of the second vehicle, were injured, police said. Harter was mayor of Fairbank since 2018 after serving for two years on the City Council, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. He was a former educator who retired nearly a decade ago as a school superintendent.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A couple that moved to Mississippi a month ago finally got their possessions back, 28 days after movers left Topeka with them. Jean St. Felix, the owner of Miami-based JM Moving Co., returned those possessions early Tuesday night at a storage facility in Ocean Springs, Miss., where Craig and Linda Wright now live, Linda Wright said. Almost everything the couple owned was packed into a 26-foot U-Haul trailer driven by St. Felix, which left June 21 from their North Topeka storage unit, ostensibly en route to Ocean Springs. The Wrights said they paid St. Felix $3,500 up front before he left Topeka with their possessions in a U-Haul that surfaced empty days later. After that, Linda Wright said she touched base with St. Felix every third day to get a progress report.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear and mental health advocates in Kentucky expressed hope Monday the launch of the 988 mental health crisis hotline will help remove the stigma of reaching out for assistance. The hotline went live nationally on Saturday, offering quick help for suicidal thoughts and other mental health emergencies. People taking the calls are trained counselors. Beshear noted suicide is the second-leading cause of death among youth and young adults in Kentucky. Counselors can link Kentucky callers to other mental health and substance abuse services, providing a “strong safety net” in communities, said Audra Hall, coordinator of emergency services for Pennyroyal Center in Hopkinsville.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Amid worsening problems at a south Louisiana juvenile detention facility – including a weekend escape that allegedly ended with a violent carjacking – Gov. John Bel Edwards said some of the youths will be temporarily moved to the state penitentiary at Angola. Edwards said about half of the 50 or so juveniles at Bridge City Center for Youth will be housed in coming weeks at a “secure, independent housing unit” at the penitentiary at Angola which once served as a reception center. The governor said the youths “will not, under any circumstances, have contact with adult inmates.” Simultaneously, construction crews will begin renovating a section of the Jetson Center for Youth in Baker. Once that work is complete, the juveniles relocated to Angola will be transferred there, he added.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine has been deemed an “unusual mortality event,” sparking a federal investigation into strandings that appear linked to avian influenza. The seal strandings began in June and 159 have been reported through Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Most of the seals were found dead. The NOAA gave the strandings, which have affected harbor and gray seals, the “unusual” designation Friday. That authorizes a federal investigation to try to determine the cause and minimize deaths. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed samples from four stranded seals tested positive for avian flu, which has been found in more than 40 states since it was detected in the winter of 2021. The risk to the public from the occurrence of avian flu in seals is low, but beachgoers should take precautions anyway, NOAA representatives said.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: More than 1,000 locations across Somerset County in the lower Eastern Shore are scheduled to be connected to broadband internet because of federal and state funding. On July 8, Gov. Larry Hogan announced $100 million in internet infrastructure grants to jurisdictions across the state with money received through the federal American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two police unions want to roll back limits on when they can use tear gas, pepper spray and other less-than-lethal crowd control methods, which the City Council implemented last year. The unions are asking a judge to rule on whether the City Council ordinance is valid and enforceable, and also on the validity of an independent board to investigate allegations of police misconduct created in January. The Boston Police Superior Officers Federation and the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society filed the suit Monday in Suffolk County Superior Court. The ordinance came about after Boston police were criticized for some of their crowd control measures during a June 2020 protest, amid nationwide demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The unions said the use-of-force rules are based on politics and put public safety at risk.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort by Republicans in the Legislature to weaken minimum wage and sick-leave laws was declared unconstitutional Tuesday. A judge on the Court of Claims threw out changes made late in 2018 as Republican Gov. Rick Snyder was near the end of his term and Democrats were preparing to take over top statewide posts. Advocates had turned in enough signatures to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2022 and eliminate a lower tipped wage in the restaurant industry. The minimum wage now is $9.87 an hour; less for tipped workers. There was also a successful petition drive to expand sick leave opportunities. The Legislature adopted both in 2018 – a possible step – instead of letting voters have their say. But lawmakers then returned a few months later and watered them down by a simple majority vote. Appeals are likely. Wendy Block of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce said businesses could suffer with the sudden changes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State government employees who are unvaccinated for COVID-19 are no longer required to take weekly tests for the virus in order to stay in the workplace. The requirement that went into effect in September meant thousands of employees took tests each week. Those that didn’t comply were subjected to suspensions or other discipline. A state official said the requirement was rescinded because of the evolving nature of the virus. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for the Department of Minnesota Management and Budget, said agencies can still adopt their own procedures. And, a small number of state workers in health care settings are still bound by federal vaccination rules that took hold in January. Without publicity, Gov. Tim Walz’s administration rescinded the policy in late May, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A county-owned Mississippi hospital system that wants to put itself up for sale said one of its main financial challenges is the decision by the state’s elected officials not to extend Medicaid to provide insurance coverage for the working poor. Singing River Health System is owned by coastal Jackson County. The system operates hospitals in Pascagoula, Gulfport and Ocean Springs. It also has about three dozen clinics and more than 3,500 employees. Trustees of the system announced June 1 that they had voted to put it up for sale or to seek a merger with another health system.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Missouri State University completed the purchase of its newest residence hall, built through a partnership with a private developer. Matt Morris, vice president for administrative services, confirmed the purchase price of $24 million. The seven-story, 402-bed hall on the west side of campus at 811 S. Holland Ave. sits on less than an acre. It is expected to open in August with every bed taken. It includes a four-story parking garage with 285 spaces. The residence hall rooms are on the upper floors. There is dining and retail space in the building. An executive committee of the MSU Board of Governors was expected to vote Wednesday to name the building Heitz House.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Montana Republican Party platform opposes nearly all abortions after a vote of those attending the party’s platform convention over the weekend. Party members on Saturday approved a platform that opposes all elective abortions. They rejected a proposal to allow exceptions for rape or incest, Montana Public Radio reported. “What makes this language even harder for me is in the case of rape and incest, because I do not believe that the baby should be responsible for the sins of another person,” Rep. Jedediah Hinkle of Belgrade said during the meeting in Billings. The platform does allow abortion care in cases of miscarriage or threats to the life of the mother, Republican lawmakers told the Montana State News Bureau, although the allowable circumstances are not completely known. Party spokesperson Alden Tonkay did not return an email seeking comment on Tuesday. No one answered the phone at the Montana Republican Party headquarters in Helena. In Montana, access to abortion care is protected by the privacy right guaranteed in the state Constitution, according to a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling. Republican lawmakers passed several bills regulating abortions during the 2021 legislative session. Three of the new laws are temporarily blocked by an injunction that the state has asked the Montana Supreme Court to vacate.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department reported 656 COVID-19 cases last week, about a 2% decline from the 671 cases from the previous week, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. But as of Monday, there were 57 COVID-19 patients in Lincoln hospitals, the highest number since Feb. 20, although that number dropped to 44 as of Tuesday.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: A transformer exploded Tuesday at Hoover Dam, one of the nation’s largest hydroelectric facilities, producing a thick cloud of black smoke and flames that were quickly extinguished. No one was injured in the explosion near the base of the dam, an engineering marvel on the Colorado River that straddles the border of Arizona and Nevada. Electricity produced at Hoover Dam continued flowing to the 8 million people in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California who rely on it, the Western Area Power Administration said. The cause of the fire was under investigation and officials were working to determine the extent of damage to the transformer, one of 15 at the complex that control the voltages for power sent to customers. “There is no risk to the power grid,” said Jacklynn Gould, a regional director for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: Construction of the city’s new skateboard park off Route 33 could begin as soon as next spring. Mayor Deaglan McEachern said the project, which will also include a multipurpose playing field, a bicycle pump track and parking, is something “we’d like to see started as soon as possible.” His comments came Tuesday after the City Council voted last week to approve a bond issue of $1.8 million for the new park, which will be located at what is known as the city’s stump dump. McEachern said the project will likely be built in phases, with the skatepark being completed first, followed by the multipurpose field.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRed Bank: An air conditioning failure at Riverview Medical Center’s emergency room prompted a partial evacuation Wednesday morning, even as the Jersey Shore faces a stretch of miserably hot and humid weather. Several units “went offline,” according to a statement from Tony Perry, a spokesman for Hackensack Meridian Health, which operates Riverview. Emergency workers from the New Jersey EMS Task Force, Monmouth County Office of Emergency Management and EMS coordinators and Neptune Township Office of Emergency Management responded to the hospital, setting up six air conditioning units, according to a Facebook post from the Monmouth County Sheriff’s Office. Medical ambulance buses from Middlesex and Monmouth counties also responded.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: A transmission line will send wind power generated in southern New Mexico 550 miles west into Arizona, where it could serve urban markets there and in California. The SunZia Transmission project was acquired by Pattern Energy and will combine with the company’s existing plans to develop wind power in the region. The line starting near the border of Lincoln and Torrance counties will have a capacity of 3,000 megawatts – enough to meet energy needs of 2.5 million Americans, per a report from Pattern. Together, the wind and transmission projects marked an $8 billion investment by the company, and construction was planned to begin in 2023.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Former Mayor Bill de Blasio said he is ending his campaign for a U.S. House seat in New York, dropping out after two months by saying it’s clear “people are looking for another option.” The Democrat was running in a crowded primary for a deep-blue congressional district that includes his Brooklyn home and parts of southern Manhattan. He considered running for governor of New York but opted not to challenge incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. He also had a short-lived run for president in 2019, which lasted two months longer than this year’s congressional campaign. Recent polling had placed de Blasio near the bottom of the field of 13 Democrats seeking to represent New York’s 10th Congressional District. Jerry Nadler represents New York’s 10th district now but will no longer live in it after redistricting.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A former interim head of North Carolina’s community college system will return to the position while its governing board seeks a permanent replacement for President Thomas Stith III, who abruptly resigned this week. The State Board of Community Colleges voted Wednesday to appoint Bill Carver as interim president, a position he held in late 2020 while the board decided to choose Stith to succeed Peter Hans. The board announced Tuesday it accepted Stith’s resignation, effective Friday, after barely 18 months on the job. His departure came days after the board met privately in part to consider Stith’s performance. Board members also have been concerned about high personnel turnover at the system office in Raleigh.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The operators of an ethanol plant in North Dakota said the state’s first carbon capture and storage project is up and running. Carbon emissions from Red Trail Energy’s plant near Richardton are injected thousands of feet into the earth as a way to fight climate change, as less carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. Red Trail CEO Gerald Bachmeier said after six years of research, development and investment, the company is celebrating the achievement which “establishes a trail for other industries in the state to follow.” North Dakota’s Industrial Commission approved the project last fall, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Gov. Doug Burgum, who leads the commission, has a goal of making North Dakota carbon-neutral by 2030, which involves striking a balance between the carbon dioxide released from within the state and the amount of emissions contained or offset in some way.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The City Council approved a new jobs growth incentive agreement Monday night estimated to deliver $1.53 million over five years to Aware, a Columbus-based software firm that designs systems for employers to monitor and analyze their workers’ electronic communications and interactions. The seven-member Council approved the Aware tax-sharing agreement unanimously. It gives the software firm 25% of the municipal income tax collected on new employees, and 30% if those employee live within the city, for the next five years. The city stands to make more than $4 million over five years for its cut of the new employee taxes, according to a city Development Department analysis.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal audit report sharply criticized Oklahoma officials for a lack of transparency, oversight and accountability in the use of coronavirus relief funds that were intended for education. The state, which received nearly $40 million in pandemic assistance for the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief, or GEER, Fund, has returned more than $919,000 that was unspent from the program. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General report dated Monday recommended the state return nearly $653,000 more that was spent on noneducation-related items such as televisions and Xbox gaming systems by families that received grants. The document also called for the state to audit another $5.4 million for possible refund of misspent funds, and develop better management and internal controls of the spending. A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, Kate Vesper said the report is being reviewed.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregonians will decide in November whether people wanting to purchase a gun will first have to qualify for a permit, after one of the strictest gun-control measures in the nation landed on the ballot. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan’s elections division determined Monday the gun-safety campaign delivered enough verified signatures of registered voters to put Initiative 17 on the ballot for the Nov. 8 election. Election officials said 131,671 signatures were validated, more than the minimum 112,080 that were needed. The measure would ban large-capacity magazines of more than 10 rounds – except for current owners, law enforcement and the military – and require a permit to purchase any gun. To qualify for a permit, an applicant would need to complete an approved firearm safety course, pay a fee, provide personal information, submit to fingerprinting and photographing and pass a criminal background check. The state police would create a firearms database. Applicants would apply for the permit from the local police chief, county sheriff or their designees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Pocono Raceway and the NASCAR Foundation kicked off race week with a surprise visit from Tricky the fox at the Pocono Family YMCA on Monday morning. Pocono Raceway President Ben May and Tricky handed out Speediatrics Fun Day Festival Kits to the children in attendance. The kits were packed with gear for the children to complete the weeklong program, which is geared toward inspiring children to lead a healthy lifestyle through the lens of NASCAR. Supplies included an activity book with colored pencils, a water bottle, a pedometer watch, sunglasses and more. The program will culminate in the inaugural Speediatrics Fun Day Festival at Pocono Raceway on Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Anthony Silva, Gov. Dan McKee’s former chief of staff, did not break the law by involving himself in efforts to secure approval to develop wetlands in which he had a financial interest but he did show “poor judgment,” state Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a report released Wednesday. Although Silva’s dealings with state Department of Environmental Management and Cumberland town officials were not criminal, his conduct undermined confidence in state government, the 22-page report concluded. Silva resigned in August when the issue became what McKee called a “distraction,” and the Democratic governor requested the investigation. Silva maintained he did nothing wrong.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A House committee reviewing South Carolina’s abortion law suggested the state ban almost all abortions other than when the life of the mother is at risk. The state has a ban at roughly six weeks that includes exceptions for rape and incest. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, conservatives in the General Assembly started to look at whether they could join the growing number of states banning the procedure. The 12-member special panel voted 9-3 with all eight Republicans joining one of the House’s most conservative Democrats in approving the new bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Patients enrolled in South Dakota’s medical marijuana program will have their first opportunity to buy cannabis from a state-licensed facility next week. It has been a year and a-half since state voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana. The co-owner of one dispensary, United Rd. in Hartford, said the business has secured the first initial inventory available to state-run stores and the showroom is ready for customers. The building was created with security in mind, said co-owner B.J. Olson. “We started with a vault and then built the building around the vault. We have 8-inch poured concrete walls, reinforced with rebar,” Olson said. Medical marijuana so far has only been available on tribal land in South Dakota, but next Wednesday, Unity Rd. will be the first state-licensed dispensary to offer cannabis.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Human Rights Board of Commissioners has named Muriel Malone Nolen executive director to oversee the agency. Nolen was named executive director effective Monday after working with the agency since 2021, according to a news release. She previously worked as an assistant district attorney general in Shelby County for 18 years. Nolen replaces Beverly Watts, who stepped down in February after news outlets reported that a state investigation found she created a toxic work environment.\n\nTexas\n\nGeorgetown: The city has attracted a new solar roof business with the help of a $3.24 million incentive package that includes property tax abatements and job credits. GAF Energy, a Standard Industries company, has begun building a 450,000-square-foot facility on the southeast corner of Interstate 35 and Southeast Inner Loop, according to a city news release. Construction is expected to be finished in June 2023. The company plans to hire 265 employees in high-tech jobs over the next 10 years, the city said. It said the total capital investment for the project is estimated to be more than $100 million in that time. The net 10-year economic impact to Georgetown is estimated to be $3.75 million, city officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Police bomb squad members gave the “all clear” after checking on a bomb threat made at Utah Tech University late Tuesday. Campus police evacuated buildings in the vicinity of the Smith’s Computer Center on the university’s main St. George campus after dispatchers received a call reporting the threat at about 3 p.m. The buildings were swept by the bomb squad four times and then given the all-clear, according to Jordan Sharp, UT Vice President of Marketing and Communication. The search took roughly an hour to complete.\n\nVermont\n\nHinesburg: A Vermont family’s chicken is back home after hitching a ride in the undercarriage of their pickup truck and ending up 13 miles away in the state’s largest city late last month – a journey that included speeds of 65 mph on an interstate. Someone having coffee on Burlington’s Church Street Marketplace, an outdoor pedestrian mall, spotted the chicken and knew the bird was in a predicament, WCAX-TV reported. Witness Lo Fasano called rehabilitators, Shelburne Farms and the police. “They said they don’t do chickens,” Fasano said. So Fasano took the chicken home, gave her food and a place to nest, and turned to social media. A Facebook post led to finding the chicken’s owners in Hinesburg who were worried about the lost hen. The chicken is now home. Because of her adventurous spirit, the family changed her name from Bug to Amelia after Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVirginia\n\nTappahannock: A fire that spread quickly through the downtown area damaged or destroyed part of a historic district, impacted businesses and displaced at least one family, officials said. The fire swept through downtown buildings in Tappahannock on Friday, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Several firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion in the fire that began before noon in the back of a furniture store on Prince Street, a block south of the Downing Bridge that spans the Rappahannock River. Officials also said other nearby buildings in the town’s historic area, including several vacant homes, were damaged or destroyed, affecting an art gallery, real estate office, beauty parlor and café, as well as apartments above the businesses. Tappahannock Essex Fire Chief Paul Richardson estimated damage at close to $2 million, although more time will be needed to fully assess the situation. It’s not known how the fire started. To fight the fire, firefighters at one point had to draw water from the nearby Rappahannock River when the town’s water supply wasn’t enough, Richardson said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Department of Ecology has canceled the drought declaration for central and eastern Washington because of unanticipated cool, wet weather in May and June. Water supply conditions have been much better than expected, and as a result, no part of the state is experiencing drought conditions, Ecology officials said Tuesday in a statement. Washington had the second-wettest May-through-June since 1895, officials said. That has preserved snowpack which will support late-summer water supply needs, according to Jeff Marti, the department’s statewide drought coordinator. This year’s conditions are in stark contrast with the spring of 2021, which was the second-driest on record. An unprecedented deadly late-June heat wave in the Pacific Northwest then broke temperature records across the state.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Interstate 64 in West Virginia reopened Wednesday, a day after a tractor-trailer carrying a hazardous material overturned. The truck rolled over early Tuesday on westbound I-64 in Charleston. No injuries were reported. About 600 gallons of an acetone-based material spilled, destroying the highway’s pavement, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release. A contractor repaved the site. Westbound lanes of I-64 at the split with I-77 were shut down for more than 24 hours before being reopened late Wednesday morning.\n\nWisconsin\n\nKeshena: The Menominee Indian Tribe said it is relaunching its effort, in partnership with Hard Rock International, to open a casino and entertainment complex in Kenosha. The tribe will be the owner of the casino complex and Hard Rock will be the developer and manager. Hard Rock International had planned to partner with the Menominee tribe to develop an $800 million hotel and casino at the former site of Dairyland Greyhound Park in Kenosha. The plan, approved by the City of Kenosha and Kenosha County, was rejected by then-Gov. Scott Walker in 2015. Menominee Chairman Ronald Corn, Sr. said the revived effort is aimed at providing necessary resources for the ongoing and growing needs of the tribe, which is ranked as one of the largest and poorest in Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Supreme Court reversed the prison sentence of a Jackson woman now serving 20 years for aggravated vehicular homicide, concluding the judge in her case considered two constitutionally prohibited factors when he punished her last year, the Casper Star Tribune reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/26/businesses-reopen-parked-planes-coughing-criminals-hasbro-masks-news-around-states/111626130/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Now that flooding from the Alabama River is easing, Riverfront Park is on the verge of a soggy comeback Friday. The park has been off limits for a couple of months because of flooding and damage from a swollen Alabama River. When Riverfront Park reopens, it will join dozens of Montgomery’s other parks as an outdoor area for people enjoy while observing coronavirus safety restrictions. Several weeks of flooding had left the park's walkway, Riverwalk Amphitheater and a large chunk of the open grass area covered in sand, dirt and muck. One place that will remain high and dry is Riverfront Park’s splash pad. It's closed until further notice because of coronavirus restrictions. Montgomery remains under Gov. Kay Ivey's statewide stay-at-home order. One exception is that people are allowed to participate in an outdoor activity as long as there are fewer than 10 people and everyone can maintain a constant 6-foot distance from each other.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Businesses in parts of Alaska cautiously began reopening Friday as part of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s plan to restart segments of the economy affected by coronavirus concerns. Signs of the times were everywhere: barbers wore face masks, and notices warned of limits on customer numbers. In Juneau, whose downtown core typically hums this time of year, many storefronts remained dark. The city earlier Friday urged businesses to wait to commit to reopening until the Assembly on Monday considers whether to “moderate” Dunleavy’s reopening approach. In Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz outlined plans for reopening Monday largely consistent with Dunleavy’s approach. Alaska is among the first states in the West to begin reopening, allowing restaurants to resume dine-in service and retail shops, personal care services and other businesses that were classified as nonessential to operate, all with limitations. Dunleavy, a Republican, has said health considerations must come first and that officials feel good about Alaska’s numbers, health care capacity, equipment and ability to track cases. The state has reported fewer than 350 cases of COVID-19, which includes 208 recovered cases, and nine deaths.\n\nArizona\n\nMarana: Hundreds of airliners idled by the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the travel industry and other circumstances crowd a southern Arizona airfield where workers are trying to make room for even more aircraft that might not take to the skies again soon. Pinal Airpark just off Interstate 10 between Casa Grande and Tucson as of last week was providing storage space for approximately 270 aircraft, and manager Jim Petty said most of them were there because of the pandemic. About 250 miles away in northwestern Arizona, officials at Kingman Municipal Airport hope to also attract some of the plane-storage business as airlines ground more aircraft and move others to longer-term storage locations. The region’s warm, dry climate is considered ideal for mothballing aircraft, the Arizona Daily Star reported. Airpark can probably accommodate an additional 100 planes, depending on how large they are, said Jim Petty, Pinal County’s airport economic development director. Workers recently have been clearing new areas to accommodate even more arrivals. The influx of aircraft began in March as travel restrictions and plummeting demand prompted carriers to slash service on many international routes.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: No traditional in-person high school graduations can be held in Arkansas until at least July 1 because of the coronavirus pandemic, but schools that want to hold a ceremony earlier can explore virtual options, state officials said Saturday. “In some communities, they want to go ahead and do something in the normal time and in that case, we are going to allow them to create non-traditional, either by remote means, by digital means, by video,” state Education Secretary Johnny Key said. “There are a number of techniques that schools have already started exploring.” Key said that as they approach July 1, they will consult with health officials to see if the date needs to be modified. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he has received many calls asking about high school graduations. “I’m very sympathetic because I have a granddaughter who is a senior in high school this year but it’s really a risk whenever you bring thousands of parents and students together in one assembly,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Two women have been charged with stealing items from a Walgreens in San Francisco and escaping by coughing at employees and claiming to have the coronavirus. Carmelita Barela, 36, and Rosetta Shabazz, 32, were charged with robbery affecting interstate commerce, federal prosecutors announced Friday. The San Francisco women were arrested Thursday. It wasn’t immediately clear whether they had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. A federal complaint said the women entered the store near the Civic Center on April 6, carrying empty bags. “After the store manager offered assistance, Shabazz allegedly began to cough without covering her mouth,” according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office. The store manager asked Shabazz to leave if she was sick. “Instead, Shabazz walked over to Barela and both defendants began to cough audibly while taking merchandise off the shelves and placing it into their bags,” the statement said. “The manager told the defendants to leave the store, to which they responded by saying, “We have COVID.’ ” The manager and a security guard didn’t want to go near the women, who filled their bags with about $90 worth of goods and left without paying, authorities said. If convicted, the women could each face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: There won’t be a Greeley Stampede this summer because of concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus, organizers said Saturday. The popular rodeo and accompanying musical performances have been “postponed” and are unlikely to take place in 2020, marketing coordinator Kevin McFarling said. Those who had purchased tickets will be offered the choice of receiving a refund or a credit toward 2021 performances. Information on claiming a refund or credit will be available soon at GreeleyStampede.org. The Greeley Stampede is generally regarded as one of the premier rodeos in the country, making USA TODAY’s top 10 list in 2018 and 2019. It ranks among the top 20 in prize money on the Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association circuit. Musical performances this year were scheduled to include Chris Young, 3 Doors Down, Brett Young, Jon Pardi, LOCASH, Phil Vassar and Lecrae.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is moving to increase testing for the new coronavirus, offer free transportation to testing appointments and launch a community education campaign to lessen the impact on black, Hispanic and low-income residents, who have been hit disproportionately hard in communities of color across the country. About 820 city residents have tested positive for the virus and about 72 have died as of Friday, but Mayor Luke Bronin said the true scope of the local outbreak is unknown because of the lack of widespread testing. The city will also be conducting outreach to families who have confirmed cases of the virus, as well as those with suspected cases and is putting together a public education campaign in English and Spanish that will promote social distancing, wearing masks and hand washing, as well as provide information on health services and other resources.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware residents are now required to wear face coverings in public settings, according to Gov. John Carney’s latest modification to his state of emergency declaration. The order, which goes into effect at 8 a.m. Tuesday, deems settings like grocery stores, pharmacies, doctor’s offices and public transportation as mandatory places to wear face coverings. This also includes outdoor public spaces like parks and golf courses, “if maintaining social distancing of six (6) feet between individuals of different households is impracticable,” according to the order. The directive does not apply to children 12 or younger. It also requires businesses to follow a number of additional requirements starting May 1, including requiring employees to wear a face covering while working in areas open to the public or when coming within 6 feet of other staff. Additionally, it requires businesses to provide face coverings and hand sanitizer to their employees, as well as deny entry to people who do not have a face covering.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The National Capital Poison Center said calls from people being exposed to hand sanitizer and disinfectants have seen a surge since March compared to the same time period last year. The report came as bogus home remedies for the new coronavirus continue to be discussed on areas of social media and following controversial comments President Donald Trump made during a news conference on Thursday. Information obtained from the National Capital Poison Center showed a dramatic rise in calls dealing with human exposure to hand sanitizer and disinfectants in areas around Washington, Northern Virginia, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County. According to the report, the center has dealt with 314 calls for disinfectant human exposure since March 1. The number marked an 111% increase compared to the same time period last year. The poison center also reported that the group has seen 112 calls dealing with human exposure to hand sanitizer since March 1, marking a 24% increase from a year ago.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Two of the state’s largest police departments said they would delay buying body cameras because of financial concerns spawned by the coronavirus outbreak. Tampa police said that it would put on hold the purchase of more than 600 cameras that were supposed to have been acquired by the end of the year, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Across the bay, the St. Petersburg Police Department said that a body camera testing program has been delayed indefinitely, which in turn is postponing a decision by Police Chief to seek funding for hundreds of cameras. The city of Tampa had signed a five-year, $5 million contract to purchase more than 600 blue-tooth activated cameras that would have been distributed by the end of the year to every uniformed officer through the rank of corporal. Of that cost, about $1 million would have come from this year’s budget, Police Chief Brian Dugan said. However, the department is proceeding with a $500,000 purchase of Tasers.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Business owners who chose to reopen after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed coronavirus-related restrictions gratefully welcomed back customers, while others remained satisfied in their decision to stay closed. Russ Anderson, who owns four Ink Addiction Tattoo Studio shops in south Georgia, said Saturday he was thrilled to finally reopen his doors a day earlier. “I felt like a little kid at Disney World,” he said. Gyms, tattoo shops, nail salons and barber shops were among the businesses that were allowed to open Friday after Kemp relaxed a monthlong shutdown despite of warnings from health experts and disapproval from President Donald Trump. Another round of reopenings is set for Monday, when limited in-restaurant dining can resume and movie theaters can reopen. All the businesses have to adhere to restrictions including separating workers and enhanced sanitation. Shawn Gingrich, CEO and founder of Lion’s Den Fitness, said he decided very soon after the governor’s announcement that he would not be reopening his gym in midtown Atlanta right away. As he listened to the news on the radio Friday about businesses that were reopening, he felt discouraged. “We’ve sacrificed so much already,” he said Saturday. “I feel like if we do this too soon, we’ll see a spike in cases and we’re back to square one.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Saturday extended the state’s stay-at-home order and the mandatory quarantine for visitors through May 31. “This was not an easy decision. I know this has been difficult for everyone. Businesses need to reopen. People want to end this self-isolation and we want to return to normal,” Ige said in a statement. “But this virus is potentially deadly, especially for the elderly and those with preexisting conditions.” Ige also announced that elective surgeries can now take place and beaches will be open for exercise. At a news conference to outline the moves, Ige pointed to alarming COVID-19 clusters on the Big Island and Maui, Hawaii News Now reported. “We still need to remain vigilant,” he said. In his statement, Ige warned of undoing Hawaii’s progress in containing the virus if public places open up too early. The governor also extended an eviction moratorium, which prevents any eviction from a residential dwelling for failure to pay rent, through May 31.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The head of an economic recovery committee formed by Gov. Brad Little to help the state reopen for business while also fighting the new coronavirus said Friday he’s optimistic Idaho will rebound, but there’s hard work ahead. Idaho Power CEO Darrel Anderson said the state can recover and even be poised to thrive when the pandemic passes, but businesses might have to adopt new practices. “What I would say is that the people of Idaho always seem to find a way,” Anderson said. “Idaho has always shown up when the chips are down.” The committee has about 30 members and is comprised of a cross-section of small and large business owners, including billionaire Frank Vandersloot, founder of wellness shopping club Melaleuca. Representatives from Micron and Simplot are also on the committee, as are several elected officials, including Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, a rancher.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: A biochemical research company has opened a new site in Illinois to sterilize used N95 medical masks with hydrogen peroxide gas as the need for them has increased because of the coronavirus pandemic. Columbus, Ohio-based Battelle started the cleaning process at the Waukegan sterilization facility earlier this month, the Chicago Tribune reported. Company officials said the site can clean up to 80,000 masks daily. Health care workers use the N95 masks to prevent the spread of the virus. But supplies have plummeted amid the outbreak. The facility is intended to serve hospitals and first responders for free, said Lewis Von Thaer, CEO of Battelle, a nonprofit with a long history of government contracting. The Illinois site has been sterilizing masks for Advocate Aurora Health’s Illinois and Wisconsin hospitals, according to Battelle. Battelle has six pilot sterilization facilities. The federal government has awarded the company a $400 million contract to build 60 more facilities across the country. It will hire more than 1,000 people. The masks are not soggy after the cleaning process because the hydrogen peroxide is in gas form. The chemical is odorless and leaves behind no toxic residue, the company said. Company officials said the fabric of the mask does not break down, but the elastic bands will after about 20 cleanings.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The cancellation of conventions, conferences and trade shows because of the coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on tourism in Indianapolis, a tourism official said. Indianapolis attracted a record-breaking 30 million visitors last year, according to Chris Gahl, the senior vice president of marketing and communications for Visit Indy. Gahl said his nonprofit, which promotes Indianapolis, is doing its best to salvage the 2020 events that have been called off. Typically around 70% of Indianapolis hotel rooms are occupied but hotels are currently at around 7% occupancy. More than 80,000 residents depend on tourism for a paycheck, according to Visit Indy statistics, which showed that visitors spend $5.6 billion in Indianapolis and generate $725 million in state and local taxes. Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 17 extended Indiana’s stay-at-home order to May 1. He has said he hopes to reopen parts of Indiana’s economy starting in May, though organizers of conventions, sporting events, concerts and other events that attract large crowds might have to wait longer.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The state’s three major public universities are planning to resume in-person classes in the fall, but they are still working out the details of what that would look like during the coronavirus pandemic. Iowa Board of Regents President Mike Richards said the schools will follow state and federal health guidelines as they develop plans to bring thousands of students back to the campuses of the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and Northern Iowa University. Board of Regents spokesman Josh Lehman told the Des Moines Register that specific plans for the fall semester will be shared as they are developed. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds is beginning to ease some coronavirus restrictions even though COVID-19 is still spreading in Iowa. University of Iowa President Bruce Harreld said the school is taking a cautious approach to planning for the fall. Iowa State President Wendy Wintersteen said in a letter to faculty and staff last week that the school is facing more than $80 million in losses and additional expenses since April 3 because of the pandemic. That total includes nearly $17 million in refunds to students and families for housing, dining and other fees. Wintersteen said she will continue to prioritize the health of students, faculty and staff as plans for the fall are developed.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: Gov. Laura Kelly said she has reached a deal that could resolve a lawsuit brought by two churches challenging her order banning religious gatherings of more than 10 people to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Under the deal, the two churches and the Democratic governor agreed to the extension of a temporary restraining order that allows the churches to disregard the 10-person limit. The court’s initial order let the two churches to gather in-person until May 2 as long as they complied with social-distancing measures, including keeping worshippers a safe distance from each other. The new proposal would extend that court order to May 16. The agreement, which a judge must still approve, essentially allows the churches to continue in-person services while the governor finalizes plans for her less restrictive statewide reopening orders that would take effect on May 4. The churches and their pastors filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month against Kelly, arguing that the directive violates their religious and free-speech rights, as well as their right to assembly. A religious freedom advocacy group, Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a news release that it reserved the right to continue litigating the matter if the governor does not follow through with “appropriately amending her mass gathering ban.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Nearly four dozen rural hospitals in Kentucky will receive help in fighting the coronavirus pandemic after they received a total of $3.8 million from the federal CARES Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Saturday. The University of Kentucky Center of Excellence in Rural Health is getting $3,878,582 through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and the funds will go to 46 rural hospitals to support their efforts in fighting COVID-19, McConnell said in a news release. The emergency relief package aims to support American workers, families and industries facing health and economic challenges under the pandemic. The UK Center of Excellence in Rural Health, based in Hazard, was established by state legislation in 1990 to study and help fix health disparities in rural Kentucky. The CARES Act funding gives hospitals “maximum flexibility” in how they respond to COVID-19 within their communities, according to the release. The money could support testing and lab services, for example, and also purchase personal protective equipment for hospital staff working to treat COVID-19 patients. The Kentucky Office for Rural Health will oversee the disbursement of the federal funds to 46 rural hospitals across the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nReserve: A nursing home for veterans has one of the state’s deadliest coronavirus clusters, data showed. In the last month, there have been 43 deaths at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Home in Reserve, though just more than half were attributed to the virus, said Brandee Patrick, a spokeswoman for the facility’s operator, the state Department of Veterans Affair. The home, which held around 150 veterans when the outbreak began, now has just 96 left, The New Orleans Advocate reported. Five of them are hospitalized. Of the rest, 47 have tested negative for the virus, 34 have tested positive and six had inconclusive results, Patrick said. St. John the Baptist Parish Coroner Christy Montegut has said it’s possible that some of those nursing home residents who died early in the outbreak could have had the virus. That comes after new evidence showed the virus was infecting Americans earlier than previously thought. The facility has been on lockdown for more than a month. Contact has been limited to phone calls and videoconferencing.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: More than a dozen Maine health care industry groups representing hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and others are asking Gov. Janet Mills for civil and criminal immunity during the civil state of emergency caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The request asked Mills to suspend the laws holding health care providers and their employees responsible for death or injury during the state of emergency, the Bangor Daily News reported Saturday. Harm due to gross negligence would be an exception. Because Maine’s Legislature has adjourned, the action would need to come through an executive order from the governor. The governor’s office is still reviewing the request, Mills spokeswoman Lindsay Crete said. Jeff Austin, a spokesman for the Maine Hospital Association, said its members were particularly concerned about having to reallocate resources in the event of a surge in cases\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis:Gov. Larry Hogan said Maryland could be ready by early May to begin phase one of its recovery process if residents continue to stay home and abide by social distancing guidelines. Maryland isn’t ready to lift restrictions right away, but the governor said he’s optimistic in which he introduced the state’s recovery plan. The two key metrics officials are watching are the rate of hospitalizations and the number of patients being admitted to ICUs. The Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery takes into consideration the guidelines recently issued by the White House and the principles of the National Governors’ Association recovery plan, as well as input from experts. Recovery will be gradually rolled out in three phases. Hogan said the first phase will involve lifting the stay-at-home order, reopening many small businesses and restarting low-risk community activities. Certain counties with lower case concentrations will be allowed to reopen retail shops, golf courses, playgrounds and libraries, as well as begin recreational boating and fishing, tennis, outdoor fitness and religious activities. But social distancing would need to continue. As long as there’s no spike in deaths or admissions to intensive care units, Hogan said the state would then move on to phase two, which would allow for a larger number of businesses to reopen, including restaurants and bars, with significant safety precautions in place.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Massachusetts factory that usually makes some of the nation’s most beloved board games, including Monopoly, Risk and Candyland, has pivoted to making personal protective equipment for heath care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker said Saturday. The Cartamundi-owned Hasbro factory is making 50,000 face shields per week for hospitals in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican said after a tour of the East Longmeadow facility. Making games and making personal protective equipment have the same goal, President and COO John Frascotti said. “It is our job to make the world a better place for children and their families,” he said. Baker also said an investigation into the high number of COVID-19-related deaths at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home is progressing, but there is no timetable for completion. Former federal prosecutor Mark Pearlstein has “free reign” to conduct his investigation, Baker said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Foster child placement agencies are facing new challenges because the governor’s stay-at-home order has blocked most birth parents from visiting their children in wake of coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision has prompted worries that families providing foster care or completing certification may stop because of health concerns or job losses. Janet Reynolds Snyder, executive director of the Michigan Federation for Children and Families, a Lansing-based association that has about 60 family support and child welfare service agencies in the state, said the directive supports good health, but it is important for foster children to have access to their biological parents. JooYeun Chang, executive director of Michigan’s Children’s Services Agency with the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, said discontinuing contact was a “painful” decision for the administration. Cynthia Johnson, an Oakland County resident who is caring for children ages 1, 5 and 6, is helping the two oldest with their school curriculum because the governor’s order has closed school districts. Johnson and her husband, Michael, keep contact with the children’s relatives frequently. “My job is to make sure that these kids are safe,” Johnson said. “We have to look out for ourselves, and we both have to look out for the kids.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: City officials are putting an end to pickup basketball games and other outdoor recreation because people continue to gather in city parks and fields as the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board announced Friday it will close courts, athletic fields, playgrounds and skate parks by May 1, the Star Tribune reported. The decision includes removing or blocking basketball rims, removing tennis and volleyball nets, and posting signs notifying park visitors that soccer fields, playgrounds and skate parks are closed. The city has received more than 125 complaints of large groups at parks, many playing sports such as soccer and basketball, officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A school district in the Mississippi Delta should wait to try to borrow money because voters might be reluctant to support a bond issue during the coronavirus pandemic, said a retired educator who serves in two elected offices. David Jordan spoke last week at a board meeting for the Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School District, the Greenwood Commonwealth reported He is a Democrat who serves in the Mississippi Senate and on the Greenwood City Council. The Greenwood Leflore district is considering a bond issue but has not specified how large it will be. It also has not set an election date. At least 60% of local voters must approve before a school district can borrow money through a bond issue. Jordan said reaching that margin can be difficult even without the financial uncertainty of the pandemic. Jordan mentioned a failed attempt to pass a 1998 bond issue that would have built a new Greenwood High School and a new elementary school. A less ambitious attempt by the Greenwood district four years later also failed. The Greenwood and Leflore County school districts have merged in the past two years. Jordan said the board should wait a couple of years for a bond vote. “I don’t think now is the time to do it because of what we have before us, the epidemic,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: State health officials are hoping that a new testing strategy will help quickly identify people infected with the new coronavirus at meatpacking and food plants throughout the state. Outbreaks of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have occurred at several U.S. meatpacking plants, where hundreds of people work next to each other on production lines and often share space in locker rooms and cafeterias. Several plants have been forced to temporarily close. In Missouri, at least 21 employees tested positive at Burgers Smokehouse, a smoked and cured meats plant in the small city of California. Forty-two of the 700 employees at a Conagra frozen meals plant in Marshall have also contracted COVID-19. And in St. Joseph, 16 workers at a Triumph Foods pork plant tested positive. Dr. Randall Williams, Missouri’s health director, said the state is deploying a new strategy to quickly test workers, including those who are asymptomatic, at plants where confirmed cases have occurred. The goal is to more quickly identify those who have the virus in the hopes of preventing it from spreading. Triumph Foods spokesman Chris Clark said all 2,800 employees of the St. Joseph plant will be tested, even those showing no symptoms.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state took its first, halting step toward reopening on Sunday as churches were able to resume services and a general stay-at-home order expired. Although other states have been extending restrictions amid the continuing spread of the new coronavirus, Montana is among those that are beginning to loosen rules in hopes of restoring battered economies and regaining some normalcy. At Christ the King Lutheran Church in Billings, Pastor Ryan Wendt said the church was mixing faith with common sense precautions. Every other pew was being kept empty to comply with social distancing guidelines and elderly and medically vulnerable members of the congregation were advised to stay home. “This is God’s house. We are not doing frivolous, needless things. Not in a weird way, we simply trust that God is going to protect us and provide for us,” Wendt said. But some religious houses stayed shuttered as their leaders expressed worry that returning too soon could put people at risk. “We’ve been keeping our building clean and open and sanitized, but we’re not ready now. We just want to do a little more,” said Beth Rager with the Open Bible Christian Center in Billings, which plans to reopen in May. During the first phase of Montana’s reopening, which has no set timeline, people over age 65 and those with underlying health conditions are asked to continue to stay at home. Gyms, pools, movie theaters and bowling alleys will remain closed. Residents are still asked to minimize non-essential travel and to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning to the state.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Business owners are starting to plan their comeback now that Gov. Pete Ricketts has unveiled his plan to ease coronavirus restrictions. Ricketts said Friday that he will relax restrictions in 59 counties, including those in the Omaha area. The new orders, effective until May 31, allow restaurants to reopen their dining rooms but require them to keep crowds at or below half of their capacity. Dining parties will be limited to six people, buffets will remain closed and bars will have to keep their dining areas closed. Ricketts’ plan also allows barbershops, tattoo parlors, salons and massage therapists to reopen, though they must adhere to social distancing precautions. Paul McCrae, owner of the Corner Kick Street Tacos and Tequila Cantina in Omaha, called the easing of restrictions a “life-saver,” especially with Cinco de Mayo the day after the reopening date. “That’s a big day for us,” McCrae told the Omaha World-Herald. But co-owners Kelsey Poulsen and Sarah Root of The Copper Pin Salon & Spa haven’t decided whether to open on May 4. About half of the 14-person staff don’t yet feel safe to return, they told the newspaper. “We’re thinking about taking the hit financially and keeping it closed until we can figure out how to safely operate,” Poulsen said. Ricketts, a Republican, didn’t order similar changes in the Lincoln area because that region’s public health restrictions don’t expire until May 6. The restrictions in the Omaha area were set to expire April 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Hundreds of people gathered in Reno on Saturday for a second straight week of protests against Gov. Steve Sisolak’s sweeping efforts to contain the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The latest “Reopen Nevada” rally, like last week’s march to the Capitol in Carson City, was held in open defiance of statewide executive orders meant to encourage social distancing and prevent public gatherings of 10 or more people. Police estimated about 250 people showed up for the event. It also underscored the widening political divide over elected officials’ approach to fighting the pandemic, efforts protest organizers framed in starkly partisan terms. Monica Jaye – a conservative, Reno-based radio talk show host who headlined Saturday’s rally at Rancho San Rafael park – said officials had willfully inflated the virus’ death toll to push a leftist political agenda. She found plenty of sympathetic ears in a crowd dominated by supporters of President Donald Trump and organized by a group that has launched a bid to recall Nevada’s first-term Democratic governor. Jaye later said she had a better chance of being struck by lightning than dying of the coronavirus, a claim that won loud applause from the crowd.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Officials have shut down more than 100 trail heads, shelters, picnic areas and other sites in New Hampshire’s White Mountain National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service said Friday said the decision was based on federal, state and local guidance for physical distancing and to ensure the health and safety of employees, visitors and volunteers. It comes after officials reported an unseasonably high number of visitors who were “not able or willing” to follow social distancing recommendations. Trails remain open to those who can get to them on foot, but the state is under a stay-at-home order and officials have urged people to stay local for outdoor recreation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCarteret:Mayor David Reimen is calling for the temporary closure of an Amazon warehouse following a report of a number of employees infected with the new coronavirus. NJ.com reported that after Business Insider quoted an employee as saying there were more than 30 cases of COVID19 at the Carteret Amazon fulfillment center, Reimen called on Middlesex County and state health officials to shutter the facility until all workers can be tested and the facility can be sanitized. An Amazon representative confirmed that there were cases but declined to tell NJ Advance Media how many employees at the Carteret facility tested positive for the virus. Spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the company is “supporting the individuals who are recovering” and taking “extreme measures” to ensure the safety of workers. Reiman also called on the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to make sure there were proper protective supplies at the million-square-foot facility that employs 1,600 people. An advocacy group, Make The Road New Jersey, called on the governor to use his executive authority to shut down the warehouse, alleging that “it’s clear this outbreak is beyond Amazon’s control.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The City Council has extended Mayor Ken Miyagishima’s citywide emergency declaration order over the coronavirus pandemic. At a special Friday meeting, the City Council voted unanimously to extend the declaration, which was first proclaimed April 7, extended by council vote on April 10 and ran until April 24. The city plans to run the emergency proclamation concurrent with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s stay-at-home public health order, which lasts until May 15. The city council could, however, vote to rescind it before that order expires. The council approved an emergency powers provision for the mayor last month because the city previously had no mechanism for the mayor to declare an emergency. Miyagishima declared the citywide emergency April 7 to make it easier for the city to receive federal aid reimbursements for expenses incurred by the city as it fights the effects of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday he hopes to have a road map by June 1 on how to rebuild the city after the coronavirus threat subsides. The mayor, a Democrat, said at a news conference that city leaders he has invited to help plan the city’s recovery should give him the road map by then. He said a full rebuild will take about 20 months. He also said the latest statistics on people being treated for COVID-19 continued to be stable or decline. The number of people in the city’s hospital intensive care units had dropped from 785 to 768. De Blasio said the city can’t begin reopening until decreases continue for 10 to 14 days. He said such a fall would signal it was time for the first steps in opening up. “The health indicators have to give us the all clear,” de Blasio said. “We restart when we have evidence. There’s no on-off switch here. It’s a series of careful, smart moves.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWelcome: NASCAR team owner Richard Childress is auctioning one of the cars driven by the late Dale Earnhardt to raise money for coronavirus relief efforts. The Charlotte Observer reported that this is the first time Childress has sold or given away an original Earnhardt car from his personal collection. A news release Thursday from Richard Childress Racing officials doesn’t specify which of Earnhardt’s trademark No. 3 race cars is up for auction. Childress tweeted Friday that parting with one of his cars is “a small sacrifice” for him to make. Earnhardt died in a crash during the last lap of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway in 2001. The eBay site for the auction doesn’t list a deadline for bidding on items.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s largest manufacturer, Doosan Bobcat, has resumed operations after daylong shutdown to clean the factory after an employee reported symptoms of the new coronavirus. Doosan Bobcat public affairs director Stacey Breuer said in a statement the factory in Gwinner reopened Saturday night. The employee has tested positive for COVID-19, she said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Parkers Blue Ash Tavern is closing permanently, according to a recent announcement on its website. Although the message is no longer on its site, an employee confirmed the business was closing because of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is with heavy hearts that we must announce the permanent closure of Parkers Blue Ash Tavern,” read a statement on the restaurant’s website. “The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry and Parkers, in particular, has proven insurmountable for us to reopen.” The company said it will give refunds for issued gift cards. Gift card reimburses will be given once the corporate office is reopened. Email your contact information, gift card number and return mailing address to info@selectrestaurants.com. “We will always value the relationships we’ve formed over the years and will forever cherish our times together with you, the Blue Ash community.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some businesses are reopening in parts of Oklahoma after Gov. Kevin Stitt eased restrictions put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, salons, spas and barbershops were allowed to reopen in much of the state, despite concerns from medical professionals. Those businesses have been told to adhere to social distancing standards, have employees wear masks and frequently sanitize equipment. Some of the state’s largest cities, including Norman, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, decided to keep their bans in place until at least the end of the month, but other municipalities that had bans in place lifted them to align with the governor’s authorization. The mayors of Tulsa and Oklahoma City announced they would lift their stay-at-home orders next Friday, when Stitt, a Republican, has said that restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and places of worship can reopen. Teri Stevens, owner of The Barber Shop in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, told the Tulsa World that she was back at work cutting hair. She said her face was hot from wearing a mask and the atmosphere was “a little weird” because there’s usually “a little more camaraderie and people being out in the waiting area and everybody talking and socializing.” But Stevens said it was good to be back to work.\n\nOregon\n\nAlbany: The National Frozen Foods plant in Albany has shut down production because of an outbreak of COVID-19 that has sickened 10 people, Linn County Public Health announced Friday. Of the illnesses linked to the plant, eight are workers and two are associated with those employees, The Albany Democrat-Herald reported. The county worked with the plant to temporarily close the facility, said Linn County Sheriff’s Capt. Michelle Duncan, the county’s coronavirus pandemic spokeswoman. Steve Schossberger, general counsel and vice president of National Frozen Foods, said the shutdown started Friday and will continue at least through the weekend. A deep cleaning of the Albany plant will be done with the oversight of Linn County Public Health, he added. “We’ll look at opening back up on Monday, but only on automated lines. … That’s still yet to be determined,” Schossberger said. On the automated lines, workers would be at least 20 feet apart, he said. Employees will be notified by National Frozen Foods about how to receive testing and the next steps of the process. National Frozen Foods opened its Albany plant in 1982 and puts out millions of pounds of frozen produce each year. The plant processes beans, cut corn, squash, vegetable purees and cream-style corn, according to the company’s website.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state said 160 companies in 43 counties are getting help from a second round of state loan funding to help firms during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Community and Economic Development said the companies have received a total of $13.5 million in loans as part of the COVID19 Working Capital Access Program. More than $23 million total has been awarded so far to businesses such as restaurants, wellness centers, wineries and breweries, consulting firms, salons and spas, officials said. Officials said the loans will help businesses quickly access capital to address critical needs while they follow shutdown and closure orders from the state.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Even in the midst of the fight against the new coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo is thinking about the budget process. Much depends on aid coming from Congress, she said Saturday. “Everything is on the table,” she said. “It’s going to be a brutal budget to balance.” She said layoffs and furloughs are inevitable. The state is “redeploying as many people as possible” to jobs where they are most needed now, such as contact tracing, she said. Department of Administration Director Brett Smiley said the Moody’s ratings service might have significantly underestimated Rhode Island’s revenue losses this year and next, The Providence Journal reported.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia:In accepting delivery of 1.5 million surgical masks from China, officials in South Carolina took an opportunity Sunday to express appreciation for the supplies needed to stem the coronavirus outbreak but to also call for a lessening of U.S. reliance on the foreign country. “We want the masks made in the United States,” U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said during an availability on the tarmac of the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport after watching the unloading of the masks from a Boeing aircraft. “We don’t want to ever have to rely on China or anyone else for our basic health care needs.” Throughout the outbreak, Graham has repeatedly called for a draw-down of U.S. reliance on China, tweeting earlier this month he wanted the U.S. response to COVID-19 to be “so overwhelming China will change its behavior.” The Republican also told Fox News he felt the U.S. “should send China a bill for the pandemic.” Noting he expected a resurgence of the virus in the fall, Graham said Sunday he wanted the U.S. to be “much better prepared” in terms of needed supplies by the time that happens. U.S. Rep. William Timmons echoed Graham’s comments, saying of the necessity of a mask shipment from China: “This will not happen again.” The 1.5 million masks delivered Sunday are enough to equip PRISMA hospitals in South Carolina for one month, according to CEO Mark O’Halla. Of the shipment, 100,000 are being sent to the Medical University of South Carolina, he said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Bars and restaurants are among the city businesses that could reopen under a plan that would require social distancing precautions to guard against spreading the new coronavirus. The City Council is scheduled to vote Monday on Mayor Steve Allender’s proposal, the Rapid City Journal reported. It would require bars and restaurants to maintain a minimum of 6 feet between tables, chairs and bar stools. Establishments would be allowed to have a maximum of 10 people, or for larger buildings, one customer for every 125 square feet of space. Food service employees would also be required to wear masks. Tony Demaro, owner of Murphy’s Pub & Grill and Kol, said he has been working with his staff to practice social distancing at the pub and is excited about the possibility of reopening next week. Takeout and delivery at his two businesses haven’t generated enough revenue to sustain being closed much longer, Demaro said. Justin Henrichsen, owner of Independent Ale House, said it would be difficult to make money under the proposed capacity restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:A federal appeals court has ruled that Tennessee must continue allowing abortions amid a temporary ban on nonessential medical procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak. The ruling followed a U.S. District judge’s order last week that abortions could proceed during the pandemic. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati, issued its opinion Friday. The justices wrote that courts must give governments flexibility to respond to a crisis. “Affording flexibility, however, is not the same as abdicating responsibility, especially when well-established constitutional rights are at stake, as the right to an abortion most assuredly is,” the court wrote in the 33-page opinion. Tennessee’s attorney general had argued that abortions are not being singled out but treated like any other procedure that is not necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury. Gov. Bill Lee issued an emergency order April 8 banning nonessential procedures for three weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: As Texas eases restrictions put in place to fight the coronavirus pandemic, one clothing store owner said Saturday that most of her customers so far are sticking to having orders shipped even though retail “to go” is now allowed. Allison Scott, who along with her parents owns a franchise of the clothing store Apricot Lane in Dallas, said though that she thinks the “to go” offering does provide some happiness to those “who are just itching to go somewhere.” As of Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, allowed retailers to sell items for curbside pickup. Also last week, he reopened state parks and is allowing doctors to perform nonessential surgeries. But appointments at salons and dine-in restaurant service, for instance, are still not yet allowed. At Galleria Dallas, the shopping mall where Scott’s Apricot Lane store is located, shoppers can now pull up and their purchases are placed in their vehicle. Scott said that on Friday they took five orders down to customers, and none on Saturday. She said that as much as she would like to see things return to the way they were and people be allowed to shop in person again, she said she thinks it’s too risky health-wise right now.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:To raise the spirit of residents and rekindle the importance of community bonding during the coronavirus pandemic, the City of St. George’s Leisure Services department has invited all residents to participate in the no-cost Stay Brighter Campaign from April 30 through May 30. The campaign is a 60-minute daily challenge that encourages citizens to stay active, stay kind and stay smart every day with 20 minutes allotted for each of the three disciplines. Examples include staying active by going for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood, staying kind by doing things such as mailing a card to a grandparent or donating to a local food bank and staying smart by reading a book or learning something new. “We want to continue to spread joy and to work together — though we are physically apart — to show love, concern and support for others,” Michelle Graves, St. George Deputy Director of Arts and Events, said. “This time is a gift to stay sharp, creative, giving and healthy. We encourage St. George citizens to be a positive change in our city.” All residents are urged to participate and the daily challenge log, as well as more examples of each of the three disciplines, can be found online at www.sgcity.org/staybrighter.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre Town: City officials plan to hold a “drive-thru” election rather than have voters cast ballots by mail in its annual election in June. The town pushed the election back from May to at least June 2 amid Gov. Phil Scott’s stay-home order in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Last week, the Select Board unanimously approved the drive-thru voting system and sending voters postcards about the election, The Times Argus reported. Town Clerk Donna Kelty had recommended that the election be held by mail but some select board members had concerns with that. Voters can still request a ballot and vote by mail\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dozens of students from a Virginia medical school are doing their part in the fight against the new coronavirus by volunteering to care for the children of health care workers. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that nearly 100 students from Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine have joined a new student organization called the VCU Childcare Co-op. Co-founder Annie Yang, a first-year medical student, said the student volunteers already have donated more than 250 hours to help more than 20 families, including those with a parent caring for COVID-19 patients. The students are caring for children, as well as pets. “Even as students, we can step up and make a small difference in our community,” Yang said. The COVID-19 pandemic has closed down many child care centers across Virginia. Gov. Ralph Northam announced earlier this month that Virginia is using $70 million in federal aid to help health care workers and others with child care.\n\nWashington\n\nEast Wenatchee: Dozens of farm workers at a Central Washington orchard have tested positive for COVID-19, though they weren’t experiencing symptoms, according to a newspaper reported published Saturday. Stemilt Ag Services, which operates the orchard, and local health officials tested the farm workers in East Wenatchee after some fruit packaging warehouse workers tested positive, The Spokesman-Review reported. The company said it decided to expand testing to orchard workers as a precaution. Of the 71 agricultural workers who were tested, 36 were positive for COVID-19, Stemilt reported this week. Despite social distancing measures in place at the orchards, there were a high number of positive cases, said Barry Kling, administrator at Chelan-Douglas Health District. Some people who have COVID-19 showed no symptoms. Stemilt was one of the first companies in the region to test a group of workers that was asymptomatic, but the company is still evaluating its next steps, said Roger Pepperl, Stemilt marketing director, in an email. Stemilt has been following Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention recommendations for social distancing. Workers who tested negative will be retested and are in isolation, according to a Stemilt press release. All workers who were tested are work visa holders and arrived around February. United Farm Workers and other advocates filed a lawsuit about a week ago against Washington state, arguing that farm workers do not have adequate protections. The groups called on the state departments of Health and of Labor & Industries to update safety guidelines. United Farm Workers is a union but does not represent the Stemilt workers who were tested.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Fire Capt. Scott Leep said he had prepared for the last day of his 22-year career at the department to be a quiet affair. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, there would be no way the 42-year-old could have a retirement party with his friends, family and co-workers. He had loaded his gear onto the fire truck for the last time before he heard honking and cheering. Leep’s friends at the department, along with coordination from his wife, held a surprise retirement parade for him as they drove by Fire Station 4 on April 22. Leep said he doesn’t plan to stay retired for long. This week, he will begin a new career as a power line worker for American Electric Power.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers’ office was flooded with hundreds of emails in the hours surrounding his decision to extend Wisconsin’s stay-at-home order, accusing him of destroying the state’s economy, begging him to let business reopen and warning that voters will punish him, an Associated Press review found. One woman pleaded with Evers to let her visit her husband in hospice before he dies of brain cancer. Other people demanded he let youth baseball resume and allow hair salons to reopen. A hairdresser wrote that Evers’ hair looks so good on TV he must be using a stylist in violation of his own order. Asked about the messages during a video conference, Evers acknowledged people and businesses are struggling but said the best way forward is to attack the virus. He said his order isn’t as restrictive as other states’ stay-at-home mandates. Evers issued a stay-at-home order in March that closed schools and nonessential businesses and mandated social distancing in an effort to slow the coronavirus. The order was supposed to lift Friday, but Evers on April 17 extended it until May 26, the day after Memorial Day.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Legislative leaders began crafting two bills Friday morning that grant some abilities to Gov. Mark Gordon and state agencies to respond to Wyoming’s numerous needs that have emerged in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The Legislature’s Management Council, which consists of leaders from both chambers and parties, met virtually Friday in preparation for a special session that could come as soon as late next month, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The council did not vote on the two pieces of legislation, which touch on everything from hospital funding to low-income housing. Instead, legislators prepared the bills for a final vote at their next meeting on May 1. The first bill worked by lawmakers would set up a COVID-19 relief fund for a preliminary, partial distribution of the $1.25 billion Wyoming has received through the federal coronavirus relief bill. Gordon has the ultimate authority on how to use those funds, but through the legislation, the pot would be divided into a few separate sections to address various needs. Federal rules also prohibit the relief funds from being used to replace lost state revenues, forcing state officials to get slightly more creative with how they use the money.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/26"}]}

Biden himself has been projecting optimism in the final days of the campaign, but reality is setting in for Democrats their majority rule in Congress could soon end – and Biden’s ability to get his top priorities passed could go with it.\n\nWhite House officials have begun pointing out their losses aren’t likely to be nearly as bad as previous midterm wipeouts, including in 2010, and say the fact Democrats have a fighting chance at all is a positive sign for Biden. But his advisers privately acknowledge that they don’t see a viable path for Democrats to hold onto their House majority, though the president and his senior team are starting the day with the view that the prospect of Democrats holding on to their Senate majority is real – even if it’s one that may take days, or longer, to be fully realized.\n\nWith the intraparty blame game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, the White House moved Tuesday to separate Biden’s agenda – and the president himself – from the list of targets. The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies more than two dozen individual poll results they say underscores the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden’s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration’s response to Covid-19\n\n“Before all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the president’s agenda – nothing could be further from the truth,” the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction.\n\nYet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn’t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country.\n\n“We’ve passed so many good things,” Biden said at a fundraising event last week. “They’ve been so good people haven’t realized how good they are yet.”\n\nThe effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden, relegating the party’s leader mostly to Democratic states and districts as the party scrambled to save its majorities. It’s a reality advisers say Biden doesn’t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden’s view has long been that the candidates know what’s best for their state or district. But as Biden’s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats.\n\nThe defensive tone in the memo echoes a message Biden has repeatedly sought to emphasize in the closing days of the campaign, one that centers on the idea that the election represents a choice between two parties, not a referendum on Biden or his presidency.\n\nA loss of a few seats – Republicans need only pick up five seats to take control of the House – would mean dramatic changes for the president.\n\nHere are four areas that are at stake this Tuesday for Biden and his administration:\n\nGOP investigations\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have made abundantly clear that if they take control of Congress, Biden should get ready: Investigations are coming his way.\n\nA majority in the House or Senate would hand GOP lawmakers powerful chairmanships on a number of oversight committees, giving them the ability to launch investigations targeting Biden, the White House and even members of the president’s family.\n\nAnd so far, Republican members have indicated that they’re eager to target all of the above.\n\nGOP lawmakers including Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan, who are likely to chair the House Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively, are getting ready to probe a range of issues, from the business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter; to what Republicans allege is political interference by the FBI and Justice Department; to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the drumbeat of impeachment talk – for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or even the president himself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House. Hear his answer 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\nWhite House officials have been expecting and preparing for this new world for months, including by making personnel hires earlier this summer to beef up its oversight operations. Officials say if Republicans do in fact, take control of Congress, the White House is prepared to beef up those efforts even more with additional hires, and believe it will be ready to push back on future GOP investigations as lacking in merit, politically motivated and nefarious.\n\nWhile officials have been cautious not to get in front of any GOP actions or pre-judge the results of the election, they are also keenly aware of political dynamics that may work in their favor, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n“American people historically don’t respond well to egregious overreach,” one of the people told CNN, specifically citing a new Republican majority’s battles with former President Bill Clinton. “We’ll be prepared, but it’s tough to look at House Republicans and think this won’t wander into that territory.”\n\nAgenda\n\nThe historic likelihood that Biden would lose seats – and majorities – in Congress has loomed over the White House his entire term so far. It is part of what motivated the president’s ambitious legislative agenda, including major Covid-19 relief and a bipartisan infrastructure package, in the earliest months of his presidency.\n\nIf Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the era of big, progressive bills will likely end. Instead, Biden will be on the defense as Republicans work to undo much of what he accomplished in the first two years of his term.\n\nThe GOP has already vowed to roll back elements of Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including its new, higher taxes on corporations. And they could work to roll back or challenge some of the president’s climate initiatives that are included in the package.\n\nOther areas where the president has vowed action, like cementing into law the nationwide right to abortion, would have no chance of advancing if Republicans take control. And other programs, like student loan relief, could be subject to blocking efforts by the GOP.\n\nIn all of these areas, Biden is poised to wield his veto pen in rejecting potential Republican attempts to undermine his agenda. As president, Biden has not vetoed any bills, a facet of Democratic control on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhite House officials have already been quietly preparing for the areas where agreement is a necessity – spending bills and an increase of the nation’s debt limit. The two issues represent must-pass items that have been at the center of a series of Congress vs. White House battles over the last decade.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has been among a number of House Republicans who have pledged to deploy similar tactics should they take the majority.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy tells CNN first bill would be on border security if GOP wins House 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe first concrete signs of how that may play out will quickly become apparent. Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill this month with a matter of weeks to reach an agreement to fund the government.\n\nAt the same time, Biden has a long history of working with Republicans to advance pieces of legislation. And he vowed when running for office to find areas to work across the aisle, something he was able to do on several of his key cornerstone legislative wins.\n\nBiden advisers point to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law and the $250 billion semiconductor manufacturing and science bill as providing a road map to bipartisan success.\n\nBiden’s 2024 decision\n\nAs soon as the 2022 midterm election results are in, national attention will immediately turn to 2024 – including on the question of whether Biden will seek a second term.\n\nWhile Biden and his aides have been quietly thinking about his political future for months and they have accelerated conversations in the last month, those deliberations will accelerate with the close of the midterm cycle. Biden has pointed to family meetings during the holiday stretch as important to his decision-making, though people familiar with the matter say first lady Dr. Jill Biden and others are on board with another run.\n\nFor weeks, the president and his advisers have maintained that his intention, for now, is to run again. Biden moved quickly to transfer his 2020 operation to the Democratic National Committee after he defeated former President DonaldTrump. The party committee has spent the last two years maintaining and beefing up his grassroots list, fundraising pipeline and building out state-level infrastructure that would make up the critical infrastructure of a nascent campaign.\n\nThey’ve also said that no decision is final until the president has had ample opportunity to discuss his political future with his family. But Biden’s 2024 decision won’t just be a family affair – there will also be strong political dynamics at play.\n\nFor one, Trump’s decision to seek a second term – and the timing of that potential announcement – is expected to be a key factor. Biden advisers continue to believe that the president is best positioned to take on his predecessor, and are confident about a second Biden vs. Trump contest.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Al Franken's reaction to Trump's 2024 tease 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother consideration: How fellow Democrats respond to the results of Tuesday night. Polling from this fall indicates a majority of Democrats say they do not want Biden to run again in 2024. And losses for Democrats could only exacerbate the sense within the party that a change in direction is required.\n\nWhile many elected officials in Biden’s party have been loyal in expressing their public support for a second term, some others have openly called for change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who said over the summer that he does not believe Biden should run again, told CNN on the eve of Election Day that he believes “a majority of Democrats” feel the same way.\n\n“Regardless of tomorrow’s results, I believe Democrats must rebuild our brand and repopulate our bench of future leaders – for both Congress and the White House,” Phillips said. “President Biden has fulfilled his promise to serve as a stabilizing ‘bridge’ to the future, and I expect a majority of Democrats will be seeking a next generation candidate to take the baton in 2024.”\n\nStaffing changes\n\nBiden has seen remarkably little turnover in the first two years of his tenure among his Cabinet and senior team. The halfway mark of his first term, however, could be a natural moment for staff changes.\n\nIt reflects a reluctance to shake up his team, despite calls at various points to dismiss members of his administration. Biden has refrained from firing or asking for the resignation of any members of his Cabinet and sought to lock in his senior team months ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\nThere has been turnover among his senior staff, including in top West Wing positions. His press secretary, White House counsel and senior adviser for public engagement all left earlier this year. Some officials decided to leave the White House around the one-year mark of the administration, while others departed at the start of summer.\n\nBut Biden’s inner circle remains mostly intact. That includes chief of staff Ron Klain, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, deputy chiefs of staff Bruce Reed and Jen O’Malley Dillon, communications director Kate Bedingfield and top communications adviser Anita Dunn.\n\nOfficials have said changes are possible both to the president’s Cabinet and his senior White House staff later this year, though no moves are guaranteed. Should Biden announce his decision to run in 2024, several of the members of his core team are considered likely to shift over to the political operation.\n\nEarlier this fall, the White House established a talent search project to prepare for potential vacancies across Cabinet and senior administration roles following the midterm elections.\n\nKlain brought forward the talent search idea, which will be overseen by two Biden White House alums, Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian. The pair served in similar roles during the 2020 presidential transition.\n\n“It’s just good government to make sure that you’re thinking ahead,” O’Malley Dillon said during an Axios event last week. “The people that are part of this and helping make that change are the people that you’d expect, and you want to see.”\n\nZients and Quillian – who both served in Covid-19 response roles at the White House earlier in Biden’s presidential term – have specifically been conducting a wide and diverse search for prospective candidates outside the administration to fill Cabinet, deputy Cabinet and senior administration roles.\n\nSome top officials, like Covid adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, are preparing to leave soon. Climate envoy John Kerry has told CNN he plans to stay in the administration at least until this week’s major climate conference in Egypt – without indicating whether he’ll stay longer. And Biden recently appointed a seasoned veteran of Democratic White Houses, John Podesta, to serve as his climate adviser.\n\nThe future of other officials is unclear. Klain has been the subject of speculation, and it is typical for White House chiefs of staff to serve only a portion of a president’s term. But as Biden faces the inevitable personnel transition that all presidents experience after the midterms, Klain’s deeply ingrained role in all corners of the West Wing’s operations may create even more incentive for him to stick around, some officials note, even as they acknowledge he’s given no indication of his intentions.\n\nA potential replacement has been floated in Dunn, who would be the first woman to serve in the role.\n\n“I like the job I have,” Dunn insisted at the Axios event. She added, “I hope Ron Klain stays as long as Joe Biden is president.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/politics/republicans-inflation-midterm-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Here's how Republicans would address inflation | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

The cost of service. It’s all having a cumulative effect. And wage hikes haven’t kept pace with inflation.\n\n$1,000 for a day at Disney. A more specific example that affects people fortunate enough to consider a vacation is the fact that a family of four will now spend more than $1,000 for a single day parking their car and park hopping at Disneyland. And that’s before food or souvenirs, according to CNN’s Natasha Chen.\n\nTide turning. Aggravating and persistent inflation that refuses, so far, to be tamed by interest rate hikes, remains a motivating force in American politics. And the sour economic mood is tilting the political landscape toward Republicans, according to CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta.\n\n“The nation’s overall political mood – which had been somewhat more favorable for Democrats following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade – may be tilting more in Republicans’ favor,” Agiesta writes.\n\nWhat would Republicans do? It’s worth considering how the economy will be different with Republicans in charge of the House or Senate.\n\nRepublicans on the campaign trail have tried to capitalize on the ongoing sticker shock and laid primary blame for inflation on government spending, an argument that overlooks the energy spike caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine and the supply chain issues caused by the lingering Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHere’s an extended riff from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – who is in line to be speaker of the House next year if Republicans win in November – when he appeared on Fox on Tuesday:\n\n“Every American needs to be asked this one question: ‘Could you afford to give up one month of your wages?’ Ninety-five percent of Americans will say no. But that’s what the Democrats have taken from you. Because one month of your wages is 8.3% of your overall year – inflation is higher than that.\n\nThat’s why when you go to the store, eggs are higher. You‘ve got milk higher, your gasoline prices higher. It is the Democrat policies that brought that. That’s why in the Commitment to America, we will be energy independent, that lower your prices. We’ll take away this runaway spending. We’ll make America more productive to curve inflation, what the Democrats have brought us.”\n\nThat’s the pitch. Can they deliver?\n\nControlling the House and/or Senate would certainly give Republicans the ability to squash any more spending pushed by the Biden administration. And for an idea of what they support, check out McCarthy’s Commitment to America website. It contains few specifics, but has three basic tenets:\n\n“Curb wasteful government spending …”\n\nEnact “pro-growth tax and deregulatory policies …” (cut taxes and regulations)\n\n“Make America energy independent …” (specifically through oil and gas production)\n\nRegarding the tax and regulation ideas, those are longer-term ideas since they would require a Republican president.\n\nA fourth promise to end reliance on China and ease supply chain problems does not include specific policy ideas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, for his part, has partially wrapped independence from China and building up US manufacturing into his climate policy, and on Wednesday announced $2.8 billion in grants for US battery supply chains under authority from the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed last year.\n\nHow far could Republicans go to cut spending?\n\nMcCarthy has suggested Republicans will go further and even use the debt ceiling, which will likely be reached early next year, as leverage to force spending cuts. It’s a more overt endorsement of the tactic, which would theoretically see the US default on its obligations.\n\nFor an assessment of what Republicans can and would be able to accomplish on inflation, I talked to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit organization that does not endorse policy positions but has a center-right viewpoint. He’s a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and was the economic policy adviser to Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, but he’s not affiliated with either party.\n\nControlling inflation is primarily the Fed’s job\n\nThe first thing to know, Holtz-Eakin said, is that the primary job of controlling inflation belongs to the Federal Reserve, not Congress or the White House.\n\nHowever, he’s of the opinion – along with other economists like the Democrat Larry Summers – that government spending, and in particular the American Rescue Plan Act passed without help from Republicans shortly after Biden took office, helped drive inflation.\n\n“Not committing the same mistake is something Republicans can control, there’s no doubt about it,” he said. “They can block things if they control the House, and that would be beneficial” to curb spending.\n\nThe proof that spending helped spur inflation\n\nWhile Holtz-Eakin said it is not accurate to say Biden and Democrats created the inflation, they certainly helped accelerate it.\n\n“It’s quite clear in the data that there’s a sharp ramp up of inflation in April of 2021 immediately as the checks go out, to implement a $2 trillion stimulus in our economy,” he said.\n\nWhat about using the debt ceiling as leverage to cut spending?\n\n“We’ve seen this movie a million times before,” Holtz-Eakin said, rattling off various ideas that have been put forward to control deficit spending and the national debt.\n\n“People have talked on both sides of this forever, and there hasn’t been one difference in the outcomes,” he said. The debt has gone up steadily. It is currently set at nearly $31.4 trillion.

But no one really had an agenda to do anything about it,” said Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a free market think tank, and former chief economist for Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. “I think ultimately, they’re going to be pointing fingers at each other while they wait for the Federal Reserve to do most of the heavy lifting.”\n\nHouse Republican leaders provided some big-picture ideas of their economic plans in their legislative agenda, titled Commitment to America, which they released in September. Many are core GOP ideals: They promise to curb wasteful spending, reduce taxes and regulations, ramp up American energy production, expand US manufacturing and move supply chains away from China.\n\nHowever, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who is in line to become House speaker next year, may have difficulty garnering enough support to pass any economic proposals with such a narrow majority, Riedl said. The caucus is currently split between economic nationalists, who want to increase tariffs, reduce immigration and crack down on trade, and free-market supporters, who champion spending cuts, tax reductions, free trade and less regulation.\n\nThe only significant overlap between the factions is their interest in increasing energy production, though that would not swiftly or significantly bring down the prices of oil, natural gas and gasoline, he said.\n\nStop Democrats’ spending proposals\n\nThere is one thing House Republicans can do that they believe will help the economy: Slam the brakes on Biden’s and congressional Democrats’ big spending proposals, which the GOP argues has caused inflation to soar.\n\n“We’ll pursue an agenda focused on affordability,” Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters Wednesday. “That means less government spending, taxes and regulation that is fueling higher prices, more made-in-America energy, more workers reconnected to their job and innovation that can reduce the drivers of inflation.”\n\nSoon after Biden took office last year, Democrats passed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill that provided another round of stimulus checks, extended generous unemployment benefits, temporarily beefed up the child tax credit and enhanced federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage, among other measures. Over the summer, the party passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill – a much smaller version of a $3.5 trillion package Democrats had originally hoped to push through.\n\nSeveral other spending measures got bipartisan support, including a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that passed last November and a bill that will invest more than $200 billion over five years to boost semiconductor chip manufacturing, which was approved over the summer.\n\nIt’s very hard to take all this money out of the system, so it just needs to work its way through, said Rohit Kumar, co-leader, Washington National Tax Services at PwC, and former deputy chief of staff for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. Most of the GOP’s economic policies are rooted in longer-term growth proposals, such as corporate tax incentives. In the short run, inflationary pressures will largely be handled by the Federal Reserve, though the GOP will seek to stop pouring more federal funds into the economy.\n\nIt’s possible the party will use the need to raise the debt ceiling sometime next year as leverage to force Biden and Democrats to curtail spending.\n\nBut if the economy does fall into a recession, cutting spending could make things worse, especially when the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates, said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments. Typically, providing targeted federal assistance to struggling Americans during downturns helps both them and the economy get back on their feet.\n\n“This mood on Capitol Hill against spending is not designed, in my opinion, to help the economy,” he said. “I think it could weaken the economy.”\n\nEconomic improvement\n\nAlthough prices for gas, food and other essentials remain high, inflation has cooled a bit in recent months. Wholesale prices rose by 8% in October from a year before, the smallest increase since July of last year, and the Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, the lowest annual inflation reading since January.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said Monday that it could soon be time for the central bank to slow the pace of its rate increases. It has approved hikes of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of its last four meetings in an effort to curb inflation.\n\nThere’s no panacea for the nation’s economic and inflation woes, Valliere said.\n\n“Everybody’s probably hoping that the economy heals by itself,” he said.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html", "title": "Stocks week ahead: How the midterms could affect Wall Street ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nLast week was a volatile one on Wall Street, with stocks falling after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell dashed the market’s dreams of a pivot and suggested that more big rate hikes are likely coming. But Wall Street is still turning its hopes to Washington.\n\nInvestors are betting on a big Republican wave in the midterm elections. If Republicans take at least one chamber of Congress in Tuesday’s midterm election, that will likely result in more gridlock, which the market usually loves.\n\nAccording to data from Edelman Financial Engines, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of 16.9% since 1948 during the nine years when a Democrat was in the White House and Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress. That compares to 15.1% during periods of full Democratic control and 15.9% in years when there was a unified GOP government.\n\nInvestors are more than happy when politicians bicker but don’t actually enact any new laws that may hurt corporate profits.\n\nForget about taxes\n\nOne example is taxes on businesses.\n\n“What do midterms mean for the markets? If Republicans get the House, tax hikes are dead in the water,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager with Aptus Capital Advisors. Republicans may be less likely to approve a windfall tax on oil company profits and also are generally not in favor of tax hikes on the wealthy.\n\nThe market also is betting that some sectors could get a boost – even if Republicans take control of the House or Senate and presumably make it more difficult for President Biden to get laws passed.\n\nThat’s because there are some areas of consensus for the White House and Republican lawmakers.\n\n“A GOP sweep could lead to more spending on defense,” said Wagner. “Increasing the budget for defense seems to be a bipartisan issue.” The House passed a record high defense budget proposal this summer.\n\nBiden and Republicans also seem to be on the same page when it comes to boosting spending on infrastructure. That could give a boost to utilities, construction companies and some real estate stocks. Congress did pass a more than $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill last year that was championed by President Biden after all. But it’s not yet clear what the appetite for more spending is…even if there is consensus that more is needed.\n\n“Everything is polarized politically, but there has been common ground on infrastructure. That was even the case with [Donald] Trump and [Hillary] Clinton in 2016,” said Jim Lydotes, deputy chief investment officer of equities at Newton Investment Management. “As a country we’ve under-invested in infrastructure. That’s an area where there is a lot of agreement.”\n\nGridlock isn’t always a good thing\n\nOf course, there is no guarantee that Biden and other Democratic leaders will be able to work effectively with Republicans in Congress. After all, the political narrative will quickly shift to the 2024 presidential race once the midterms are in the rear view mirror. Congress and the White House may spend more time bickering than trying to pass legislation.\n\nThere also may be some significant drawbacks to a divided government, especially if fears of a recession come to fruition next year.\n\nRob Dent, US senior economist at Nomura Securities International, said there could be less federal government spending on social safety net programs if Republicans take control of Congress.\n\n“All else being equal, that could lead to a longer recovery from a recession,” Dent said. That would be bad for stocks more generally since consumer spending drives corporate profits.\n\nDent added that there’s also the unwelcome possibility of more bickering in Washington about the debt ceiling. The last time that was a major issue was during President Barack Obama’s first term. The US lost its prized perfect AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor’s as a result of the debt ceiling drama. The stock market plunged more than 5% after the downgrade happened in August 2011.\n\n“This election outcome is less about what might get done versus what might not get done to help the economy during a downturn,” Dent said. “We’re worried about divided government leading to brinkmanship about the debt limit and the potential for government shutdowns. We haven’t had to deal with that in quite some time.”\n\nBut at the end of the day, political headlines are often just noise for the markets. Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene said on a conference call last week about the midterms that stocks have historically gone up after elections, no matter which party controls the White House and Congress.\n\nThe midterms may also take a “back seat” to other macro issues. Saglimbene noted that “growth, profits, inflation and interest rates” matter more to investors over the long haul. He conceded that election results could lead to more near-term volatility, but that the market is already pricing in a strong likelihood of divided government.\n\nInflation nation\n\nPolitically-induced market and economic volatility is the last thing that consumers, investors or the Fed need given that inflation has turned out to not be transitory as Fed chair Powell had predicted for much of 2021.\n\nIt is clear that higher prices for commodities and other raw materials, shipping and other transportation expenses and labor costs are not going away anytime soon.\n\nSteve Cahillane, the CEO of cereal and snack food giant Kellogg (K), even said on the company’s most recent earnings call last week that the thought that “inflation was going to be transitory was always obviously ridiculous.”\n\nWe’ll get a better sense of just how persistent inflation is on Thursday after the government reports the September consumer price index (CPI) figures.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Reuters are forecasting that overall prices rose 0.7% last month, up from a 0.4% gain in September. That would likely push year-over-year prices, which rose 8.2% over the past 12 months through September, even higher as well. The continued strength of the jobs market will put more pressure on prices too.\n\n“The labor market is resilient and inflation is spreading to the services sector, too,” said Troy Gayeski, chief investment strategist with FS Investments.\n\nThat may lead to more worries that the economy may be headed for a so-called stagflation environment, a period where stagnant growth occurs alongside high inflation.

But it’s being pushed to the last minute as the routine disputes between Republicans and Democrats over spending priorities are exacerbated by conservative Republicans who want to hold key decisions until the new Congress in January, when they hope to use their new House majority to cut spending.\n\nIt’s an early glimpse of the paralysis that could result from divided government with neither side having the power to fully deliver on promises they made to voters in last month’s midterm elections, when Republicans won the House and Democrats retained control of the Senate.\n\nSome of these clashes, like disputes over funding social programs and the need to raise the government’s borrowing limit next year, threaten to shut the government or badly damage the US economy. This heralds a return of the government shutdown threats that were a regular holiday season tradition during the Obama administration after Republicans gained congressional majorities. And during Donald Trump’s administration, the government shut down for 35 days over the 2018-19 holiday season because of a dispute over the then-president’s demand for border wall funding – leaving federal workers furloughed and putting critical programs and services on hold.\n\nThis time, Republicans, especially in the House, believe that they have a mandate from voters to stem domestic spending on issues like Covid-19, climate change and other priorities that have characterized President Joe Biden’s administration. And even though Democrats control the House until the end of the post-election lame duck session, muscle-flexing GOP lawmakers want to use their new power now.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, understand that the government spending bill likely represents their last chance to enact Biden’s ambitious domestic plans until the next presidential election. The fraught final weeks of 2022 may also be their best opening to bypass the incoming GOP House by honoring Biden’s $37 billion request for new aid for Ukraine, which some conservatives oppose and which could be added to the government spending bill. Democratic leaders say the omnibus bill is urgently needed to fund police departments, to ease congestion at ports and to improve medical care for veterans and to help the US compete with China, among scores of other priorities. But Republicans argue domestic non-defense spending has already had a huge boost in Biden’s Covid-19 rescue measures and in his new climate and health care law.\n\nThe chances of a deal in the coming weeks hang in the balance and are creating a conflict between the need for good governance and politics – one that is usually resolved in bitterly divided Washington in favor of the latter force. The year-end government spending showdown – a classic example of Congress’ tendency to put off tough decisions until the last possible moment – is also being complicated by the need to pass the $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed a version of the measure last week after ending Covid-19 vaccination mandates in the military in order to draw Republican votes.\n\nRepublicans’ grim prognosis for a deal with Democrats\n\nIn a sign of rising political pressure over the spending clash, a group of Republican senators wrote to GOP leader Mitch McConnell last week, laying out their strategy and urging him to block a big spending bill and to agree to a short-term funding package to keep the government open for a few weeks.\n\n“For the Senate to ram through a so-called ‘omnibus’ bill—which would fund the entirety of the Pelosi-Schumer spending agenda through most of next year—would utterly disempower the new Republican House from enacting our shared priorities,” said the letter signed by six senators including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nTheir stance helps explain why McConnell last week gave a grim prognosis for a deal with Democrats on a big funding bill, commenting, “We don’t have agreements to do virtually anything. … We don’t even have an overall agreement on how much we’re going to spend, and we’re running out of time.”\n\nThere is one school of thought that the passage of a long-term funding mechanism might actually give House GOP leaders a break since a short-term deal would raise the possibility that one of the first acts of a new majority would be to trigger a government shutdown – a state of affairs that has often been politically damaging to the reputation of the party saddled with the blame. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is already under fierce pressure from the most radical members of his conference as he struggles to get enough votes to become speaker. He has little political leeway and has therefore been heaping public pressure on Senate Republicans to thwart Biden’s hopes of one more spending package, saying on Fox News earlier this month that once Republicans have the gavel in the House, “We would be stronger in every negotiation.”\n\nHis comments, while offering a glimpse of how he plans to preside over a confrontation with the White House, also offered insight into how the GOP House could make McConnell’s life more complicated next year as he tries to manage his party in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats are keen for one last show of power\n\nDemocrats are determined to get a government funding bill passed in the final days of their party’s House majority and are also gearing up for the battles that will unfold at the beginning of next year.\n\nIf lawmakers cannot agree on a deal, they will face the possibility of either passing a short-term spending bill to carry the debate into the new Congress or a longer-term continuing resolution that would extend current spending levels.\n\nBut a senior Biden administration official warned last week that even a funding deal that lasted a year would have “disastrous” consequences for key programs.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, implied that Republicans were trying to jam Democrats at the end of this year to kickstart their effort in the new GOP House to slash spending on vital social programs.\n\n“Republicans see it as an opportunity to hold us hostage and get demands that, under normal circumstances, they would not,” Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“Look, they have not been shy about making it clear they want to cut Social Security, they want to cut Medicare, they want to cut Medicaid,” Sanders told Dana Bash.\n\nBiden sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin up to Capitol Hill last week to brief senators on the war in Ukraine. But in a sign of the consuming nature of the spending showdown, Republicans emerged from the meeting complaining that the two secretaries spent time lobbying for an omnibus spending bill over a continuing resolution.\n\n“It was a waste of their time. It was a waste of our time,” Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy told reporters. He said that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had asked Blinken and Austin to explain why the new spending bill was so necessary. “I knew as soon as Chuck said that. … this is just a political exercise,” Kennedy said.\n\nGiven the gulf between Democrats and Republicans who would be needed to back a spending deal in the Senate, it is increasingly likely that Congress may have to pass an ultra-short term measure to get past Friday’s deadline to allow for an extension in negotiations that would push lawmakers ever closer to the holidays.\n\n“Bring your Yuletide carols and all that stuff here because we may be singing to each other,” South Dakota Sen.

A bipartisan group of senators is engaging in talks in an attempt to find common ground on gun policy, but it is still unclear what, if anything, will come of the effort. Passage of the legislation also took place hours after an emotional hearing on gun violence in which families of victims pleaded for more action.\n\nThe legislation that passed in the House includes a series of individual bills aimed at preventing gun violence. The measure would raise the legal age to buy certain semiautomatic centerfire rifles from 18 to 21 years old, establish new federal offenses for gun trafficking and for selling large-capacity magazines, and allow local governments to compensate individuals who surrender such magazines through a buyback program. It would create a tax incentive for retail sales of safe storage devices and criminal penalties for breaking new requirements regulating firearm storage on residential premises. The measure would also take steps to strengthen existing federal regulations on bump stocks and ghost guns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Spare me the bulls***': Democratic lawmaker fires back at GOP during hearing 02:45 - Source: CNN\n\n“We are on a crusade for the children, and – sadly now – by the children.

Around 770,000 people will be affected by the change, according to an administration official.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action as long as the borrower consolidated his or her debt into the federal Direct loan program.\n\nOn Thursday, the department reversed course. According to its website, privately held federal student loans must have been consolidated before September 29 in order to be eligible for the debt relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans who have not consolidated yet are currently out of luck, though the Department of Education said it “is assessing whether there are alternative pathways” to provide relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans represent a small portion of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers. There are about 4 million borrowers with Federal Family Education Loans, but not all of those people are likely eligible for the loan forgiveness plan, which also includes an income requirement.\n\n“Our goal is to provide relief to as many eligible borrowers as quickly and easily as possible, and this will allow us to achieve that goal while we continue to explore additional legally-available options to provide relief to borrowers with privately owned FFEL loans and Perkins loans, including whether FFEL borrowers could receive one-time debt relief without needing to consolidate,” the Department of Education said in an emailed statement.\n\n“Borrowers with privately held federal student loans who applied to consolidate their loans into Direct Loans before September 29, 2022 will obtain one-time debt relief. The FFEL program is now defunct and only a small percentage of borrowers have FFEL loans. This is a completely different program than Direct Loans,” the statement said.\n\nLawsuit argues forgiveness will hurt loan servicers\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Missouri by state attorneys general from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina, as well as legal representatives from Iowa.\n\n“In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration’s Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed,” Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson’s office said in a news release.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that student loan servicers – including the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri, known as MOHELA – are harmed by Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. It argues that the plan creates an incentive for borrowers to consolidate Federal Family Education Loans owned by MOHELA into Direct Loans owned by the government, “depriving them (MOHELA) of the ongoing revenue it earns from servicing those loans,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nBut the Department of Education’s move to exclude borrowers with privately held federal loans from the student loan forgiveness plan could weaken that legal argument, said Luke Herrine, an assistant law professor at the University of Alabama who previously worked on a legal strategy pushing for student debt cancellation.\n\nThe White House continues to argue that its student loan forgiveness plan is legal.\n\n“Republican officials from these six states are standing with special interests, and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt,”said White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan in an emailed statement.\n\n“The President and his administration are lawfully giving working and middle class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January,” he said.\n\nFederal student loan payments have been paused since March 2020, thanks to a pandemic-related benefit. The pause expires on December 31.\n\nEarlier this week, a public interest lawyer who is also a student loan borrower, sued the Biden administration over the student loan forgiveness plan, arguing that the policy is an abuse of executive power and that it would stick him with a bigger state tax bill.\n\nHow Biden’s plan will work\n\nUnder Biden’s plan, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors that include their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nThe administration is expected to roll out the first wave of student loan forgiveness in October.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated this week – before the administration excluded FFEL borrowers – that Biden’s plan could cost the government $400 billion but warned that the estimate relies on several assumptions and is “highly uncertain.”\n\nEstimating the cost of student debt forgiveness is complicated because loans are generally paid back over several years. The White House argues that the CBO’s estimate should be looked at over a 30-year time frame.\n\nUntested legal waters\n\nBiden announced the forgiveness plan in August, after facing mounting pressure from Democrats to forgive some student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeatedly called on the President to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower.\n\nBut canceling federal student loan debt so broadly is unprecedented and, until now, has yet to be tested in court. Biden initially urged Congress to take action to cancel some student debt, rather than wade into a murky legal area himself, but Democrats don’t have the votes to pass such legislation.\n\nIn a Department of Education memo released in August, the Biden administration argued that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – or Heroes Act – grants the Education Secretary the power to cancel student debt to help address the financial harm suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Heroes Act, which was enacted in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, “provides the Secretary broad authority to grant relief from student loan requirements during specific periods,” including a war, other military operation or national emergency, according to the memo.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday argues that the Heroes Act does not grant the President such broad authority.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nAdditional lawsuits challenging Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be forthcoming. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, has said he is working on developing the best legal theory to sue the administration over the action.\n\nA conservative advocacy group called the Job Creators Network is also weighing its legal options, planning to file a lawsuit once the Department of Education formalizes the student loan forgiveness plan next month.\n\nBut some legal experts are skeptical that a legal challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be successful.\n\nAbby Shafroth, staff attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center, previously told CNN that she believes the merits of the Biden administration’s legal statutory authority are strong and that it’s unclear who would have legal standing to bring a case and want to do so. Standing to bring a case is a procedural threshold requiring that an injury be inflicted on a plaintiff to justify a lawsuit.\n\nIf the standing hurdle is cleared, a case would be heard by a district court first – which may or may not issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the cancellation from occurring before a final ruling is issued on the merits of the hypothetical case.\n\nSeveral recent US Supreme Court decisions have touched on executive power, limiting the federal government’s authority to implement new rules. While the Supreme Court takes up a small number of cases each year, lower courts may look at what the justices have said in those cases when assessing the Department of Education’s authority.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/16/washington-congress-news-live-updates/11266601002/", "title": "Recap: Biden says aerial objects 'most likely' private balloons", "text": "President Joe Biden said Thursday the administration continues to study a series of unidentified flying objects shot down in recent days but that intelligence officials increasingly believe they were benign balloons used for research or commercial purposes.\n\nBiden said the intelligence community's current assessment is that three objects shot down over North American airspace were \"most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions.\" That does not include the Chinese spy balloon the U.S military shot down in early February.\n\nAlso, parts of the long-awaited report by a Georgia grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump and his allies were released Thursday.

Along with your right to choose and the right to privacy.\"\n\nBiden has spent the final days of an uphill midterm campaign for Democrats imploring that modern-day Republicans are uniquely dangerous – willing to destroy democracy to gain power, ban abortion nationally, cut Social Security and Medicare and, if they don't get their way on entitlements, crash the economy by forcing the government into default.\n\nMore:Amid midterm voting, Biden warns of 'chaos,' fears of political violence ahead of Nov. 8 election\n\nIn his closing argument to halt Republican momentum before Tuesday's election, Biden has painted a dark picture of a possible \"mega MAGA Republican\" Congress. \"This ain't your father's Republican Party,\" he's stressed repeatedly, focusing less on his own accomplishments and more on the intentions of his opponents.\n\nYet there are serious doubts, including among Democrats, whether Biden's doomsday portrayal of Republicans has broken through as stubborn inflation and pocketbook issues weigh on voters. Some in the party say Democrats should have touched more on economic concerns earlier in the campaign and less about restoring abortion rights, which dominated Democratic ads for much of the race, in part on the advice of the \"governing consulting class.\"\n\n\"That was a mistake,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., arguing Democrats should compare Biden's efforts to bring manufacturing jobs home versus Republicans who want tax cuts for corporations. \"I've been saying for months that we need to frame this election as an economic choice.\"\n\nMore:As midterms loom, what's shaping undecided voters' opinions in 5 charts\n\nTo defy headwinds of 40-year high inflation and the historical trend of midterm losses for the party in the White House, Biden has tried to appeal to undecided voters by arguing \"this is no ordinary year.\"\n\n\"So, I ask you to think long and hard about the moment we're in,\" Biden said in a primetime speech last week. \"In a typical year, we're often not faced with questions of whether the vote we cast will preserve democracy or put us at risk.\"\n\nBut there's an underlying challenge with Biden's depiction of a Republican takeover, according to Lynn Vavreck, professor of American Politics and Public Policy at UCLA: many voters remember previous periods of Republican power in Congress not being especially catastrophic.\n\n\"It's sort of like saying, 'Trust me, this time it'll be really different if they take over. The country will never be the same,'\" Vavreck said. \"It's a lot of hyperbole. And you're asking voters to believe something that the past suggests may not be true.\"\n\nHow Biden has tried to defy midterm gravity\n\nRepublicans are widely favored to gain control of at the House, according to most analysts, and have an increasingly stronger outlook to take the Senate, with races in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and a few other battlegrounds deciding control. Some Democrats have openly discussed fears of a \"red wave\" election that would deliver a party still dominated by Donald Trump sweeping victories.\n\nRepublican control of even one legislative body would be enough to block Biden's legislative agenda on taxes, abortion, voting reforms and other priorities. If Republicans take over both chambers, only Biden's veto pen would stand in the way of the GOP passing a host of conservative laws.\n\nMore:Schumer captured on hot mic telling Biden that Georgia Senate race is 'going downhill' for Democrats\n\nRepublican candidates have focused their attacks against Democrats on crime in cities, migrants at the southern border and, above all, inflation that's at 8.2% over last year – even as corporate profits hit a 70-year high. Robert Gibbs, who served as press secretary in the Obama White House, said the \"here and now\" of inflation has made Biden's warnings about a GOP takeover hard to stick.\n\n\"It's just tough to make the argument of 'if these guys get into power, here's the things they'll end up doing' versus, 'hey, bread was really expensive in Aisle 4,'\" said Gibbs, speaking on the podcast hosted by former Obama advisor David Axelrod.\n\nTuesday's election is the first national election since the Jan.6 assault on the U.S. Capitol led by Trump supporters. It's also the first election since the Supreme Court's decision in June that struck down abortion rights.\n\n\"This election is not a referendum. It's a choice,\" Biden has said frequently in a push to make the race not about his popularity, with approval ratings in the low 40s, but instead Democrats' vision versus Trumpism.\n\nMore:As recession fears weigh on midterms, Biden warns Republicans will 'crash the economy' if they win control\n\nIn a final gasp to blunt Republicans' polling edge on the economy, Biden has taken aim at House Republican leaders who have suggested they might use the debt ceiling as \"leverage\" to achieve their goals on Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"Now they’ve come forward with a real ticking time bomb. This one is outrageous, \" Biden said in Hallandale Beach, Florida. \"Nothing will create more chaos and do more damage to the American economy than playing around with whether we pay our national bills.\"\n\nSecond-guessing begins\n\nFor much of the summer, Democrats outperformed expectations in midterm polling and in congressional special elections, a sign that women and suburban voters were motivated by restoring abortion rights.\n\nBut the dynamics appeared to shift about a month ago. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll taken Oct. 19 to Oct. 24 found 37% of likely midterm voters ranked inflation as their top concern, compared with 18% who said abortion.\n\nMore:Exclusive poll: Republican support rises ahead of Election Day, with inflation driving voters\n\nDemocratic ads haven't reflected that trend, however. Democratic candidates and the party's outside groups have spent a combined $424 million in advertising this election cycle focused on abortion, about eight times the $53 million spent on economic-themed ads, according to AdImpact, a media tracking firm.\n\nSome Democrats are second-guessing that decision.\n\n\"We're getting crushed on narrative,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in an interview with CBS, arguing Democrats leaned too much into abortion rights, allowing Republicans to win the \"messaging war.\" He said he worries about a red wave Tuesday. \"You feel it,\" Newsom said.\n\nCraig Varoga, a longtime Democratic strategist for congressional races, said, \"If we have made any kind of mistake, it's the fact that we haven't talked about all of these assaults on American freedom.\" He pointed to Democrats' siloed messages on abortion, the economy, and threats to democracy. \"We probably should have done a better job of pulling it all together.\"\n\nBiden's speech on democracy at risk was widely viewed as a play to the Democratic base.\n\n\"Number one, he absolutely believes it. And number two, it's a motivator to get Democrats out to vote,\" said veteran Democratic strategist Bob Shrum.\n\nMore:Inflation, health care and rent: key economic factors voters consider in midterms\n\nBut some progressives questioned whether another speech on democracy – his second on the topic in two months – was the right move.\n\n\"If you're going to vote on democracy and the frailty of democracy, if you're going to vote on abortion, a lot of those people have made their decision,\" Faiz Shakir, an adviser to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said in an appearance on MSNBC. \"The persuasion audience, the people who haven't decided, they are all in on economy.\"\n\nSidelined from most battlegrounds states\n\nBiden is a full-contact campaigner, known for hugging supporters, telling stories about life in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and giving fiery speeches about the little guy.\n\nBut he's not been at the center of action this cycle.\n\n\"Hello, New Mexico,\" Biden said last week from a community in Albuquerque New Mexico, hardly ground zero for the midterm campaign despite having one competitive congressional race.\n\nSaddled by low approval ratings, Biden has avoided most battleground Senates states, making no trips in the final weeks to Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire or appearances with its Democratic Senate nominees. An exception is Pennsylvania, where Biden has roots and Senate nominee John Fetterman has needed help to turn out Black voters.\n\nBiden and former President Barack Obama joined Fetterman for a rally Saturday in Philadelphia. But typically, it's just been Obama, alone, as Democrats' chief-stumper in the bulk of states that will decide Senate control.\n\nObama, speaking Wednesday in Phoenix, lambasted the Republican \"cast of characters\" running in Arizona.\n\n\"If you've got an election denier serving as your governor, as your senator, as your secretary of state, as your attorney general, then democracy, as we know it, may not survive in Arizona,\" Obama said.\n\nBiden's 2024 planning underway\n\nA Republican takeover of the House would significantly impede what the White House can pass legislatively for the next two years, perhaps forcing Biden to turn more to executive authority on climate, guns and other areas.\n\nIt could also open the door to investigations into the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, which House Republicans have openly discussed, and build pressure from Trump-aligned House Republicans to impeach Joe Biden.\n\nDemocrats dread the thought.\n\n\"There will be no governing in the House if Republicans take over,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico. \"I'm pretty apocalyptic about what the House will look like if Marjorie Taylor Green is in charge. It's an absolute nightmare if Republicans win.\"\n\nA Republican takeover of the Senate and House would be widely interpreted as a repudiation of the Biden presidency, fueling more questions about whether Biden will seek reelection in 2024. Biden has said it's his \"intention\" to run but hasn't formally announced a bid.\n\nMore:Outnumbered Republican women raise cash to combat well-funded Democrats on Election Day\n\nBehind the scenes, the president has started to prepare for a reelection campaign in meetings this fall with a small team of his most trusted aides, according to a Biden adviser. Preliminary work, which has explored a Trump rematch and other potential Republican nominees, has included outreach to veterans of Obama's and Bill Clinton's reelection campaigns.\n\n\"If we weren't engaged in planning in November of this year, we should be in the political malpractice hall of fame,\" Anita Dunn, one of Biden's closest advisers, said at a recent discussion hosted by Axios.\n\nMore:The question Democrats keep struggling with: Should Biden run again in 2024?\n\nIt's unclear when Biden will make a decision on 2024, but Biden could face pressure from Democrats to announce his intentions quickly if Democrats lose Congress and Trump enters the race, as he's indicated he will.\n\nAssociates of Trump said they expect the former president to announce his candidacy shortly after Tuesday's Election Day.\n\nAn early announcement this month by Trump wouldn't affect Biden's timing on a 2024 decision, according to people in Biden's orbit.\n\nAlthough a midterm loss for a second-year president would follow the historical norm, Biden's circumstances are different than his predecessors: Biden, already the oldest serving president, will turn 80 on Nov. 20. Some members of his own party have said he should serve only one term. And Biden himself has left the door open that he might pass on another run.\n\nStill, those who know Biden insist Democratic losses Tuesday wouldn't influence his decision.\n\n\"Look, I've known him for almost 50 years.

Or, perhaps more aptly, a DeppTok influencer.\n\nSophie Doggett, whose TikTok was previously populated by videos on everyday things such as herself or her pets, posted to her TikTok account on April 25 a clip of Heard’s lawyer asking a question of a witness and then immediately objecting to the response. It is one of many moments in the trial that has been seized upon by people like Doggett, as clips of testimony and references to the case have pervaded TikTok in a way that no trial has before. That’s partly because the proceeding, set to resume Monday, is being livestreamed during the age of TikTok, and also because of the high-profile celebrities the case involves.\n\nDoggett, who paired the clip to playful music, said she gained 30,000 followers seemingly overnight from the post which has, to date, been viewed more than 5 million times. Asked about her follower count before the viral post, she says it was 6,668, a number she recites by heart. In the three weeks since the post, she’s collected more than 25,000 additional followers. Her account is now dedicated to Depp-related posts, some of which pertain to the trial, others to past Depp films or interviews. The top three posts pinned to Doggett’s account have more than 14 million collective views.\n\nIf there’s any question of where her loyalty lies, it is with Depp, something that’s conveyed through the photo associated with her TikTok account — white text against a black background that reads “Justice for Johnny Depp.”\n\nInside the courtroom, jurors are tasked with determining whether Depp was falsely and maliciously accused of domestic abuse by Heard, which he claims cost him an estimated $50 million in damages associated with lost acting jobs. The case stems from a 2018 opinion piece published in The Washington Post wherein Heard described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” Although Depp is not named in the piece, Heard refers to the year 2016, a year in which she filed for a divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, claiming she’d been abused.\n\nTikTok creators are leveraging hashtags like #JusticeforJohnnyDepp to show support for the actor while using others to mock actress Amber Heard. From TikTok\n\nDepp denied the allegations then, as he does now, and the two reached a divorce settlement that year, issuing a joint statement at the time. During his testimony, Depp alleged he was physically and verbally abused by Heard and denied accusations that he was physically violent toward her. Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, claiming statements his team made were damaging to her career\n\nOnline, however, everyone from everyday users like Doggett — who said she is now able to monetize her posts through TikTok’s creator fund due to the attention — to legal analysts, lifestyle influencers, activists of varying pursuits, and comedians are taking it upon themselves to dissect and analyze every minute detail of the trial, down to conspiracy theories about the way in which Heard dabbed her nose with a tissue.\n\nEmily D. Baker, a former LA deputy district attorney turned online creator, streams live legal commentary of the trial proceedings on her YouTube page, which has more than 330,000 subscribers. Her viewers increasingly request for her to respond to theories or footage they have seen on TikTok, she says.\n\n“When you have cameras streaming in the courtroom, people are going to clock every strange behavior. And they have,” said Baker.\n\nMany are in the comment sections on YouTube channels to cheer Depp or jeer Heard — typically in that order. Others have set up their own video broadcasts to provide ongoing commentary of the trial in real-time or devoted Instagram accounts to posting updates on the case. Perhaps most striking — because of the way in which the platform operates and how users take to it — is TikTok.\n\nLike Doggett, two other TikTok users CNN Business spoke with recounted similar stories of going from hundreds or thousands of followers to tens of thousands of followers in a matter of days due to Depp-related posts.\n\nOne TikTok user, who is based in the UK, said she posted a video on April 27 celebrating Depp for freeing his lawyer’s snagged charger cord with a comment, “the little things.” “I wasn’t expecting anyone to reach out, or like it, or share it even,” she said, noting that she’d originally created her account to post about films. But it has since garnered more than 10 million views. She’s continued posting about the trial and she says her account has gone from fewer than 300 followers to more than 50,000.\n\nMaria Pugsley, also based in the UK, similarly told CNN Business that followers to her account grew from fewer than 10,000 to more than 37,000. Previously, she said her use of TikTok included “jumping on the trends, really and having a bit of a laugh — it never really took off to be honest.”\n\nBut users have taken to her commentary on the trial, in which she favors Depp and has spoken about male victims of abuse. “In the beginning I went in very unbiased — all of my opinions are based on the courtroom,” she said, adding: “I am always open to having my opinion changed.”\n\nA high-profile trial, dissected on TikTok\n\nTikTok’s algorithm has been repeatedly reported upon as scary-good in its manner of feeding users more and more posts pertaining to their interests. One has to look no further than the hashtags on TikTok to gauge that sentiment there sways favorable toward the 58-year-old Depp, undoubtedly the bigger celebrity with a much longer history cultivating a fanbase compared to 36-year-old Heard. Doggett noted that she hadn’t personally come across posts on TikTok in support of Heard: “Maybe a couple people [in comments sections] saying ‘Team Amber.’ They get destroyed in the comments.”\n\nOne hashtag, #JusticeForJohnnyDepp, has garnered more than 11 billion views globally, while just the actor’s name has more than 19 billion, and #JohnnyDeppisInnocent has garnered more than 3 billion. Users are applying filters to their faces to personify Depp, combining clips of testimonies with past footage from Depp’s film archives. By contrast, #JusticeForAmberHeard has 41 million views. Heard’s name has garnered more than 9 billion views and #AmberTurd has 1.6 billion (a hashtag fueled by trial testimony concerning fecal matter.) Meanwhile, the #AmberHeardIsALiar had drawn more than 2 billion views when CNN Business reviewed it Friday afternoon, but the hashtag no longer appeared viewable in the app as of Friday evening.\n\n“What you’re seeing is fan base versus fan base,” Juda Engelmayer, a public relations professional who has worked with high-profile figures, such as disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein who was convicted for sex crimes, and is currently working with the fake heiress Anna Sorokin. “It was surprising to me that the social media throngs and supporters are almost entirely backing him.”\n\nThe passionate social media posts surrounding the case are, at times, rooted in other factors. Some see outsized support for Depp, and the dismissal of Heard’s allegations, as another example of internalized misogyny. Others, including men’s rights activists, have lifted up Depp in online forums as a rare well-known man who alleges he experienced domestic abuse at the hands of a woman, thereby bringing light to the issue.\n\nAccording to Daniel Klug, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University’s Institute for Software Research who has researched TikTok’s algorithm, “TikTok creates a sort of mediated reality for the user.”\n\n“Over a time period, you see a lot of short videos … depending on what kind of content you see, let’s say a lot of content about the trial, that creates a certain perception of the reality of the trial for you on TikTok,” he said, noting that posts tends to fall into two categories: those that capture testimonies from Heard, Depp, or others on the stand “describing very personal and intimate and weird details of their relationship,” or content related to Depp or the trial that is “remixed or reinterpreted by other users.”\n\nCallum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate which recently investigated abuse directed at several high-profile women, including Heard, on Instagram similarly noted that the nature of TikTok is such that “you get very, very slim segments of the trial presented and usually with a very heavy skew.”\n\n“This applies as much to [content posted about] Ukraine as clips of the Amber Heard, Johnny Depp trial,” said Hood, noting that “content on TikTok, more so than any other platform, is free of context … We tend to know less about the account that’s posting it, less about when it was posted, less about where the material is from, about the motivations of the person posting it … I’ve got a lot of sympathy for the users because it is genuinely very hard, with the information available to you in the app, to understand the context and to make an assessment of how true or false it is.”\n\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate’s report noted that discussions of Depp and Heard’s legal battles on social media “often contain abuse towards Heard, as well as the promotion of conspiracy theories around the rate of women’s false allegations of domestic abuse.”\n\nTrial-related content on TikTok varies from those who are analyzing and conspiracy theorizing to attempts to poke fun, which can quickly become distasteful. One popular variation of posts is based on satirical reenactments using audio from Heard’s testimony, in which she said, “I was walking out of the bedroom, [he] slapped me across the face and I turned to look at him and I said, ‘Johnny, you hit me. You just hit me.’” One widely-shared post, featured a cat role playing the former couple. It wears a blond wig when playing the part of Heard and a paper mustache and bandana when playing the part of Depp. While the original post is no longer viewable, it had been “dueted” by other accounts — a TikTok feature that enables users to post a video side-by-side one from another user in order to react to it — which can still be found on the platform.\n\nFor its part, TikTok said it removes content that violates its policies, which include “threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.” There may be some leeway in the case of Heard and Depp, as its community guidelines note that “critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.”\n\n“I believe I was mass reported over political differences”\n\nThere are also questions about whether and how others on the platform may be able to silence certain voices or opinions.\n\nOne TikTok user named Ashley, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, posted about how she felt some men’s rights activists were using the trial as an excuse to discredit allegations by women of abuse.\n\n“Can you imagine the leeway every narcissistic woman-hating man is going to have now?” she said in the post. Ashley told CNN Business that the post was quickly “dueted” and she received threats in the comments, then her account was banned.\n\nIn a message on April 26, Ashley — who is based in Pittsburgh and had 7,000 followers — asked TikTok to restore her account, “I believe I was mass reported over political differences,” she wrote, adding that she had screenshots of threatening messages she had received. Asked about her account by CNN Business last week, TikTok said it would investigate it. Following that, the company restored her account but did not provide any details on why.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/09/30/nick-cannon-brittany-bell-10-kids-why-we-so-bothered/8121608001/", "title": "Nick Cannon welcomed his twelfth child.

Yet his choice to father these children has been treated as comedic fodder while raising a plethora of concerns.\n\nRejecting traditional marriage:It's more common than you think.\n\nUntraditional families exist all around us every day.

Fox (\"I don't like it,\" she said in August. \"The foundation of Black families, especially a strong father figure is needed.\")\n\n\"The public loves to express their opinions, because it makes them feel like part of the story,\" says Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist and CEO and founder of \"Already Famous.\" \"When we see behavior outside the norm in the lives of celebrities, we shake our heads, pass judgments… and write it off as 'typical' celebrity entitlement.\"\n\nBut does this make our judgments justified?\n\n'Struggle love' is toxic:Why are we romanticizing it?\n\nIs there a problem with Nick Cannon's take on fatherhood?\n\nWhen asked about his emotional involvement as a father, Cannon has insisted \"if I'm not physically in the same city with my kids, I'm talking to them before they go to school via FaceTime and stuff. And then when I am, I'm driving my kids to school, making sure I pick them up.\"\n\nA quick scroll through his Instagram page exemplifies the love and pride he holds for his kids, and many of the mothers have praised Cannon's presence.\n\nThis fixation on his family is unsurprising to Rockwell. Any time someone in the public eye behaves in a way that deviates from the norm, like having many children from different households, \"we as the public hang onto every detail\" and treat it as gossip.\n\nBut aside from it being unconventional, some experts worry this dynamic is detrimental. If his 10 kids, ages 11 and younger, live in different households, many wonder how Cannon can possibly be there, physically and emotionally, for each child.\n\nNick Cannon makes vasectomy cocktail:with Ryan Reynolds after teasing he's having more kids\n\nBarbara La Pointe, a relationship coach who primarily works with families dealing with divorce and separation, worries the \"Wild 'n Out\" host is \"unconsciously creating a legacy of generational trauma.\" Though there is less research on Cannon's approach to fatherhood, studies have shown that a child's emotional well-being is influenced by a secure relationship with their parents, as well as by the quality of that relationship.\n\nIn addition, relationship strategist Zakiya Knighten worries for his children's mothers who, despite going into these relationships willingly, may also be at risk for higher stress levels and mental health problems. In a now-deleted Instagram story, one of Cannon's partners said she had been awake for three days taking care of their baby, raising questions on social media about Cannon's whereabouts.\n\nAre we being too judgmental of Nick Cannon?\n\nContrary to popular belief, Cannon is not the first celebrity to father multiple children with different women. Actor Clint Eastwood is thought to have 8 known children with 6 different women, his daughter told The Sunday Times. Similarly, Elon Musk has joked about \"(helping) the underpopulation crisis\" with his 10 children, two with singer Grimes, two with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Musk's Neuralink, and six with his first wife, Justine Wilson.\n\nThe difference, however, is that Cannon proudly embraces his lifestyle of nonconventional fatherhood and rejects traditional monogamy, even challenging those who are skeptical.\n\n\"That's a Eurocentric concept when you think about the ideas of you're supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,\" Cannon said in August. \"I understand the institution of marriage if we go back to what that was about. ... I don't have ownership of any of the mothers. We create families in the sense of we created a beautiful entity.\"\n\nRihanna is having kids without marriage:It matters more than you think..\n\nIt's tempting to speculate about a phenomenon that makes little sense to many. But, as Rockwell reminds, the reality of celebrity culture is that we only catch a glimpse of their personal lives. Without knowing the intimate details, we as outsiders will never truly know how worrisome — or how functional — Cannon's family of 10 actually is.\n\n'I'm taking it five minutes at a time':Nick Cannon reflects on grieving his infant son", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/us/nyc-squirrels-splooting-heat-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "The squirrels 'splooting' all over New York City are just fine, officials ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf you see a squirrel splayed on its belly, you might be worried for the critter’s welfare. But don’t worry: It’s just “splooting,” as officials say – and it’s perfectly healthy.\n\nThe term splooting exploded on the internet shortly after the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation posted about the behavior on Twitter.\n\n“If you see a squirrel lying down like this, don’t worry; it’s just fine,” wrote the department on Twitter alongside an image of a squirrel stretching out its limbs. “On hot days, squirrels keep cool by splooting (stretching out) on cool surfaces to reduce body heat. It is sometimes referred to as heat dumping.”\n\nCharlotte Devitz, a biologist and PhD student studying squirrel behavior at the University of Minnesota, told CNN that she first noticed squirrels splooting while she was researching squirrels for her master’s degree.\n\n“At the time I wasn’t really familiar with the term. We just called it ‘flop’ behavior,” she said. “I thought it was super cute. For a long time I tried to find published articles on what this behavior was, but I didn’t have a lot of success.”\n\nDevitz says that splooting seems more common among larger, hairier squirrel species, like grey squirrels and fox squirrels. This dovetails with the scientific explanation for why squirrels sploot: It helps them cope with the heat, according to Devitz.\n\nThe more scientific name for splooting is “heat dumping,” Devitz said. “The squirrel is putting as much of their body surface as possible in contact with a cooler surface, frequently on concrete or pavement that’s been in the shade.”\n\n“We’ve had quite record-breaking heat this summer, so this behavior has been very, very prominent,” she said.\n\nSplooting is a “nice way for them to thermoregulate,” especially because squirrels don’t lose much body heat by sweating, Devitz said. The behavior, she said, is “also seen in other mammals. It’s just gained a lot of visibility because a lot of people see it and become worried when they see squirrels on their belly.”\n\nSplooting may be especially common in cities like New York because of the way urban areas trap heat, Devitz says.\n\n“It’s quite possible there’s a higher incidence of this type of behavior in squirrels that are in urban areas, just because they’re more in need of ways to cool down,” she said.\n\n“With climate change,” Devitz said, “overall temperatures are rising. We’re seeing more of these heat spikes, more drought. I think it’s quite possible that this behavior will be more and more prominent and more and more necessary for the squirrel.”\n\nDevitz notes that the cooling benefits of splooting are balanced by the possible risks squirrels face from predators.

And when Heidi was pregnant with their second child — their daughter, Juno — Taylor posted a video of an intricate Rube Goldberg machine he'd constructed through their entire house that ended with Juno's gender reveal.\n\n“That video kind of blew up and it kind of opened my eyes to go, ‘oh, maybe I can use those skill in my videos as well,’ \" Taylor said. \"I found this cool niche of A) being an invested father and B) being a millennial that knows how to work with your hands.\"\n\nEnter Fort Collins\n\nAfter about four years of success with their Dude Dad videos, Taylor and Heidi decided it was time for a change.\n\nThey'd lived in Los Angeles for a decade, and doing so with kids was getting harder and harder, Taylor said.\n\nThe family decided to move and narrowed their choices down to Minneapolis, Nashville and Fort Collins. In the vlog where they announced these contenders, Taylor made sure to say \"Colorado\" after \"Fort Collins\" — \"because if you don't, no one will know where Fort Collins is.\"\n\nThey ultimately landed on Fort Collins, owing the decision to its proximity to the mountains and their family in South Dakota and North Dakota as well as consistently sunny days and the fact that some of their friends already lived here.\n\n\"We just kind of jumped,\" Taylor said. \"Three weeks later, we were under contract for a house we’d never seen in a city we’d spent very little time in.”\n\nThe couple purchased a 1970s tri-level with lots of DIY project potential last May and had its kitchen and living room gutted down to the studs by the time they moved in a few weeks later.\n\n\"That was my kitchen,\" Heidi said, pointing to a hip-height built-in landing where she had once set up camping gear to cook.\n\nFrom the archive:Fort Collins man leaves behind wife, 2 young kids for a History Channel survival show (and shot at $500K)\n\nIn time, they renovated it into what it is now — a cheery space with vaulted, planked ceilings and a bright and open kitchen dotted with family photos and kids artwork.\n\nThey showed the whole process to their followers through a series of vlogs on their various Dude Dad channels. The vlogs continued to take off in the family's first year in Fort Collins, and Dude Dad now has more than 3 million followers on Facebook as well as 330,000 each on YouTube and Instagram.\n\nThe Dude Dad team also grew, now consisting of Taylor, Heidi and their friends (and video whizzes) DJ Cosgrove and Matt Berkenpas, who film and edit vlogs for the channels.\n\nBetween videos of shiplap and kitchen island installation, the couple also does comedic skits on parenthood and everyday life.\n\nEarlier this week, they posted a video of Taylor impersonating Heidi in her third trimester of pregnancy — wig, baby bump and all. A day later, they posted another video of Heidi reacting to it.\n\n\"I've never wanted to be in the spotlight, so it's pretty odd for me,\" said Heidi, who had never been a part of the entertainment industry back in Los Angeles — she worked with victims of human trafficking instead.\n\nFor subscribers:In the ever-changing world of COVID-19 restrictions, will Fort Collins' festivals happen?\n\n\"No, she hasn't,\" Taylor said. \"But it's funny because I think she's more popular than I am. If you look at my Instagram, my top posts are either pictures of her or pictures of me dressed as her.\"\n\nThe Dude Dad team usually produces about a video a week but is ramping up to likely double that, Taylor said.\n\nAfter all, there's plenty to video. While their house looks immaculate, there is always another project lurking. They need to finish the new baby's nursery, and the family's backyard is notably missing a cool playhouse like the ones Taylor helped build as part of \"Super Dad.\"\n\nTaylor said he plans to remedy that soon for Theo and Juno's sake.\n\nAnd there's a never-ending stream of material when it comes to funny takes on fatherhood and family life.\n\n“That’s what I’ve always wanted the page to be about. It should be a fun, positive place for people to come,\" Taylor said. \"One happy corner on the internet.”\n\nErin Udell reports on news, culture, history and more for the Coloradoan.

Twitter and tabloids claim to know", "text": "It's the bane of being royal and newly-married in the internet age: Twitter and tabloid media will obsess over your midsection and pronounce you pregnant – over and over, until one day, like a broken clock, they finally get it right.\n\nSo, just short of four months since the former Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, the newly minted HRH the Duchess of Sussex is getting the tabloid treatment.\n\n\"In very happy news, a Kensington Palace insider has confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant and has all but cleared her diary to ensure she rests as much as possible,\" declared the Australian gossip weekly New Idea last week.\n\nThus, the magazine said, the royal couple's much-anticipated tour Down Under in October would have to be canceled.\n\nBaloney, said Kensington Palace, without using that precise term.\n\nOn Monday, the palace issued more details of the Down Under tour, which will mark Harry and Meghan's first big international trip in their new royal role as globe-trotting sweethearts of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe couple – both of them – will spend the last two weeks in October touring Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, including an appearance at Harry's Invictus Games in Sydney.\n\nGossip media have always been keenly interested in royal pregnancies because they're responding to their audiences – who are keenly interested in royal pregnancies. Remember that several of the more exuberant magazines, such as the American Life&Style, confidently predicted – twice – that Duchess Kate of Cambridge was about to give birth to twins.\n\n\"Kate Middleton Is Pregnant With Twins and She's Already Picking out Names! (EXCLUSIVE),\" shouted the headline on L&S last year. She didn't. In April, she gave birth to a baby boy, Prince Louis.\n\nBut interest in a possible Sussex pregnancy is even higher, in part due to their status as the royal couple of the moment, and in part due to Meghan's age: She turned 37 in August.\n\nBut the \"evidence\" being cited for her alleged pregnancy is pretty thin, and thinly sourced. To wit: Last week, when she and Harry attended a charity gala in London, she wore an electric blue Jason Wu frock with a ruffle detail at the waist.\n\n\"Is there already a bun in the oven?\" speculated Hollywood Life.\n\nOn Twitter, people in no position to know looked at pictures of Meghan in the dress and claimed to have \"feelings\" that she is pregnant.\n\nBut how could Meghan \"look\" pregnant in Jason Wu when only days before, at a charity gala performance of \"Hamilton\" in London, she wore a tuxedo-style mini-dress by Judith & Charles that showed off her slender waist. No baby bump in sight.\n\nThen a video surfaced of Harry and Meghan meeting some children at a different charity gala showing the prince, 33, rubbing his wife's back – and that, too, was taken as evidence of...well, something. (Actually, the two of them show way more PDA than most royal couples, although usually she is the one who is patting his back.)\n\nKensington Palace, of course, declined to comment one way or another, but US Weekly cited an unnamed “insider\" as pooh-poohing the pregnancy rumors. It was merely \"an unflattering dress and wind,” the magazine reported. Harry and Meghan are focusing the first year of their marriage on their royal duties and charities and will start a family later.\n\nTo be sure, some royal-covering media are uncomfortable with the Sussex baby bump watch. Harper's Bazaar points out that most people would not engage in this kind of rude speculation about anyone they actually know.\n\n\"You get no points for spotting her condition first. It just makes you look like an insensitive jerk,\" the magazine declared Monday.\n\nBut the jerks are moving on to the next unconfirmed rumor of pregnancy: Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher and social worker who lives in Los Angeles but is said to be moving to London any day now.\n\nOn Sunday, the Daily Star, a London tabloid in the same media company as the tabloid Express and Sunday Express, reported that Ragland is taking \"nanny classes\" through a parenting center, Cradle Company, in Pasadena.\n\nShe's taking classes in breastfeeding, childbirth, newborn care, CPR and first aid because she plans to move to Kensington Palace to help Meghan once the first baby arrives, The Star claimed.\n\n“Meghan wants to avoid hiring staff if possible once her first child arrives. The thought of having her mum move in with them and take on the role of baby nurse is the best possible solution to that.\"\n\nAlix Abbamonte, a spokeswoman for Cradle Company, declined to comment to USA TODAY.\n\nNever mind, the rest of the celebrity media crowd seized on this unconfirmed report as an excuse to discuss her alleged pregnancy. On Monday, the Express reported that Ragland quit her job as a social worker in May and \"is expected to move to London as early as this month.\"\n\nCan any of this be officially confirmed? Not by the palace, which generally avoids announcing royal pregnancies until after the first 12 weeks have passed. (A recent exception: Duchess Kate, whose struggles with acute morning sickness caused her to cancel engagements early in her pregnancies, thus forcing the palace to make early announcements.)\n\nNor has Ragland confirmed anything. In fact, unlike Meghan's father, Ragland's ex-husband, Thomas Markle Sr, Meghan's mother has been resolutely discrete: She has not given a media interview since her daughter's relationship with Harry first emerged in 2016.\n\nDon't expect her to change that position now.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/10"}]}

His reward, other than resting an oft-injured ankle this postseason, is a second Lombardi Trophy for the reigning NFL MVP.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57 on Sunday, the team’s second title in four seasons. A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nMahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns. Kansas City scored a touchdown on its first three drives of the second half after trailing at halftime 24-14.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was 27 of 37 for 304 yards passing, but was a force on the ground. He rushed for three touchdowns (15 carries, 70 yards) and tied the game at 35 on a two-point conversion with about five minutes left.\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce (six catches, 81 yards, touchdown) bested his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, on the game’s biggest stage, while Chiefs coach Andy Reid defeated his former team.\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl 57:Patrick Mahomes and Co. capture second title in four seasons\n\nThis is like watching Michael Jordan in his prime. Patrick Mahomes is 27. He's on a team-friendly contract. In the five seasons he has been starter, the Chiefs have made it at least to the AFC title game. As long as Mahomes is under center, this will be the standard. He won his second Super Bowl MVP days after he won his second league MVP.\n\nMahomes had his right ankle injury reaggravated late in the second quarter when Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards fell on it as he dragged him to the turf. Ho hum. All Mahomes did after the injury was complete 13 of 14 passes for 93 yards and a pair of scores. As if that wasn't enough, with 2:55 left to play in a tie game, he outran the Eagles defense on a 26-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal.\n\nRead Lorenzo Reyes' full analysis of Super Bowl 57's winners and losers here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles had a 10-point lead as Rihanna took center stage at halftime.

I was hoping they would let it slide.\"\n\nThat didn't stop fans of the Eagles -- and ones who were neutral for the big game -- from becoming outraged when the holding call allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock Sunday and win the Super Bowl 38-35. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nRead the what referee Carl Cheffers had to say about the play.\n\nSuper Bowl champions for the second time in four seasons, the Kansas City Chiefs seem quite ready to begin game-planning for their next opponent.\n\nHistory.\n\n\"It's a whole other feeling,\" said All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce after winning ring No. 2. \"I wanted this one more than I ever wanted a game in my life.

And Olsen distinguished himself with his assessment of the most critical play of the game.\n\nRead our full analysis of the Super Bowl 57 broadcast here.\n\nThe grass used in State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl 57 took nearly two years and more than $800,000 to prepare for Sunday, but it wasn't without faults. The playing conditions were less than pretty.\n\nPlayers from both the Eagles and Chiefs struggled to get traction on the natural grass and slipped many times. At least half a dozen Eagles players switched cleats during the first half in an attempt to get a better grip, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, who changed from Jordan 11 cleats to Jordan 1 cleats.\n\nEagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, who said he's \"not a grass expert,\" described the conditions as \"pretty slippery,\" similar to \"playing on a water park.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was one of the highest-scoring Super Bowl games ever played. It was a thrilling showdown that featured numerous records either broken (longest punt return) or tied (most points scored by a player, Jalen Hurts with 20).\n\nHere is a look at the highest-scoring Super Bowls.\n\nTravis Kelce was the winner of the unofficial \"Kelce Bowl,\" as his Kansas City Chiefs defeated his brother Jason's Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57.\n\nBut as the Chiefs celebrated their victory and Travis Kelce gave a memorable postgame interview alongside Patrick Mahomes, he made sure to see his brother following the game, as the Kelce brothers shared an embrace and briefly spoke as the confetti fell down on State Farm Stadium.\n\nJason Kelce can be heard congratulating Travis, even cracking a smile and telling him to \"go celebrate.\" Before they part, both Kelce's told each other \"I love you.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Super Bowl, like every other NFL game, has two halves. The Philadelphia Eagles only showed up for one of them.\n\nAfter pushing the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink and hobbling Patrick Mahomes, the Eagles imploded in the second half. They were outscored, outgained, outdisciplined – outhustled – and, as a result, they're out a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, given the final score was 38-35 and it took the Chiefs until the closing seconds to seal the victory. But when you have a 10-point lead, all the momentum and Mahomes barely able to run off the field at halftime, that's as close to a gimme as it gets in the NFL's biggest game.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nThe Blackest, most woke Super Bowl ever — can’t believe I wrote that since this is the Republican NFL, but here we are — started by again featuring the Black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” this time performed by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThen Rihanna performed at halftime. Despite once saying she wouldn’t perform in the Super Bowl halftime show because of the way the NFL treated Colin Kaepernick and protesting players, she was back, and make no mistake, Rihanna is one of the Blackest, proudest performers of our time.\n\nBut wait, it gets Blacker.\n\nSinger Babyface, a generational rhythm and blues singer, sang “America the Beautiful” before the game. He’s produced dozens of R&B hits and won 12 Grammy Awards. At this point we had the Black national anthem, Rihanna performing and two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time ever. During Black History Month. This wasn’t the Super Bowl. This was Wakanda.\n\nRead MIke Freeman's full column here.\n\nThe record for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history now belongs to Kadarius Toney.\n\nToney broke several tackles on the punt return for a 65-yard return, making it the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe Chiefs then scored three plays later on a Patrick Mahomes pass to Skyy Moore.\n\nThere has never been a punt return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, but there have been multiple kickoff return TDs. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHow excited was Andy Reid to win the Super Bowl?\n\nAndy Reid, immediately after winning his second Super Bowl, could not contain his excitement.\n\nWhen Fox sideline reporter Tom Rinaldi asked Reid how happy he was, the Kansas City Chiefs coach responded with his typical jovial sense of humor.\n\n“I could kiss you right now, but I’m not going to,” Reid told Rinaldi, as both laughed after the exchange.\n\nReid led the Chiefs to their second championship in four seasons.\n\nReid credited his offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy during his postgame interview.\n\n“Eric Bienemy was tremendous down the stretch there,” Reid said, complimenting his assistant who has been passed over for head coaching jobs several times.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nJalen Hurts ties record for points in Super Bowl\n\nThe game is not over, but Jalen Hurts has tied a Super Bowl record: most points scored in the game.\n\nIn Super Bowl 51, James White accounted for 20 in the epic 28-3 comeback the New England Patriots pulled off against the Atlanta Falcons, including the game-winning touchdown in overtime.\n\nHurts has three touchdowns on the ground (one through the air) and the two-point conversion that tied the game at 35 was the equalizer with White.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nAnd we're all tied in Super Bowl 57 after Eagles score\n\nThese Eagles will not go quietly.\n\nTrailing by eight points in the fourth quarter, Jalen Hurts converted once again on third down early in the drive with a patented sneak. He found A.J Brown on the next third down for another first. Brown and Hurts connected again for 11 yards and another first.\n\nGiven plenty of time, Hurts found DeVonta Smith streaking down the left sideline on a blown coverage. Smith could not keep his balance and remain in bounds and went out at the 2-yard line, but not before picking up 45 yards. Hurts scored on the next play via a – you guessed it – quarterback sneak.\n\nHurts then tied the game on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt on a designed run to the left, breaking tackles and persevering over the goal line to even it at 35 with 5:15 left in the game.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nKansas City continues second-half domination\n\nKadarius Toney, Super Bowl MVP?\n\nToney had two of the biggest plays for the Chiefs during the fourth quarter, his latest was a 65-yard punt return - the longest in Super Bowl history - went to Philadelphia 5-yard line with 10:11 left in the game.\n\nThree plays later the Chiefs added to their fourth-quarter lead as Patrick Mahomes found receiver Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Chiefs took a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nToney, acquired by the Chiefs during the season, is turning out to be a pivotal move that paid off in Kansas City’s favor during the biggest game of the season. His earlier 5-yard touchdown put the Chiefs ahead in the fourth quarter.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChiefs take first lead in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Chiefs waiting until the fourth quarter to finally go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found receiver Kadarius Toney for a walk-in 5-yard touchdown, and kicker Harrison Butker made the extra point to put Kansas City ahead 28-27 with 12:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nToney went in motion toward the middle of the field, but turned quickly back to the right sidelinefor a wide-open touchdown.\n\nDuring the drive, running back Isiah Pacheco (with runs of 9 and 11 yards) and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster (with four catches for 38 yards) were instrumental for Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nReplay decision helps Eagles add to lead on Chiefs\n\nJalen Hurts could not have thrown a better ball. On third-and-14 from the Kansas City 47, Hurts dropped back on the team’s first drive of the half with a three-point lead. He found tight end Dallas Goedert near the sideline between two defenders past the sticks for what appeared to be yet another third down conversion.\n\nAlthough Goedert bobbled the ball, he regained possession in time to land both feet in bounds and the call was upheld. The challenge cost Andy Reid and the Chiefs their first timeout of the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia moved the ball inside the red zone after the play but had to settle for a field goal to make it 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHurt ankle, no problem for Patrick Mahomes\n\nAfter injuring his ankle on his final play of the second quarter, Mahomes started the second half, and even ran for a 14-yard gain inside the 5-yard line on the first drive of the third quarter.\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs on a touchdown drive to start the second half, which included a low pass to tight end Travis Kelce that kept their drive alive.\n\nChiefs running back Isiah Pacheco scored on a 1-yard run to help the Chiefs trim their deficit. The Eagles are holding onto a 24-21 lead after the first possession in the second half.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nRihanna shines bright in Super Bowl halftime show\n\nRihanna has already evolved into an immensely successful singer, a business mogul with a net worth of more than $1 billion and, as of last year, a mom.\n\nOn Sunday, the multihyphenate added another accomplishment to the checklist: Super Bowl halftime headliner.\n\nTaking the State Farm Stadium stage in Glendale, Arizona, with her most visible outing in years, Rihanna stormed through a vibrant production that spotlighted her flexible R&B grooves coupled with infectious pop hooks. And, of course, her distinctive fashion style.\n\nALL OF THE LIGHTS:Rihanna stuns in spectacular Super Bowl performance\n\n- Melissa Ruggieri\n\nSuper Bowl halftime stats: Patrick Mahomes held to 89 yards passing\n\nOnly once has a team lost the Super Bowl after leading by double-digits at halftime: the Atlanta Falcons before the New England Patriots staged their famous comeback from a 28-3 deficit six years ago.\n\nThe Eagles, who lead 24-14 at the break, finished the first half with a time of possession of 21:54, leaving the Chiefs with 8:06. They ran 44 plays compared to the Chiefs’ 20 and outgained them 270-128.\n\nHere are some other statistics from the first half:\n\nNotable Eagles stats\n\nThird-down efficiency: 6-for-10,\n\nJalen Hurts: 17-for-22, 183 yards, TD; 11 rushes, 63 yards, 2 TD\n\nDeVonta Smith: six catches, 55 yards\n\nA.J Brown: three catches, 74 yards, TD\n\nNotable Chiefs stats\n\nThird-down efficiency:0-for-3\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8-for-13, 89 yards, TD\n\nIsiah Pacheco: five carries, 28 yards\n\nTravis Kelce: three catches, 60 yards, TD\n\nBolton: three tackles, fumble recovery, TD\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles take 24-14 lead at halftime after late field goal\n\nIn the NFC championship game, DeVonta Smith quickly got his team to the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball after a questionable catch on the Eagles’ first drive of their victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt did not work against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nA replay review late in the second quarter showed Smith did not maintain control of the ball after a catch to the Kansas City 13, and it was ruled incomplete. The Eagles tried to snap the ball right away, but since there were less than two minutes in the first half, the officials in the booth called down to the field for a review.\n\nAfter the over turn, A.J. Brown, had a 22-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia in field goal range. Jake Elliott connected from 35 yards out as time expired in the first half, with the Eagles taking a 24-14 advantage into the locker room.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes limps off after appearing to re-injure ankle\n\nWell, Patrick Mahomes’ injured right ankle was looking good until it wasn’t.\n\nMahomes, who was suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional playoff game, scrambled on third down shortly before halftime, and his injured right foot took the brunt of the fall after he was tackled by Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards with 1:44 left in the second quarter.\n\nMahomes limped off the field in obvious pain and was later shown in difficulty while his ankle was being evaluated by trainers on the sidelines.\n\nEarlier in the game, Mahomes appeared to run with ease like his foot was healed after a high-ankle sprain suffered last month.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles back in front on another Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThe Eagles entered the Super Bowl with 35 fourth-down attempts. The 36th and 37th were the most important of the season thus far.\n\nOn fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44, Hurts ran to daylight and converted the first fourth down of the drive with a 28-yard carry down the right sideline. Facing a fourth-and 2, the Eagles got Kansas City to jump inside the red zone to set up a first-and-goal and Hurts scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on the next play to make it 21-14 with just over two minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe drive was 12 plays and took 7:19 off the clock. The Eagles are dominating time of possession. They have had the ball for 20:32, while Mahomes and Kansas City have had it for 7:08.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs erase deficit with defensive touchdown after Eagles miscue\n\nThe Eagles had a seven-point lead and were in Chiefs territory once again.\n\nInstead of putting Kansas City back on its heels, they let them back in the game.\n\nFacing a thrd-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 47, right guard Isaac Seumalo jumped early and moved the Eagles back five yards. On the next play, Hurts began to run on a quarterback keeper, but he dropped the ball and Nick Bolton – the Chiefs’ leading tackler – scooped it up and scored on a 36-yard return that tied the game.\n\nIt was the first fumble Hurts lost since Week 10 against Indianapolis and the team's first turnover of the playoffs.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nA.J. Brown puts Eagles ahead with long touchdown catch\n\nThe ability to hit the big play has been a hallmark for the Eagles offense all season.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, Brown made it.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts had all day in the pocket to watch Brown streak down the field and into double-coverage. Hurts threw to a place anybody who could catch the ball would have to make an adjustment.\n\nJuan Thornhill and McDuffie in coverage weren’t able. Brown did, and the Eagles regain the lead 14-7d on the 45-yard completion.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs fail to take lead as Harrison Butker field goal goes 'doink'\n\nThe Chiefs moved the ball well, but settled for a field-goal attempt when facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of their second drive. Butker’s 42-yard kick drifted left and was no good after hitting the upright, keeping the score tied at 7.\n\nThe possession by the Chiefs drive featured a stellar 22-yard pass from Mahomes to Kelce, and even some trickery from Kansas City. Kelce and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster signaled to the Chiefs sidelines like they did not know a play call, then turned around after Mahomes found running back Jerick McKinnon for a 7-yard completion on the right side.\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception on the next play, and the Chiefs’ field-goal kick miss could come back to haunt them later this game.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles RB Miles Sanders sidelined after hit on game's first play\n\nOn the first play of the game, Sanders carried for a one-yard loss. Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie tracked him down near the sideline and delivered a large hit, knocking the ball out of bounds.\n\nSanders, a fourth-year player from Penn State, was seen shaking his hand after the play and went into the locker room before returning to the field. Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell handled the ball-carrying duting in his absence. Sanders returned to the field in the second quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs respond quickly to tie game against Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs did not waste any time responding to the Eagles’ first score.\n\nChiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes found who else than his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, for a 18-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 with 6:57 left in the first quarter.\n\nMahomes’ first pass of the game was a 20-yard completion to Kelce. More important: Mahomes’ ankle looks great, too, after he galloped for an 8-yard run during the drive.\n\nThe Chiefs got near the red zone with a 24-yard run to the left side by running back Isaiah Pacheco.\n\nKelce also celebrated his touchdown with a dance in the end zone.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles jump out to early Super Bowl lead on Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThe Eagles received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown on the game’s first possession. Jalen Hurts found receiver DeVonta Smith on a key third down and later hit him for 23 yards to move Philadelphia into the red zone on a run-pass option that was initially snuffed out.\n\nKenneth Gainwell initially had the score, but replay review quickly confirmed his elbow was down short of the goal line. The call was Hurts’ specialty: a quarterback sneak. Behind the Eagles’ elite offensive line, Hurts plowed ahead for six points. Extra point was good and it's Philadelphia 7-0 early.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl coin toss, Eagles get ball first\n\nIf you bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl coin toss, congratulations.\n\nThe Chiefs called tails. And the Chiefs won the toss. They chose to defer and will kickoff to the Eagles start the game, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nTails breaks a two-game streak by heads, and has been the coin toss winner in seven of the last 10 Super Bowls, according to Oddsshark.com.\n\nAt +100, one would have doubled their money picking the Chiefs to win the coin toss.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph shine with Super Bowl national anthems\n\nWith nearly as much attention paid to the music as the game during the Super Bowl, the trifecta of artists who took the field Sunday prior to kickoff knew the importance of their platform.\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Babyface were tapped for the honors. Ralph singer infused the Black national anthem - \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" - with the type of gusto exhibited during her Emmy acceptance speech last fall.\n\nBabyface followed with \"America the Beautiful\" and the festivities were capped by Stapleton's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that showcased his vocal skills.\n\nRIGHT NOTE:Reviewing the pregame Super Bowl singing performances\n\n- Mellissa Ruggieri\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni, center Jason Kelce both cry during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nAs Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem before the kick of the Super Bowl, cameras found Sirianni and Kelce, both of whom had tears in their eyes.\n\nKelce spoke about tears on the big stage after the Eagles’ Super Bowl 52 victory, saying he would find himself crying in the shower in the lead-up to that game against the New England Patriots.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nDamar Hamlin introduced on field at Super Bowl 57, speaks to Fox's Michael Strahan\n\nThe NFL continues to celebrate the remarkable recovery by Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin from cardiac arrest he suffered in a Jan. 2 game.\n\nHamlin received a warm ovation from the crowd at State Farm Stadium.\n\nEarlier, on Fox's pregame show, Hamlin spoke with Michael Strahan about what he remembered when he made that fateful tackle on Bengals WR Tee Higgins.\n\nHamlin paused for nearly nine seconds.\n\n\"That's something I don't really want to get too deep into, in the detail,\" Hamlin said. \"That's something I'm still trying to work through. Why did it happen to me?\"\n\nThe full interview will air Monday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nEagles fans boo Cowboys QB Dak Prescott pregame\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received a rousing ovation after being recognized as the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his philanthropy and community impact.\n\nBut not the ovation you’d think one would receive for winning one of the NFL’s highest honors.\n\nEagles fans at the Super Bowl booed Prescott, because division rivalries don’t cease even for special awards.\n\nPrescott was a good sport about the reaction he received.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nWith injured ankle, Patrick Mahomes goes for Super Bowl win No. 2\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl start for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes split his previous two appearances, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54 before losing the championship game the following season against Tom Brady and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes’ recovery from a right high-ankle sprain in the divisional playoff and his dart to the sidelines that set up a game-winning field goal to help the Chiefs beat the Bengals in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29 only added to his growing legacy.\n\nMahomes also has a chance to further separate himself from the rest of the current pack of active quarterbacks. With Brady’s retirement, Mahomes could have more rings than any other with his second championship.\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nThree keys to victory in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe pregame hype is finally dying down and the focus of Super Bowl 57 is ready to be turned to the gridiron where it belongs.\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles have been the class of their respective leagues this season, so the most important thing for either team may only be the ability to execute what they already do well.\n\nHere are three keys to winning, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon:\n\nEagles pass rush vs. Chiefs offensive line\n\nChiefs aerial attack vs. Eagles pass defense\n\nEagles rushing offense vs. Chiefs defense\n\nSuper Bowl X-factors: Unknown to hero?\n\nThe Super Bowl is where a relative nobody can become a household name, a place where Malcolm Butler and David Tyree were transformed from obscurity to an association with football's biggest stage, forever.\n\nThe stars will attract the attention and have the most impact on Super Bowl 57. The X-factors, however – the ones the majority of the 100-plus-million viewers do not know – will also play pivotal roles in determining who lifts the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere are a few who could find themselves in the spotlight on Sunday, according to USA TODAY Sports' Chris Bumbaca:\n\nEagles DT Jason Hargrave\n\nEagles RB Kenneth Gainwell\n\nChiefs OT Andrew Wylie\n\nChiefs LB Nick Bolton\n\nHow do Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts stack up?\n\nThis margin isn't as wide as you might think. Jalen Hurts, 24, is a star who is going to be a problem in the NFC for a long time. He worked with Tom House this offseason and has refined his mechanics. His ability to compromise defenses with his rushing ability has made it increasingly difficult to defend Philadelphia. And, if the Chiefs use a spy to try to limit what Hurts can do out in open space, it takes away a potential defender Kansas City can use in the secondary.\n\nAll that said, Patrick Mahomes is the most gifted passer in the NFL, possibly of all time. His arm makes it so that the Chiefs can score on any given play. And while he may not rack up rushing yards, his mobility — though it may be tested Sunday by a high ankle sprain — allows him to extend plays and find receivers who can break off their routes.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhere Kansas City has a potential home run hitter in Isiah Pacheco, the Eagles carry significant depth in the backfield. Philadelphia’s top three running backs — Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell — are all capable of taking over a game. Just look at Gainwell’s production; he averaged just 3.1 rushes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs, that number has jumped to 13 per and he has responded by leading the Eagles in rushing in both the divisional and conference championship rounds. Sanders, meanwhile, has a nose for the end zone.\n\nPacheco is explosive both rushing the ball and catching it out of the backfield, but Kansas City often doesn’t give him enough touches to be a major factor. The team also activated Clyde Edwards-Helaire (ankle) off of injured reserve and he’d provide a huge boost if he’s able to play.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is perhaps the one position where a team has the strongest advantage over the other. A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are both star playmakers whose different skill sets complement each other; Brown is physical and quick and can beat defenders with power and Smith is a silky route runner who is elusive in space.\n\nOn the other side, the Chiefs have navigated their first season without Tyreek Hill quite well, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney making plays. Still, no Kansas City wideout eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in the regular season. Making matters worse for the Chiefs is that they are facing several nagging injuries at the position, with Mecole Hardman placed on injured reserve. Better put this way, Mahomes and the Chiefs system elevate Smith-Schuster, Valdes-Scantling and Toney, while Brown and Smith are stars who would flourish anywhere.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDallas Goedert has been a solid and steady option for Hurts. But in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, he reached the 100-yard mark only once.\n\nTravis Kelce isn’t just in the conversation for the best tight end in football — he’s already there — he’s in the conversation for the best of all time. Kelce has secured four All-Pro nominations in the last seven seasons, he’s rewriting the record book and he has become Mahomes’ preferred target and a near-unguardable player in the middle of the field.\n\nGoedert does have a clear advantage over Kelce in run blocking; because Philadelphia sets its identity on the ground, Goedert has become a key piece in the scheme. Still, Kelce is generational.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWho are the commentators on FOX NFL Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show?\n\nAs is the case during the regular season, Fox Sports has Curt Menefee hosting its NFL Sunday pregame show, which is being broadcast live at State Farm Stadium.\n\nProviding analysis and commentary are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson. Joining the set for the playoffs is retired NFL tight end-turned-kicker Rob Gronkowski.\n\nReporting from around the stadium: Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi, Charissa Thompson and Jay Glazer.\n\nStars from every industry are descending on State Farm Stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn the stadium early was NBA star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.\n\nEagles superfan Bradley Cooper was also in attendance ready to cheer his team to victory.\n\nRap mogul Jay Z was spotted on the sidelines taking pictures of his daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Travis Kelce, Fletcher Cox make fashion statements as kickoff approaches\n\nEveryone knows what the players will be wearing when Super Bowl 57 kicks off. The Chiefs will be wearing white uniforms with red pants, red numerals and yellow trim. The Eagles will be wearing green uniforms with either green or white pants.\n\nHowever, pregame fashions can be any style and color under the rainbow, as evidenced by Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chiefs TE Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd then there's Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.\n\nThis is another fascinating battle, as these are two of the top units in the NFL. The Eagles, however, have the best O-line in football. Their communication and ability to work together are unrivaled. They have two of the best players at their positions, center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson (both of whom were first-team All-Pro selections). They bore open holes in Nick Sirianni’s zone read offense and are disciplined and clean in avoiding penalties.\n\nBut where Philadelphia has two All-Pros on its offensive line, the Chiefs have a pair of second-teamers in center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney. Orlando Brown has been excellent after moving to left tackle and, considering this is a unit that has been remade, it has done a remarkable job of keeping Mahomes clean.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Eagles are five sacks in the Super Bowl from breaking the record of the 1984 Bears for total sacks in the regular and postseason combined (82). Three of Philadelphia’s starting four defensive linemen, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham notched double-digit sack totals in the regular season, as each posted 11. The other starter, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, is one of the game’s best interior linemen and recorded seven. The unit has depth with end Robert Quinn and tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh coming on in relief.\n\nTo be clear, the Chiefs aren’t bad, they’re just not this good. Chris Jones is a force and the best interior lineman in football and Frank Clark can disrupt the timing and rhythm of opposing offenses. Kansas City just doesn’t have the depth or wealth of star talent to match Philadelphia in this spot.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s almost unfair to consider Haason Reddick as a pure linebacker, since Philadelphia loves using him in five-man fronts, rushing off the left side of the line of scrimmage — or even at defensive tackle — so his presence is frankly more of a consideration for the defensive line. With that in mind, where this Eagles defense is weakest is at the other two linebacker spots. And, considering that linebackers and safeties are among the players asked to cover tight ends, this could be a spot where the Chiefs exploit Philadelphia, using Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs unit that included Nick Bolton and Willie Gay Jr. took some time to get settled this season, but it improved after Gay returned from suspension and as the group got healthier. They have speed and excellent range, though they are sometimes caught out of position, in part because of the relative inexperience of Bolton and Gay.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is another spot in which Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive moves in recent seasons have paid off. The three best players on the unit — corners James Bradberry and Darius Slay and strong safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson — were all acquired via trade or free agency. Bradberry had bounced around the league but found a home in Philadelphia’s defense, earning a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nFor the Chiefs, cornerback L’Jarius Sneed clearing concussion protocol is a welcome sight; he doesn’t shy away from contact and actually helps out quite a bit in stopping the run along the outside. Trent McDuffie is a player who has perhaps been overlooked, though he has had a huge impact as a press corner. Rounding out the starters, at safety, Justin Reid and Juan Thornhill have become capable players. The biggest issue with the Kansas City secondary is the occasional blown coverage that can lead to chunk plays.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAs far as kicking and punting goes, this becomes tricky because where the Eagles are strong with place kicker Jake Elliott, the Chiefs are stronger with punter Tommy Townsend, a first-team all-pro. Kansas City place kicker Harrison Butker had the worst season of his career, missing six field goals for a 75% conversion rate. Still, in his last three games, Butker has converted all field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Eagles may be without punter Arryn Siposs (ankle), who has said he is ready to play. He presents an upgrade, though backup Brett Kern has been solid in relief. Where the Chiefs separate themselves is with their return men. Both Isiah Pacheco and Skyy Moore are flashes of lightning who can slip through creases and flip field position.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Chiefs have the wealth of experience and Andy Reid may be the best coach not named Belichick over the last three decades. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should be a head coach. And defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has kept Kansas City’s defense competitive and loves to disguise blitzes, making it difficult for young quarterbacks to read the field.\n\nThe narrative that the Eagles have had a favorable path to the Super Bowl, while accurate, shouldn’t discount the effort and work it takes to win week in and week out. Coach Nick Sirianni’s players swear by him and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen could end up as a head coach this cycle. The zone read offense the pair have assembled requires defenses to make decisions in split seconds. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker brings decades of experience and coordinator Jonathan Gannon oversees a unit that has taken a huge stride since last season.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs unlikely to face 49ers catastrophe if Mahomes gets hurt\n\nThe NFC championship game was a cautionary tale to NFL teams, particularly those vying for a title, about the risks of having only two quarterbacks active on game day.\n\nHowever, if catastrophe befalls the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl 57, they have a plethora of emergency quarterback options – so many, that it's not immediately clear who would take snaps if presumptive MVP Patrick Mahomes and his, backup, Chad Henne, were unable to go. Obviously, that would be a worst-case scenario. But at least the AFC champs might become so wildly unpredictable that it could keep them in a game – at least temporarily.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEx-Broncos coach helps Eagles prepare for Chiefs offense\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reportedly brought in some veteran experience ahead of their Super Bowl 57 appearance against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAccording to reports, the Eagles hired Vic Fangio to assist with game preparations that include self-scouting and analysis. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported Fangio signed a two-week contract that is expected to expire after the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio agreed to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator last month.\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nFathers of Super Bowl 57 QBs wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nDuring Super Bowl 57 you will see more than a game. You'll see two Black quarterbacks — raised lovingly by two Black dads (and also by their moms). You will also see one more thing: a stereotype busted.\n\nIf you're looking for the story — the often repeated one, the ever-lasting one, the stereotypical one — of the Black kid who grew up impoverished and still made it. If you're looking for the same ol' story about the Black kid without a father who overcame this and that and the other thing and golly gee, goodness gracious look at him now. Well, this Super Bowl quarterbacks story is not for you.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nSpecial game-day deliveries for 2 Chiefs players\n\nJust playing in the big game is already memorable enough, but two members of the Kansas City Chiefs will have even more reason to remember this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nWhile he was busy preparing to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti learned his wife Christina went into labor and delivered healthy twin girls early Sunday morning in Chicago.\n\nAt about the same time the Allegretti girls were arriving, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman was frantically tweeting that his girlfriend Chariah Gordon was also about ready to give birth.\n\nThere could also be another Super Bowl baby before long on the other sideline.\n\nEagles center Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are also expecting a baby.\n\nAndy Reid could win second Super Bowl – against his former team\n\nReid, 64, is a no-nonsense coach who has become endearing, never too shy to be himself or make others laugh at his own expense. He proudly wears Hawaiian shirts and professes his love for a good cheeseburger. He’s also one of the most accomplished coaches.\n\nReid was the Eagles’ coach for 14 seasons (1999-2012) and did mostly everything for the franchise – six NFC East titles, five NFC title games, one Super Bowl appearance – except win it all.\n\nWhen he was fired by Philadelphia, Kansas City pounced at the opportunity to hire him, and it has been rewarded with 10 winning seasons, nine playoff berths and a Super Bowl during the 2019 season.\n\nReid has the respect and the résumé to match, and he has an opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame career with a second Super Bowl title. To do it against his former team would be special, too.\n\nSUPER BOWL STORYLINES: Reid, Kelce brothers, Mahomes' ankle all worth watching\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nWho will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nWhile the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles take a break from shining bright like a diamond, Rihanna will be the Super Bowl 57 halftime show performer.\n\nIt's a show that's so exciting, at least one player is hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy award-winner will perform a slew of hits with (or maybe without) some surprise guests. This will be her first public performance since 2018 when she performed DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" at the Grammys.\n\n– Victoria Hernandez\n\nWith 10 Super Bowl appearances, Tom Brady has made his mark on the game's history, setting a plethora of individual records.\n\nBrady, who made 10 Super Bowl appearances with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice – who appeared in four Super Bowls during his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders – hold multiple standards in the NFL's annual championship showcase.\n\nFrom a team perspective, Brady's New England Patriots and Rice's San Francisco 49ers figure prominently.\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any legendary marks be surpassed in Super Bowl 57?\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY: All-time results, winners, MVPs, more\n\nSUPER BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: Nate Davis' 57 greatest moments in Super Bowl lore\n\nHow 'No crush, no rush' slogan has Philadelphia Eagles defense on historic sack pace\n\nThe four-word phrase coined by defensive ends and outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn means the defense has to stop the run to earn the right to rush the quarterback. Entering Super Bowl 57, the defense has lived up to its motto.\n\n“If you don’t stop the run, you can’t pass rush nobody,” Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham said. “You got to take care of business. Early on, you got to send a message and let them know what the game is gonna be. You got to be the dictators. That’s any defense that wants to win a game, you got to let them know what it’s gonna be for the day.”\n\nThe Eagles had the NFL’s second ranked defense in the regular season and the unit hasn’t given up more than seven points in each of its postseason wins leading up to Super Bowl 57. When it comes to rushing the quarterback, the Eagles are on an historic pace.\n\nThe Eagles defense has amassed 78 total sacks across the regular season and postseason, the third most in NFL history. Philadelphia is three sacks away from surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears for the second most sacks ever and five sacks shy of eclipsing the 1984 Bears (82 sacks) for the NFL single-season record.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJoe Biden's pregame Super Bowl interview with Fox called off\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t be giving a pregame Super Bowl interview to Fox Soul after all.\n\nPresidents in recent years have granted wide-ranging interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl. But last week there was confusion over whether Biden would follow the tradition.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted Friday that Biden had been looking forward to an interview on Fox Soul, a streaming sister service to the conservative Fox News. But she said the White House had been informed that the network’s parent company, Fox Corp., canceled the interview.\n\nBiden did pregame interviews with CBS in 2021 and with NBC in 2022.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Superhero?' What other Chiefs say about QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nPatrick Mahomes exploded into an NFL superstar almost from the moment when he became the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018, the year he also won his first MVP trophy.\n\nBut what we all see is not necessarily what Mahomes' teammates see.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports closely monitored and asked Chiefs players and coaches during the days leading up to the big game about what it's like being around their intrepid leader, and some common themes quickly emerged.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEagles' success starts at the top\n\nTo compare the team-building philosophies of the Philadelphia Eagles and last year's Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, and classify them as similar would be to miss the point.\n\nThere is a difference between mortgaging the future and having a foundation for continued success in place. The Rams, quite literally, employed a “(expletive) them picks” strategy. The Eagles have a pair of first-round picks in the 2023 draft and Jalen Hurts, an MVP-level quarterback on a rookie (second-round selection) contract.\n\nLeadership starts at the top. Knowing the right time to push the chips toward the middle is essential to winning it all, and Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has given general manager Howie Roseman, who has been with the organization since 2000, the latitude – and payroll – to be aggressive.\n\nIn Super Bowl 57 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roseman's fingerprints will be all over the field.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\n'Special' Super Bowl for Black quarterbacks\n\nWhen Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts take the field Feb. 12, they will be the first two Black quarterbacks to start against each other in the Super Bowl. It’s an accomplishment both quarterbacks fully embrace.\n\n“It is history. It’s come a long way. I think there has only been (eight) African American quarterbacks to play in a Super Bowl. To be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it’ll be a good one,” Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, told reporters Thursday. “It’s history.”\n\nThere will be eight Black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl once the championship game kicks off: Doug Williams, Steve McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Mahomes and Hurts.\n\n– Tyler Dragon\n\nTHE 100-YEAR LONG ROAD: Fritz Pollard paved the way for Hurts, Mahomes\n\nOPINION: Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nReport: Colts target Eagles offensive coordinator as next head coach\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have reached a decision on who they want as their next head coach – but the process will have to wait until Super Bowl 57 concludes.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the Colts' top choice, and, according to ESPN, the team has already begun informing the other candidates that they are no longer being considered.\n\nSteichen, 37, has run the Eagles offense for the past two seasons. On the way to reaching the Super Bowl, Philadelphia ranked first in rushing yards and third in points per game in 2022. That would seem to mesh well with the Colts, whose offense revolves around 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor.\n\nIn addition, the Arizona Cardinals plan to interview Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon for their head coaching vacancy, according to NFL.com.\n\nEx-Eagles, Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil can't pick a favorite\n\nDick Vermeil led the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance. He also finished his Hall of Fame career coaching the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSo, in what direction is Vermeil’s allegiance flowing for Super Bowl 57?\n\n“I’ve put in my frame of mind right now, philosophically, I’m going to root for both teams to win,” Vermeil told USA TODAY Sports. “And I’ll feel very bad for the team that loses.”\n\nThe only person other than Andy Reid to have coached both the Eagles and the Chiefs, Vermeil, 86, won’t even be inside State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\n– Jarrett Bell\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any of these marks be broken in Super Bowl 57?\n\nJason or Travis?

Playing in its third Super Bowl in four seasons, K.C. collected its second championship in that span. Stocked with young talent and the league's best player, a team that's appeared in five consecutive AFC championship games appears to have extensive staying power.\n\nMahomes, who was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time just days after collecting his second league MVP award, was magnificent, despite aggravating his high ankle sprain late in the first half. But he never missed a snap while leading three consecutive second-half touchdown drives after his team trailed 24-14 at intermission. He completed 21 of 27 passes for 182 yards and three scores and also ran for 44 yards, much of that on his bad wheel.\n\nSUPER BOWL FINAL SCORE:Here's how the Chiefs beat the Eagles\n\nDIDN'T FINISH THE JOB:Eagles collapse in second half, costing themselves Super Bowl 57\n\nNow Mahomes, 27, who surpassed Tom Brady as the youngest QB to start three Super Bowls, might just be able to begin setting his sights on some of the GOAT's other records. But he was hardly the only story in one of Super Sunday's more remarkable matchups.\n\nBet on Black\n\nThe first Super Bowl to feature two Black starting quarterbacks delivered plenty of excitement from the position. Mahomes' heroics aside, Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts nearly crafted an MVP performance of his own.\n\nHurts was at his multi-dimensional best, rushing for 70 yards and three touchdowns (both Super Bowl records for a quarterback) while passing for another 304 yards and one TD. After a December shoulder injury slowed him down and probably cost him any legitimate shot at league MVP honors, Hurts recaptured the form that made him one of the NFL's most dangerous players for most of the season – and looked especially sharp throwing the ball after struggling on that front in previous playoff games.\n\nThe Eagles' third-year star finished with 18 rushing touchdowns, a single-season record for a quarterback when including postseason stats. He became the first player to rush for a pair of first-half TDs in a Super Bowl, and his trifecta matched Hall of Famer Terrell Davis' Super Bowl record. However, his second-quarter fumble proved a crucial mistake.\n\nThree phases\n\nWhile Mahomes was the star of the night, the Chiefs got hefty contributions from their defense and special teams. Among the biggest plays was linebacker Nick Bolton's 36-yard touchdown off Hurts' second-quarter fumble.\n\nToney, Toney\n\nWideout Kadarius Toney, a midseason trade acquisition from the New York Giants, was a huge asset for Kansas City. His fourth-quarter TD catch put the Chiefs up 28-27, and his Super Bowl record 65-yard punt return set up a TD on the subsequent drive.\n\nRookie returns\n\nAfter revamping their offense following the offseason trade of Pro Bowl wideout Tyreek Hill, the Chiefs reaped major output from their youngsters. Running back Isiah Pacheco and receiver Skyy Moore both scored touchdowns, Kansas City joining the vaunted 1985 Bears as the only teams in Super Bowl history to get TDs from multiple rookies.\n\nPressure?\n\nThe Eagles and Chiefs, who ranked first and second, respectively in sacks generated in the 2022 season (a combined 125), combined for a mere two Sunday, both suffered by Hurts.\n\nGame winner\n\nKansas City benefited from good fortune and made some of its own ahead of Harrison Butker's game-winning field goal with 8 seconds left. A holding call on Eagles corner James Bradberry allowed the Chiefs to bleed the clock – an effort advanced by running back Jerick McKinnon going down at the 2-yard line rather than scoring a touchdown that would have given Philadelphia more time to respond.\n\nThird Lombardi for Chiefs\n\nKansas City became the 10th franchise to win the Super Bowl at least three times. The Chiefs have prevailed twice under CEO and co-owner Clark Hunt, whose father, Lamar, founded the AFL in 1960 and was the team's original owner when the franchise was born as the Dallas Texans. The Chiefs' first Super Bowl win came under Lamar Hunt following the 1969 season, but it took 50 years before their second.\n\nKelce Bowl\n\nThe first Super Bowl that featured brothers opposing each other, Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce ran his record to 3-0 against older brother Jason (the Eagles All-Pro center). Travis Kelce had a huge night with six catches for 81 yards and a first-quarter TD. His 16 career playoff TD receptions trail only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.\n\nReid Bowl\n\nAndy Reid, the winningest coach in Eagles history, improved to 4-0 against his former team. Reid, also the second-winningest coach in postseason history after Bill Belichick, improved to 2-2 Super Bowls, both victories with K.C.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2023/02/12/super-bowl-2023-score-updates-kansas-city-chiefs-philadelphia-eagles/69893800007/", "title": "Kansas City Chiefs win Super Bowl 57 thriller over Philadelphia ...", "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles faced off on Sunday in Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Look back at our score updates and analysis on the game below.\n\nField called into question:Super Bowl 57 field scrutinized after Chiefs vs. Eagles game\n\nLooking closer at the critical holding penalty on Kansas City's final drive\n\nThere were not a lot of controversial plays in this Super Bowl, but one that was discussed in real time and after the game was the penalty on the Eagles' James Bradberry, who was flagged for holding Kansas City receiver Juju Smith-Schuster with 1:54 left and the Chiefs' facing 3rd and 8 at the Philadelphia 15 in a tie game.\n\nAt first glance there did not look to be much for the officials to call on the play, but in a post-game interview with pool reporter Lindsay Jones, referee Carl Cheffers said: “The receiver went to the inside and he was attempting to release to the outside. The defender grabbed the jersey with his right hand and restricted him from releasing to the outside. So, therefore, we called defensive holding.”\n\nYou know who backed up that opinion? Bradberry himself, taking accountability for a pivotal moment on what turned out to be the Chiefs' winning drive.\n\n“It was a holding. I tugged on the jersey,\" he said after the game.\n\nThe penalty gave Kansas City a first down on the Eagles' 11. After Jerick McKinnon ran for nine yards and intentionally slid short of the end zone, the Chiefs adeptly milked off the remaining time on two Patrick Mahomes kneel-downs, setting up the 27-yard game-winning field goal by Harrison Butker.\n\nWas Super Bowl 57 'rigged' for Chiefs?James Bradberry penalty has Eagles fans crying foul\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl 57 thriller over Eagles in Arizona\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are your Super Bowl 57 champions.\n\nThe team rallied from a 24-14 halftime deficit by scoring on every second half possession in a thrilling 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Sunday.\n\nIt is the team's second Super Bowl championship in four years.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes went 21-for-27 for 182 yards passing to accompany three touchdowns as he overcame a sprained ankle. He also carried six times for 44 yards.\n\nMahomes was named the Super Bowl MVP for his performance.\n\nRunning back Isiah Pacheco rushed 15 times for 76 yards and a touchdown, while tight end Travis Kelce had six catches for 81 yards and a touchdown.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts went 27-for-38 as he made his first appearance in the Super Bowl. He passed for 304 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 70 yards and three touchdowns on 15 carries.\n\nWide receiver DeVonta Smith had seven catches for 100 yards for Philadelphia.\n\nThe game gave Chiefs head coach Andy Reid his second Super Bowl trophy. He is now one of 14 coaches to win more than one Super Bowl.\n\nReid's first Super Bowl win came in 2019, when the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, 31-20.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 38, Eagles 35\n\nChiefs take late lead on field goal vs. Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs have taken a 38-35 lead on the Eagles with a 27-yard field goal by Harrison Butker with eight seconds left in the game.\n\nThe kick capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive that took 5:07 off the clock.\n\nOn a 3rd-and-8 from the Philadelphia 15-yard line, James Bradberry was called for defensive holding after an incomplete pass from Patrick Mahomes, giving the Chiefs a new set of downs.\n\nScore: Chiefs 38, Eagles 35 (:08 left in fourth quarter)\n\nSuper Bowl 58 odds:Kansas City Chiefs favored to repeat in 2024 NFL Championship Game\n\nEagles tie game against Chiefs in fourth quarter\n\nWe have ourselves a Super Bowl thriller.\n\nThe Eagles got right back in this game with an 8-play, 75-yard drive that culminated in a Jalen Hurts 2-yard run for a touchdown and then a successful run on a 2-point conversion by Hurts to tie the game, 35-35.\n\nThere is 5:15 left in the game at State Farm Stadium in Glendale and fans are getting a treat.\n\nScore: Chiefs 35, Eagles 35 (5:15 left in fourth quarter)\n\nChiefs extend lead vs. Eagles\n\nWe've got a completely different ball game.\n\nAfter trailing 24-14 at the half, the Kansas City Chiefs have outscored the Philadelphia Eagles 21-3 in the second half to take a 35-27 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter taking a 28-27 lead, the Chiefs forced a 3-and-out, the Eagles' first of the game.\n\nA 65-yard punt return by Kadarius Toney then set up a 4-yard pass from Patrick Mahomes to Skyy Moore to give the Chiefs a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nWhatever Andy Reid told his team at halftime and the adjustments the team made have paid off.\n\nScore: Chiefs 35, Eagles 27 (9:22 left in game)\n\nChiefs take first lead of Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs lead Super Bowl 57 for the first time.\n\nKansas City went on a 9-play, 75-yard drive and took the lead on a 5-yard pass from Patrick Mahomes to Kadarius Toney.\n\nThe Chiefs have two touchdowns on two second-half possessions after trailing 24-14 at the half.\n\nMahomes is now 17-for 22 passing for 161 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nScore: Chiefs 28, Eagles 27 (12:04 left in game)\n\nEagles add to lead with field goal\n\nThe Eagles just went on a 17-play, 60-yard drive that ended in a 33-yard field goal to give Philadelphia a 27-21 lead.\n\nThe drive took 7:45.\n\nJalen Hurts is now 22-for-31 passing for the Eagles, with 234 yards and a touchdown.

The lone turnover in the game was a fumble by Hurts that the Chiefs ran in for a touchdown, at least keeping Kansas City in the game entering the second half.\n\nThe Chiefs get the ball to start the second half and could really use a scoring drive, but Kansas City especially needs its defense to start getting stops to give the team a chance.\n\nEagles take 10-point lead into halftime\n\nThe Eagles added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by Jake Elliott as time expired in the first half.\n\nPhiladelphia covered 40 yards in 1:22 and eight plays to add to their lead.\n\nThe Chiefs are really fortunate to only be down 10. The Eagles dominated the first half, outgaining Kansas City 270-128.\n\nThey had the ball for 21:54 compared to just 8:06 for the Chiefs.\n\nKansas City does get the ball to start the second half, but Patrick Mahomes status looms large.\n\nScore: Eagles 24, Chiefs 14 (halftime)\n\nWas it a catch by Devonta Smith?\n\nDevonta Smith had a 35-yard catch on the Eagles' next drive that was ruled incomplete upon video review, reversing the call on the field.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEagles force Chiefs to punt\n\nThe Eagles forced the Chiefs to punt late in the first half, giving the Eagles a chance to add to their lead.\n\nKansas City's drive only went for nine yards over five plays, but of greater concern is Patrick Mahomes' health. The QB has been dealing with a high ankle sprain and limped off the field at the end of the possession.\n\nThe Eagles have the ball at the Philadelphia 43 with 1:22 left in the second quarter.\n\nEagles bounce back from turnover, regain lead vs. Chiefs\n\nIt didn't take Jalen Hurts long to bounce back from his turnover.\n\nHurts rushed for his second touchdown of the game to top off a 12-play, 75-yard drive and give the Eagles a 21-14 lead at State Farm Stadium in Glendale in Super Bowl 57.\n\nThe key play on the drive? A 28-yard run from Hurts on 4th & 5 at the Chiefs 44.\n\nThe Chiefs also forced a neutral zone infraction on the Eagles on fourth & 2 at the 8-yard line on the drive.\n\nThe drive took 7:19.\n\nHurts has rushed 10 times for 61 yards and two scores.

Isiah Pacheco lost three yards on first down, and JuJu Smith-Schuster only gained five yards on a catch on second down.\n\nA Patrick Mahomes pass to Smith-Schuster on third down fell incomplete.\n\nThe Eagles now have a prime opportunity to put some distance between them and the Chiefs, with the pressure now falling on Kansas City's defense. Can it get a stop?\n\nSecond quarter starts with a bang for Eagles\n\nJalen Hurts just threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to A.J.

Gamers played out the game on Madden NFL 23. Players were asked questions — only a fraction of which were related to the Super Bowl or football in general.\n\nAmong the questions were:\n\nWhich of your teammates would you want on your side in a fight? This was a frequent topic.\n\nWho would win a grizzly bear or tiger? Most players picked the grizzly.\n\nWhat's your favorite Rihanna song? Don't have one? Name any song at all.\n\nWhat would you be if you weren't an NFL player? Someone who will avoid being named admitted they would likely be in prison.\n\nWhat was your favorite moment of the season?

People waited for an hour or more to see all the NFL bling, and were able to get up close to the silver, gold and precious stones.\n\nThere was just one problem – two of the New York Giants’ rings were out of sequence.\n\nThe ring exhibit displays them in chronological order, starting with the Green Bay Packers’ rings from the first two Super Bowls and ending with the Rams’ jewelry from last season.\n\nThe rings for the Giants’ first two Super Bowls, from the 1986 and 1990 seasons, were swapped. After the Bears’ ring from their 1985 “Super Bowl Shuffle” season, you see the Giants’ ring from Super Bowl XXV. That ring features two diamonds, for both of New York’s wins under coach Bill Parcells.\n\nThe ring from Super Bowl XXI comes after the ones for XXII, XXIII and XXIV. This one is fairly distinctive because it has the Lombardi Trophy, made up by 10 diamonds, sitting on a large sapphire background. The Lombardi Trophy carries a little extra significance for the Giants because the man for whom it was named was the team’s offensive coordinator the last time New York had won the NFL title, 1956. (That could be coincidental, but it’s a nice touch.)\n\nIt did not appear any of the other rings were out of sequence. The NFL Experience is closed (except for the NFL Shop, naturally) until Thursday, so there’s time for someone to make this right.\n\n− Mark Faller\n\nReach Jeremy Cluff at jeremy.cluff@arizonarepublic.com.

But would the Bengals answer? Three-time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald ensured Cincinnati wouldn’t when he wrapped up Burrow on 4th-and-1 to seal the win with 39 seconds to play.\n\n“For the offense to be able to find a way and Aaron to finish it off,” head coach Sean McVay said, “is poetic.”\n\nIt was the Rams’ second Super Bowl title in franchise history, with the first coming in 2000.\n\nWith a strong presence of Rams fans in the crowd of 70,048, the team became only the second to win the Lombardi Trophy in its home stadium. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season became the first team to do it.\n\nThe victory provided at least short-term validation for the Rams’ all-in approach, with the club having traded a slew of draft picks to acquire Stafford, outside linebacker Von Miller and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. for its championship run.\n\nEach acquisition contributed powerfully.\n\nStafford completed 26-of-40 passes for 283 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. He said the “up and down” game resembled the Rams’ inconsistent season and perhaps they even hearkened to Stafford’s high-octane but mistake-prone performances in a season replete with 41 touchdowns but 17 interceptions.\n\nAnd yet, like his regular-season wave, Stafford built a cushion early and would deliver late when he mattered most.\n\nThe Rams were on the board first, Stafford hitting fellow 2021 acquisition Beckham on an airborne 17-yard touchdown with 6:22 to play in the first quarter. He’d strike again as Kupp faked a block before hauling in an 11-yard touchdown in the second quarter.\n\nBut the momentum swung shortly before halftime. Beckham attempted a crossing route akin to one on which he’d earlier raced upfield to net a 35-yard gain. Not so this time. Facing third-and-9, with 3:54 to play in the first half, Beckham dropped a pass and clutched his left knee. He wouldn’t return to the game.\n\nStafford heaved a prayer on third-and-14 later in the drive, and Bengals safety Jessie Bates III instead intercepted in the end zone. Cincinnati couldn’t convert before halftime but needed just one play in the third quarter to unload.\n\nLeave it to Burrow to unleash a bomb toward receiver Tee Higgins down the left sideline, and Higgins capitalized for a 75-yard touchdown after Rams All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey lost his footing on a play Ramsey seemed to have expected a flag on for a facemask. Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie stole a tipped pass the following play, Stafford’s second interception in short time. The Bengals extended their lead with a field goal, their 4-point lead almost enough to sustain a late-game punting fest.\n\nBut seven sacks, not including the final wrap-up by Donald, proved too much for Burrow and the Bengals to overcome. Burrow completed 22-of-33 passes for 263 yards including the 75-yard touchdown. He made no mistakes. But Stafford and Kupp punctuated the performance late. Burrow and his Bengals failed to answer.\n\nCincinnati running back Joe Mixon notched a game-high 72 yards rushing on 15 attempts in addition to completing a lone pass for a 6-yard touchdown to Higgins on a trick play, Cincinnati’s first score of the day. Mixon’s ground game nearly doubled the entire Los Angeles output, the Rams sputtering with just 1.9 yards per attempt and a total of 42 yards in the win.\n\nThey overcame the brick wall encountered on the ground with well-timed passing success and a nasty pass rush. Miller and Donald each sacked Burrow twice, the Bengals' offensive line withstanding the Rams early but ultimately faltering in what had seemed like the game’s decisive mismatch.\n\nBurrow and Stafford each limped off the field at points, Burrow sustaining seven crushing sacks to cap off a postseason that began with him often on the ground.\n\nAnd with one last chance, down by three, Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald delivered the game-crushing sack. Stafford had punctuated his performance. Burrow couldn’t answer.\n\nAt 36, Rams head coach Sean McVay became the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl. The previous youngest was Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. He was 36 when the Steelers won the Super Bowl in 2009 with a 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals but was about 10 months older than McVay.\n\nDespite the Bengals’ inspired one-year turnaround – they finished 4-11-1 in 2020 and this year went 10-7 and won the AFC North title before their postseason run – they remain one of 12 NFL franchises never to have won a Super Bowl.\n\n— Josh Peter and Jori Epstein\n\nBuffalo Bills, Kansas CIty Chiefs early Super Bowl favorites for next season\n\nThe glory of the Rams’ thrilling victory over the Bengals in Super Bowl 56 is still coursing through the hearts of the victors.\n\nAnd now everyone else in the league renews a dream of hope they’ll win Super Bowl 57 in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nOn Sunday night, Tipico Sportsbook unveiled its future-book odds for next season, with the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs slotted as +650 co-favorites.\n\n-- Lance Pugmire\n\nRams WR Van Jefferson and wife welcome Super Bowl Sunday baby\n\nVan Jefferson raced through the tunnels of SoFi Stadium after the game, his backpack slung over his right shoulder and his Super Bowl jersey hanging from his right hand.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams receiver was fresh off a 23-20 Super Bowl 56 victory. Now, it was time for his family to greet their newest addition.\n\nJefferson’s wife, Samaria, knew such a star-crossed delivery was possible. Samaria was determined to attend her husband’s Super Bowl even at 40 weeks pregnant, she told The Athletic’s Jourdan Rodrigue.\n\nSamaria made it to SoFi Stadium for kickoff. She left in labor midgame.\n\nLater on Sunday night, Jefferson posted a photo to Instagram of him holding his newborn baby.\n\n-- Jori Epstein\n\nLions fans, players happy for Matthew Stafford's success\n\nDetroit Lions fans had a vested interest in Super Bowl 56.\n\nNot only did former Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford lead the Rams to a 23-20 win with a patented come-from-behind victory, but the Lions' extra first-round draft pick, coming from LA via the Stafford trade, hung on the game result.\n\nBecause the Rams were able to pull out the victory, the Lions have the final pick of the first round and now three selections in the first 34 spots.\n\nBut that's in April. For now, Lions fans and former teammates had a chance to live vicariously through ol' \"No. 9.\"\n\nAnd they celebrated almost as hard as Stafford did.\n\n-- Kirkland Crawford, Detroit Free Press\n\nOpinion: Even in defeat, Joe Burrow shows he has championship mettle\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. – Joe Burrow played well enough to win in his first Super Bowl.\n\nOne problem: The phenomenal young Cincinnati Bengals quarterback lost.\n\nThis setback, a 23-20 nail-biter against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium, was not on Burrow. He tried mightily to lift his team across the finish line, as you knew he would.\n\nIt’s just tough to win when you can feel the hot breath and stiff hits from guys like Aaron Donald, Von Miller and A’Shawn Robinson all game long. Burrow was sacked seven times and still nearly led the Bengals to a Super Bowl triumph for what would have been the first time in franchise history.\n\nMaybe next time. One thing is for certain: The Bengals' primary objective for the offseason is identified, loud and clear. Build the O-line. Invest heavily. Give Joe Cool the protection that will bring out the best in a quarterback who is already good enough, surely, to almost win a Super Bowl.\n\n-- Jarrett Bell\n\nChiefs players troll Bengals' Eli Apple after Super Bowl loss\n\nCincinnati Bengals cornerback Eli Apple may have got the upper hand on the Kansas City Chiefs after defeating them in the AFC championship game, but Chiefs players may have gotten the last laugh after some called out Apple on his performance in the Bengals' 23-20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl 56.\n\nIn the AFC title game, Apple made a game-turning play at the end of the first half that proved to be critical to Cincinnati's 27-24 victory.\n\nTwo weeks later, it looks like numerous Chiefs players did not forget those comments, as Apple was called for a pass interference late in the fourth quarter and was in coverage on Cooper Kupp during the game-winning touchdown pass.\n\nKansas City receiver Mecole Hardman reminded Apple he has something the Bengals defender doesn't: a Super Bowl ring. And that was just the start of it.\n\n-- Jordan Mendoza\n\nRams defensive back Taylor Rapp proposes after Super Bowl win\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams won the Super Bowl, but safety Taylor Rapp secured another kind of victory after the game: gaining a fiancée.\n\nAs the Rams celebrated the 23-20 win with their families on the field, Rapp was with his longtime girlfriend Dani Johnson. After the two embraced, Rapp got down on one knee, pulled out a ring and asked Johnson if she would marry him as teammates watched. Johnson said yes before the two embraced once again as teammates cheered.\n\nRapp and Johnson have been together well before he played college football for Washington from 2016-2018, as the two dated when Rapp was playing high school football at Sehome High School in Bellingham, Washington.\n\nSuper Bowl takeaways: Cooper Kupp comes up clutch, Rams defense turns up the heat\n\nThe Rams provided a Hollywood ending to a blockbuster season, but it wasn't without some major plot twists.\n\nStar wide receiver Cooper Kupp delivered -- as he did all year.\n\nThe Bengals made some aggressive decisions, but ultimately succumbed to the Rams' pressure.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis takes a look at the the major takeaways from Super Bowl 56.\n\nWill Aaron Donald retire now that he's won a Super Bowl?\n\nAfter eight seasons of terrorizing nearly all NFL quarterbacks, Aaron Donald can finally add one award to his already legendary career: Super Bowl champion.\n\nBut now that arguably one of the greatest defensive linemen in the league's history finally has a Super Bowl ring for his trophy collection, will this be the last time we see Donald in a Rams uniform?\n\nDuring NBC's Super Bowl pregame coverage, former safety Rodney Harrison sai Donald had indicated to him earlier this week that he would possibly retire with a Super Bowl 56 win.\n\nFollowing the victory, Donald deflected a question about retirement from NBC reporter Michelle Tafoya.\n\n\"I'm in the moment. I'm enjoying this right now with these guys,\" Donald said as he celebrated with teammates. \"We going to play in the confetti for a minute and live in the moment.\"\n\n-- Jordan Mendoza\n\nSean McVay becomes youngest NFL coach to win Super Bowl\n\nSean McVay entered the NFL head-coaching ranks in 2017 as the youngest hire in the league's modern history at 33.\n\nNow he's beaten all his predecessors and contemporaries to another feat.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Rams' 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday in Super Bowl 56 at SoFi Stadium, McVay becomes the youngest coach ever to win a Super Bowl. McVay, who is 36 years and 20 days old on Sunday, tops the Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin, who was 36 years, 10 months and 18 days old when his team beat the Arizona Cardinals to cap the 2008 season.\n\nMcVay defeated former pupil Zac Taylor, 38, in what marked the youngest matchup of coaches in Super Bowl history.\n\n-- Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz\n\nCooper Kupp named Super Bowl 56 MVP\n\nIt was a fitting conclusion to a historic season for Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp.\n\nHe led the NFL this year in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. And then in the biggest game of them all, Kupp's 1-yard touchdown reception provided the game-winning score in his team's comeback victory.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kupp -- who caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns, and also contributed a key 7-yard run on 4th-and-1 to keep the Rams' game-winning drive alive -- was named the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nFan tackled after running on SoFi Stadium field\n\nAfter the Cincinnati Bengals' Chidobe Awuzie intercepted Matthew Stafford early in the third quarter of Super Bowl 56, a fan was seen running across the SoFi Stadium field, beginning at the east end of the field.\n\nThe fan, who was fully clothed, was wearing a Super Bowl 56 sweatshirt and holding a banner\n\nThe streaker made it almost the length of the field before being tackled by security near the 10-yard line.\n\n-- Jordan Mendoza\n\nTee Higgins' 75-yard TD catch ties for sixth-longest in Super Bowl history\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow went for the quick strike. On the receiving end, wideout Tee Higgins outfought Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey for the ball and took it all the way into the end zone for a 75-yard touchdown.\n\nWhile impressive, Higgins catch didn't make it into the top five longest touchdown receptions in Super Bowl history. The longest was an 85-yarder from Jake Delhomme to Muhsin Muhammad of the Carolina Panthers against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 38.\n\nStatistical leaders for the first half of Super Bowl 56\n\nThe Rams led the Bengals 13-10 at halftime, with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading the way on the stat sheet.\n\nStafford completed 12-of-18 passes for 165 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the first half. Odell Beckham Jr. led the Rams with two catches for 52 yards and a TD before he left with an injury. Cooper Kupp caught three passes for 40 yards and a touchdown. Cam Akers led the Rams in rushing with seven carries for 10 yards.\n\nFor the Bengals, quarterback Joe Burrow matched Stafford's 12-for-18 line for 114 yards.

Joe Mixon rushed for 40 yards on seven carries and threw a 6-yard touchdown pass.\n\nDr. Dre headlines Super Bowl 56 halftime extravaganza\n\nThe Super Bowl is more than just the biggest football game of the year.\n\nWhile the annually televised event may be the crown jewel in the pantheon of American sports, it’s also a showcase for iconic musical performances.\n\nThis year, a lineup of hip-hop heavyweights, led by N.W.A. rapper and producer Dr. Dre, is filling the slot at this year’s halftime show.\n\nRappers Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem, along with the “Queen of Hip-Hop Soul” Mary J. Blige, are joining Dre for the performance, as teased in a nearly 4-minute trailer that dropped last month.\n\n-- Edward Segarra and Charles Trepany\n\nInactive Bengals player penalized for taunting\n\nIt's never good when you cost your team yardage by going onto the field in street clothes to celebrate an interception.\n\nCornerback Vernon Hargreaves joined his teammates in doing \"The Griddy\" after Cincinnati Bengals safety Jessie Bates III's interception of Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford near the end of the first half of Super Bowl 56.\n\nAdding insult to injury, NBC's Al Michaels called out Hargreaves -- among the Bengals' inactive players for the game - and added, \"He may be inactive for a while after this scene.\"\n\nA taunting penalty gave the Bengals the ball at their own 10 instead of the 20.\n\n-- Dave Clark, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. injures knee in second quarter, will not return\n\nFor most of the half, Odell Beckham Jr. seemed to turn back time in the Super Bowl.\n\nTwo spectacular catches, 52 yards, a touchdown.\n\nThen came the scream, the wince, the grab of his left knee, the dreaded non-contact injury as the pain overwhelmed him too much to secure a near catch on second-and-9 with 3:54 to play in the second quarter.\n\nThe Rams initially said his return was questionable, but he was downgraded to out in the second half.\n\n-- Jori Epstein\n\nRELATED: Beckham tosses Super Bowl gloves to Kanye West\n\nBengals RB Joe Mixon tosses TD pass, call it a 'Cincy Special'?\n\nBengals running back Joe Mixon did his best Joe Burrow impression in the second quarter, tossing the first touchdown pass of his career, a 6-yarder to wide receiver Tee Higgins.\n\nMixon helped move the Bengals into scoring position with his legs, but on a second-and-goal play, he took a pitch from Burrow and swung wide enough to give him a perfect passing lane to Higgins.\n\nThe touchdown, with 5:47 left before halftime, cut the Bengals' deficit to 13-10. It made Mixon the fifth non-quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl. The last time it happened was the famous \"Philly Special\" when Philadelphia Eagles tight end Trey Burton connected with quarterback Nick Foles to spark a win over the New England Patriots four years ago.\n\nJa'Marr Chase makes instant impact with spectacular catch\n\nThe Bengals nearly answered the Rams' first touchdown with one of their own in the final minute of the first quarter.\n\nAlthough they had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by Evan McPherson, the Bengals score was set up by a 46-yard pass from quarterback Joe Burrow to rookie wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase.\n\nWorking against veteran Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey, Chase worked his way down the sideline to make a spectacular one-handed catch.\n\nWho will be the star of Super Bowl 56?\n\nThere are so many different potential storylines for this year's Super Bowl, from the quarterback battle to the coaching showdown between former teacher and pupil. Perhaps three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald going up against the Bengals' maligned line will be the difference in the game.

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl. Follow for the latest live updates and news from The Associated Press. All times MST.\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes has a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go with his regular season MVP, and the Kansas City Chiefs are once again hoisting the Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nMahomes was named the game’s MVP in a postgame ceremony after a gutsy performance that included 182 yards passing and three touchdowns. He played the entire game despite a right ankle injury that obviously limited how well he could move.\n\n“There was nothing that was going to keep me off the football field,” Mahomes said as Chiefs fans celebrated at State Farm Stadium.\n\nIt’s the second time in four seasons that the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl. Mahomes was asked if Kansas City’s recent run of success could be called a dynasty, and the quarterback said no because “we’re not done yet.”\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are the winners of Super Bowl 57.\n\nMahomes — hobbling around on a hurt ankle — led the Chiefs downfield for the winning drive that was capped by Harrison Butker’s 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left, sealing a 38-35 victory.\n\n“He's the MVP,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said about Mahomes. “That's all that needs to be said. MVP. And you saw it tonight.”\n\nThe Eagles took the ensuing kickoff but there would be no miracle. Jalen Hurts’ desperation heave on the final play fell way short of the end zone, and the Chiefs’ celebration began.\n\nThe Chiefs won the Super Bowl for the second time in four seasons. They beat the 49ers following the 2019 season before losing to the Buccaneers after 2020. This time, they trailed for most of the evening before rallying in the second half to beat the Eagles.\n\nIt’s a tough loss for Philadelphia, which got a great performance from quarterback Jalen Hurts, who threw for 304 yards and ran for three touchdowns.\n\nMahomes, who was named the AP NFL MVP on Thursday, threw for three touchdowns. The Chiefs overcame a 10-point halftime deficit and never led until taking a 28-27 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\n8:00 p.m.\n\nThe scoring won’t stop at the Super Bowl, and it’s getting down to the wire.\n\nThe Eagles tied the game at 35 with 5:15 remaining when Jalen Hurts scored his third rushing touchdown of the night on a 2-yard run. The quarterback then also ran for the crucial 2-point conversion that tied the game.\n\nHurts continues his brilliant performance in his first Super Bowl, throwing for 304 yards and a touchdown while also running for three scores.\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nKansas City’s Kadarius Toney turned in a crucial play for Kansas City early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Chiefs forced the Eagles to punt and Toney was there to catch it, breaking a few tackles before reversing field, where he had a convoy of Chiefs players waiting to provide blocking.\n\nToney made it 65 yards, all the way down to the Eagles 5-yard line, before getting knocked out of bounds. Three plays later, Mahomes hit a wide open Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown and a 35-27 lead.\n\nToney also had the touchdown catch that put the Chiefs ahead 28-27 earlier in the fourth.\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nRihanna was pregnant with her second child as she performed her Super Bowl halftime show Sunday.\n\nThe singer’s representative confirmed the pregnancy shortly after she ended her 13-minute set at Super Bowl 57.\n\nThe baby bump that was visible in the tight clothes she wore under her baggy red jumpsuit during the show set off a wave of social media speculation that she might be pregnant again.\n\nThe 34-year-old has a 9-month-old son with rapper A$AP Rocky.\n\n7:35 p.m.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have taken their first lead of the night.\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Kadarius Toney, pushing the Chiefs ahead 28-27 with 12:04 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nMahomes has bounced back nicely after hobbling off the field late in the second quarter. He appeared to re-aggravate an ankle injury that’s been bothering him throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe veteran QB has still been very good, completing 17 of 22 passes for 161 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nMeanwhile, players from both teams have been struggling to keep their footing on a slippery playing surface, leading several to change their cleats.\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are clinging to a 27-21 lead in the Super Bowl as the game moves to the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Eagles had a 24-14 halftime lead, but the Chiefs responded with a touchdown on the opening drive of the third quarter to pull within 24-21. Philadelphia pushed ahead 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third after Jake Elliott made a 33-yard field goal.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has been stellar in his first Super Bowl appearance, completing 22 of 31 passes for 234 yards, one passing touchdown and two rushing touchdowns. His 66 yards rushing are the most ever by a QB in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Eagles are trying to win their second Super Bowl in six seasons. The Chiefs are trying to win for the second time in four years.\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nFanDuel says it is still going to give $10 million in free bets to spread among its Super Bowl bettors.\n\nIn a much-hyped ad for betting site FanDuel customers, Rob Gronkowski attempted a 25-yard field goal. A voiceover said he missed the kick, but they’d still give out the free bets. But online, onlookers were confused and thought it was good.\n\nGronk’s “Kick of Destiny” landed the gaming site plenty of free publicity for the stunt, as well as plenty of new customers who registered to be part of the campaign.\n\n6:58 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is still pretty good with only one fully functioning ankle.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs quarterback led his team on a touchdown drive to open the third quarter. Isiah Pacheco ran for a 1-yard score to cut the Eagles’ lead to 24-21 with 9:30 left in the third quarter.\n\nMahomes appeared to re-aggravate a right ankle injury in the first half, limping off the field late in the second quarter. The injury has been bothering him throughout most of the playoffs.\n\nMahomes even ran for 14 yards on one play on the Chiefs’ scoring drive, though it was obvious he wasn’t moving quite as well as usual.\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nRihanna began her Super Bowl halftime show hanging high above the field.\n\nShe wore a puffy, bright red jumpsuit as she stood on a transparent square that moved her up and down as she hovered in the air over the turf at State Farm Stadium and belted out the lyrics to “Bitch Better Have My Money.”\n\nDancers wearing what looked like white ski suits moved in sync on their own suspended platforms.\n\nShe and her dancers were lowered to a stage that matched her outfit, and moved in sync as she sped through two other hits, “Where Have You Been,” and “Only Girl,” belting out “Want you to make me feel like I’m the only girl in the world.”\n\n6:17 p.m.\n\nAre you not entertained?\n\nThe first half of Super Bowl 57 was an action-packed doozy as the Philadelphia Eagles took a 24-14 lead over the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Jake Elliott made a 35-yard field goal at the halftime buzzer to put the Eagles up by 10.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts ran for two touchdowns in the first half and also connected on a 45-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Brown. Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes also threw a touchdown pass and Nick Bolton returned a fumble 36 yards for another score.\n\nAn important development to watch: Mahomes limped off the field late in the second quarter. The two-time NFL MVP has been fighting a badly sprained right ankle and looked like he re-aggravated the injury.\n\n5:55 p.m.\n\nJalen Hurts made up for a costly mistake earlier in the second quarter with his second rushing touchdown of the evening a few minutes later.\n\nHurts ran 4 yards for the touchdown and a 21-14 lead as the pro-Eagles crowd chanted “MVP! MVP!” Hurts was the AP NFL MVP runner-up to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes.\n\nA few minutes before his TD, Hurts fumbled around midfield and Kansas City’s Nick Bolton recovered the fumble and ran it 36 yards for a touchdown, which tied the game at 14.\n\nHurts is already putting together a solid Super Bowl. He joins Jim McMahon as the only quarterbacks with two TD runs in a Super Bowl. His 61 yards rushing are already third-most for a QB in a Super Bowl behind Steve McNair and Colin Kaepernick.\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nIt’s a tie game again at Super Bowl 57 after a stunning scoop and score by Kansas City linebacker Nick Bolton.\n\nThe Eagles were in control with the ball and a 14-7 lead but Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts fumbled on third down around midfield. Bolton was there to grab the football and ran 36 yards untouched to the end zone.\n\nThe score was 14-14 with 9:39 left in the first half.\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nBrittney Griner is in the crowd representing the Philadelphia Eagles at the Super Bowl.\n\nIt was the third public appearance for the WNBA star since her release from a Russian prison.\n\nGriner has said she’ll play for the Phoenix Mercury again this season, although she’s still an unsigned free agent. She hasn’t talked about her international future and potentially playing in the Olympics next year in Paris.\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have taken the lead again thanks to a big strike from Jalen Hurts to A.J. Brown.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts lofted a 45-yard throw toward the end zone. Brown outmaneuvered the scrambling Kansas City defense before catching the ball and then raising his arms to flex his muscles.\n\nThe Eagles lead 14-7.\n\nHurts — the AP NFL MVP runner-up to Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes — is off to a good start in his first Super Bowl. He’s 8-of-10 passing for 116 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nThe Super Bowl has settled down after a frantic start.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are tied at 7 after the first quarter. The teams exchanged touchdowns on their opening offensive drives before each team’s defense recovered.\n\nThe Chiefs had a slight edge in the first quarter with 112 total yards to the Eagles’ 99. The Chiefs are averaging 9.3 yards per play.\n\nKansas City missed an opportunity to take a lead late in the first quarter when Harrison Butker’s 42-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright.\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nIn its first Super Bowl ad, Dunkin’ Donuts enlisted superfan Ben Affleck and wife Jennifer Lopez for its spot.\n\nIn the ad, Affleck mans the drive-through booth at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Medford, Massachusetts and shocks customers. Finally, Lopez comes through the drive-through and asks Ben what he’s doing. “You’re embarrassing me in front of my friends,” he says. “Grab me a glazed” she demands.\n\nAffleck has a long association with the brand, often spotted carrying Dunkin’ Donuts drinks in paparazzi photos. He directed the ad, too.\n\n5:02 p.m.\n\nOffense rules so far in at this Super Bowl.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tied the game at 7 midway through the first quarter when Patrick Mahomes found Travis Kelce on a beautiful fade route to the back corner of the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown.\n\nThe drive went 75 yards on just six plays. Rookie Isiah Pacheco had 29 yards rushing in the drive.\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles wasted little time taking a lead.\n\nQuarterback Jalen Hurts ran for a 1-yard touchdown to cap an efficient opening drive that traveled 75 yards on 11 plays. DeVonta Smith was Hurts’ favorite target on the drive, catching three passes for 41 yards.\n\nThe Eagles are the first team to take the opening kickoff in the Super Bowl and drive for a touchdown on offense since Super Bowl 32 when the Green Bay Packers did it against the Denver Broncos 25 years ago.\n\nThe Chicago Bears also scored on Devin Hester’s kickoff return for a TD in Super Bowl 41.\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nThe Super Bowl is officially underway.\n\nThe Chiefs won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball to start the second half. That means the Philadelphia Eagles have the first offensive possession.\n\nKansas City’s kicker Harrison Butker booted the opening kickoff through the back of the end zone and the Eagles started with the ball on their own 25-yard-line.\n\nThe retractable roof is open and the weather is essentially perfect, with temperatures in the 70s. The Chiefs and Eagles both have plenty of fans in Arizona, but it’s a decidely pro-Philadelphia crowd.\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nCountry musician and songwriter Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem for Super Bowl.\n\nThe Super Bowl might be known for its extravagance, but the anthem was anything but fancy. All that was needed was a Stapleton’s smooth baritone voice and a guitar. Deaf actor Troy Kotsur — who won an Oscar for the movie “CODA” — signed the anthem alongside Stapleton.\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni and starting center Jason Kelce both had tears in their eyes during Stapleton’s emotional performance.\n\nBefore Stapleton stepped to the microphone, Grammy Award winner Babyface performed “America The Beautiful.”\n\nThe series of pregame canonical songs began with “Abbott Elementary” star Sheryl Lee Ralph performing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song that’s been dubbed the Black national anthem.\n\nRalph, wearing a flowing red velvet gown, began the song as a reflective ballad, and it became a soaring hymn as it went on, with military-style drums joining her and a choir dressed all in white chiming in behind her.\n\nPLACE YOUR BETS\n\nThere will be plenty of action on the football field Sunday. And at the casinos.\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the biggest sports betting days of the year, especially now that about two-thirds of the country can do so legally.\n\nSome of the most popular bets are also the most straightforward: The Eagles are favored by 1 1/2 points, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The site’s over-under is currently set at 51 1/2 points.\n\nSportsbooks have also taken advantage of the increasing popularity of prop bets, which range from the team who wins the coin flip, to who scores the first touchdown, to whether the game goes to overtime.\n\nYou can even bet on the color of Gatorade used when the winning coach is given his postgame bath.\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nDamar Hamlin is at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills safety made his third public appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week, this time on the field at State Farm Stadium prior to Sunday’s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIt’s another step in Hamlin’s remarkable recovery. It’s been a little more than a month since Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.\n\nHe also appeared on stage at “NFL Honors” on Thursday night after the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals training and medical staffs, along with the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, were recognized.\n\n3:40 p.m.\n\nThis is not the moment for the cable to go out in Philly, but here we are.\n\nComcast spokesperson Jen Bilotta said physical damage that severed fiberoptic cable in the Kensington section of northeast Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon resulted in an outage affecting a few thousand households in the Kensington and Fishtown neighborhoods and some surrounding areas.\n\nShe said crews have been “working furiously” for several hours to resolve the problem and some customers have started to come back online — they are hoping to restore service to everyone by kickoff.\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY\n\nFor the first time, young aspiring football players all over the world will get to watch two Black quarterbacks face each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nAP NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes leads Kansas City against the MVP runner-up, Jalen Hurts. The significance isn’t lost on Mahomes.\n\n“I think about it a lot,” Mahomes said. “The quarterbacks that came before me — Shack Harris, Doug Williams — that laid the foundation for me to be in this position. It goes across all sports. If you think about Jackie Robinson and the people who broke the color barrier in baseball, I wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for them.\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nArryn Siposs is active for the Philadelphia Eagles and will handle punting duties against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSiposs went on injured reserve after injuring an ankle against the Giants in December. He was activated after the Eagles beat the 49ers for the NFC championship, raising expectations that he would play in the big game.\n\nBrett Kern had been punting for the Eagles. He was inactive for the Super Bowl.\n\nThe other inactive players for Philadelphia: quarterback Ian Book, cornerback Josiah Scott, running back Trey Sermon, safety Anthony Harris, linebacker Kyron Johnson and wide receiver Greg Ward.\n\nInactive for the Chiefs: quarterback Shane Buechele, running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, defensive ends Josh Kaindoh and Malik Herring, tight end Blake Bell and offensive linemen Austin Reiter and Darian Kinnard.\n\nSUPER BROS\n\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, a pair of siblings will play each other on the NFL’s grandest stage.\n\nTravis Kelce helped the Kansas City Chiefs return to their third championship game in four seasons, while brother Jason has the Eagles back for the second time in six years.\n\n“Cool scenario to be in, you know?” Travis Kelce said. “My mom can’t lose.”\n\nDonna Kelce said on Thursday before the “NFL Honors” show that she did her best to keep up with her two sons’ voracious appetites, but it was easier said than done.\n\n“The refrigerator was always packed, but it didn’t last more than a day or so,” she said. “Whole chickens, they would eat lots of pork, ribs. I’d have leftovers in the refrigerator and it never lasted past the day.\n\n“When they left for college, I got a raise.”\n\nIMPORTANT DELIVERIES\n\nTony Conigliaro’s Super Bowl started long before kickoff.\n\nThe owner of Tony’s Pizza in Brooklyn said he was taking orders Saturday, a day ahead of the big game, especially for the “family deal”: a large pie, 10 wings, garlic knots, soda and other extras for $32 — delivered.\n\n“The Super Bowl is a little crazy,” said Conigliaro, who has been selling pizzas for more than 30 years. “Everybody wants to eat at the same time. That’s the problem. Everybody wants 5:30, quarter to six, six o’clock. It comes to a point that we don’t pick up the phones no more because everybody’s calling back — ‘Where’s my pizza?’”\n\nThen the game starts and his ovens cool off a bit.\n\n“Then we get busy again. What do you call it — halftime?” Conigliaro said. “The phone starts ringing.”\n\nHe estimates his staff would make 200 pizzas Sunday, but not after 8 p.m.\n\n“We just clean up and go home,” Conigliaro said.\n\nHALFTIME LOOKAHEAD\n\nRihanna has put in the work ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, focusing so hard on what she promises will be “a jam-packed show” that her upcoming birthday and Valentine’s Day almost slipped her mind.\n\n“The setlist was the biggest challenge. That was the hardest, hardest part. Deciding how to maximize 13 minutes but also celebrate — that’s what this show is going to be. It’s going to be a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together,” Rihanna said.\n\nIt’ll be her first live performance in seven years.\n\nPHILLY GIRL\n\nJill Biden is expected to be among the fans at State Farm Stadium cheering on her beloved Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe first lady grew up in suburban Philadelphia and has never been shy about her allegiance to the hometown team. She and her grandson, Hunter, were at the stadium in Philadelphia on Jan. 29 when the Eagles won the NFC championship.\n\nThe 16-year-old will join her again on Sunday.\n\nNo sitting president has attended a Super Bowl, mainly because of the strict security requirements authorities would need to impose upon the tens of thousands of fans. President Biden will be at the White House on Sunday.\n\nPresident Biden says he’s a Philadelphia sports fan, too, out of necessity, and often jokes that “I’d be sleeping alone” otherwise.\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs welcomed two new fans to the world on Super Bowl Sunday, with a third apparently on the way.\n\nChiefs offensive lineman Nick Allegretti’s wife, Christina, gave birth in the early hours to twin girls back home in Chicago, a team official confirmed to The Associated Press. Allegretti was able to watch everything unfold on FaceTime from the lobby of the team hotel while the rest of the Chiefs slept ahead of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAllegretti, who has started three games this season, will be available for the Chiefs in the big game.\n\nAbout the same time his wife was giving birth, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman tweeted that his girlfriend, Chariah Gordeon, had gone into labor. Hardman went on injured reserve this week and was not available to play in the game.\n\nThere are plenty of Eagles on baby watch, too.\n\nStarting center Jason Kelce, whose brother Travis is a tight end for Kansas City, and his wife are expecting their third child at any moment. In fact, Kylie Kelce, who is 38 weeks pregnant, has said that her obstetricians would be on hand at State Farm Stadium on Sunday should the baby make a dramatic appearance during the game.\n\nPHILLY FAITHFUL\n\nPhiladelphia native Dawn Staley donned an Eagles jersey during Sunday’s South Carolina-LSU SEC matchup of undefeated teams in women’s basketball ahead of the Super Bowl. And after her top-ranked Gamecocks rolled to an 88-64 victory, Staley was asked about the Chiefs-Eagles matchup.\n\n“The Eagles have already won,” the coach beamed. “It’s divine order.

A lot of fluff stuff.\n\nAnother Super Bowl title:Reid, Chiefs beat Eagles for Super Bowl 57 crown\n\nMahomes is MVP:Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes named Super Bowl MVP\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now for exclusive content sent to your inbox\n\nDuring the two Reid sessions that I attended this week, which included the presence of dozens of national and international journalists, no one bothered to ask about the tragic incident that occurred three days before the Chiefs were last in the Super Bowl in February 2021. Or the aftermath of an accident caused by a then-Chiefs assistant coach, Reid’s drunken son, Britt, that left a then-5-year-old girl, Ariel Young, fighting for her life.\n\nThe matchup pitting Reid and the Chiefs against the franchise he coached for 14 years, the Philadelphia Eagles, is a big reason why he is one of the most compelling storylines of Super Bowl 57. Reid is 3-0 against the Eagles since continuing his Hall of Fame-credentialed career in Kansas City, and he readily acknowledges the sentimental twist added to the game on Sunday at State Farm Stadium that features the teams who shared the NFL’s best record this season.\n\n“Once the game gets going, it’s football,” Reid said. “Who’s got the better team? Better players? Better coaches? Who gets a break, here or there? All the things that normally happen in a football game.”\n\nStill, the tragedy that marred the ramp-up to Kansas City’s last Super Bowl appearance should not be ignored – as much as the Chiefs and the NFL seemingly would want it to just go away.\n\nBritt Reid is in prison now, serving a plea-bargained three-year sentence after pleading guilty to felony driving while intoxicated resulting in serious physical injury. Then a Chiefs linebackers coach, he left the team’s headquarters the night of Feb. 4, where court documents suggest he had consumed alcohol, and rammed his truck into two vehicles that were idled on the shoulder of I-435 near Arrowhead Stadium. He had a serum blood alcohol concentration of 0.113 approximately two hours later, well above the Missouri limit of 0.08. According to police, his truck was speeding at 84 mph in a 65 mph zone, and he admitted to an officer that he had mixed alcohol with the prescription drug Adderall.\n\nYoung was sitting in the back of one of the vehicles that Reid struck and suffered a traumatic brain injury after being pinned behind the driver’s seat. She was in a coma for 11 days and hospitalized for two months. Thank God that she survived. Yet at the sentencing hearing for Reid in November, Young’s mother, Felicia Miller, told the court that while her daughter’s condition has improved, she will have to deal with the impact of the crash for the rest of her life.\n\n“The positive thing is that the little girl is doing better. A lot better,” Andy Reid told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s the positive of this whole thing.”\n\nReid, always one of the most engaging and approachable coaches in the NFL, responded to a handful of questions following one of his media sessions this week. As he prepares to coach in his third Super Bowl in four seasons, surely it wasn’t the ideal topic for him. But it’s fair game, given his high-profile role in the public eye – and the connection to his job with the Chiefs.\n\nAnd it’s also apparent that the manner in which Reid has handled crisis is part of the example that he has set as a coach and leader, earning him tremendous respect and empathy.\n\nWhen asked for a lasting impression of Reid from the crisis before the last Super Bowl appearance, defensive end Frank Clark told USA TODAY Sports, “The main thing I learned about Coach Reid was just his grit. His will to keep on going, no matter what the situation.”\n\nThe NFL, which previously said it would review the case under the umbrella of its personal conduct policy – which it vigorously pursues regarding issues involving players – has not publicly released any findings from the review and did not respond to an inquiry from USA TODAY Sports this week.\n\nThe Chiefs engaged in an undisclosed settlement with Young’s family that covers medical and, conceivably, other expenses.\n\nReid, who lost his son, Garrett, to an accidental heroin overdose in 2012 while working on his father’s staff with the Eagles, hired Britt to his Chiefs staff despite scant experience that basically consisted of one year of coaching at the high school level. Like the conditions of the plea-bargained sentence that reportedly outraged Young’s family, the hire that led to Britt joining the Chiefs raises serious questions about privilege. Britt came to the Chiefs with a record that included previous jail time stemming from drug abuse, a road rage incident and had undergone drug rehab treatment.\n\nThe compassionate efforts by Reid to help his son – much like he provided a second chance to Michael Vick after the star quarterback served his prison sentence for dogfighting – were noble enough. But the opportunity afforded Britt that many qualified candidates don’t get a chance at, backfired.\n\n“Britt will do his time and he’ll be back and get back on his feet,” Reid told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nIt must be tough to separate the non-football issues related to the tragedy from his job.\n\n“You’ve got to do the best you can,” Reid said. “Absolutely. It’s all part of life.”\n\nWhen Reid lost his son, Garrett, while he coached the Eagles, he came back to work days after the death. The auto accident involving Britt was obviously a different circumstance, but it forced Reid to compartmentalize on the eve of coaching in one of the biggest games of his life.\n\nHow did he try to reconcile what happened?\n\n“Tried to stay focused on the job the best I could,” Reid told USA TODAY Sports. “There was a little girl involved, too. My son was hurt. She was hurt. For that time being, you’ve got to put that distraction aside the best you can.”\n\nDistraction. For the most affected victims, it was so much deeper than that. Yet that form of “coach speak” might also reflect why players and staff members describe Reid as a rock of consistency while employing a certain type of tunnel vision. In Reid’s case, though, his personal challenges have made him more human with the men he is charged to lead. The humanism that makes Reid such a hit on the podium works behind closed doors, too, in relating to players.\n\n“We can look at the (head) coach title and think that this person is so out of touch with reality, so out of reach, but he’s a normal person,” Clark said. “He goes through normal things. You look at the course of his career, he’s had real-life situations, dealing with players, dealing with his own kids, his own family and the situation (before Super Bowl 55). Eventually, does it affect the man? I’m sure it does.\n\n“It just shows his grit to continue to come in here, smiling in our faces, he’s giving us everything that we want. He’s not short-changing us with the coaching, either. He’s giving it all to his players.”\n\nLike Clark, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce saw another dimension of Reid’s persona revealed through the crisis in early 2021. The accident occurred the night before the Chiefs flew to Tampa for Super Bowl 55, their departure later in the week than usual for a Super Bowl team due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n“I learned how strong of a guy he is,” Kelce told USA TODAY Sports. “Mentally, how strong his family is, how tight-knit this entire locker room is and how much we love that guy, man. It wasn’t an easy time for him and we’re definitely trying to make this year that much better. I’ve got to get another one for Big Red, man. I love that guy too much.”\n\nThe Chiefs lost Super Bowl 55 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it wasn’t even close. Kelce insists that the sudden crisis dealt to Reid and the team had no impact on the 31-9 result.\n\n“All you saw in that game was how we played on that field,” Kelce said. “I don’t think anything like that got in the way.”\n\nYet the tragedy was still part of the storyline.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/sport/rams-buccaneers-nfl-week-9-preview-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "NFL Week 9 Preview: How to watch and all you need to know | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe two most recent Super Bowl winners face off on Sunday when the Los Angeles Rams (3-4) travel south to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-5).\n\nThis will be just the eighth time in the past 20 seasons that the two most recent Super Bowl champions will meet in the regular season.\n\nTwo seasons ago, the Bucs defeated Patrick Mahomes’ Chiefs to win Super Bowl LV.

Abbie Parr/AP Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was taken off the field on a stretcher during the game against the Cincinnati Bengals, after suffering apparent head and neck injuries. The incident had a lot of fall out with the NFL beginning a review on allowing Tagovailoa to play, the Dolphins being criticized widely and the National Football League Players Association reportedly terminating the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who was involved in the evaluation of Tagovailoa for a concussion during their game against the Buffalo Bills. Jeff Dean/AP Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray runs in a touchdown in the fourth against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium on October 2 in Charlotte.

The Vikings won the game when the Saints' \"double doink\" kick — when the ball hits two parts of the uprights on a scoring attempt — fell short and let Minnesota return to the US with the 28-25 win. Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters The most bizarre incident of Week 3 occurred with the Miami Dolphins backed up in their own endzone. On their own one-yard line, needing to punt the ball away with restricted space available, punter Thomas Morstead kicked the ball off teammate Trent Sherfield's backside and out of bounds for a safety. Dubbed \"butt punt\" by many on social media, the flub ultimately didn't cost Miami as it won 21-19 over the Buffalo Bills.

Detroit wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown soars over Minnesota Vikings cornerback Patrick Peterson to pick up a first down at the two-yard line in the first quarter of their Week 3 clash.

Sunday's game saw the return of \"Brownie the Elf\" to the Browns' home field.

Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The best photos from the 2022 NFL season Prev Next\n\nWhat has caused these two teams to struggle?\n\nTampa Bay has been plagued with injuries since the start of the season. Most recently, starting linebacker Shaq Barrett suffered a season-ending Achilles injury.\n\nHowever, they could be welcoming back some key players in the coming weeks. The team did not make any moves before the trade deadline, leaving the assumption that they believe the current roster is competent for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Rams’ biggest struggle has been on offense. They rank 28th in the league when they have had to convert third downs of six or longer yards. To compare, they ranked third in that category last season.\n\nThey have trouble running the ball, as shown in last week’s loss to the 49ers. During that game, just 56 of 223 yards of total offense gained came on the ground.\n\nFor either team, a win this week would provide momentum heading into the second half of the season.\n\nWith both teams majorly struggling on offense, this game could be a low-scoring affair in which capitalizing on opposing mistakes is the main difference between success and failure.\n\nTune in on Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET to see which team emerges victorious.\n\nBills and Jets Clash in AFC East Showdown\n\nWeek 9 also features a divisional matchup between the Buffalo Bills (6-1) and New York Jets (5-3).\n\nThe AFC East is one of the league’s most competitive divisions, and one of two divisions (NFC East) in which all four teams have won at least four games. Buffalo enters the matchup on a four-game win streak and heavily favored against their opponent.\n\nThe game presents an interesting comparison between quarterbacks Josh Allen and Zach Wilson.\n\nIn his fifth year, Allen is having one of the best seasons of his career. He is consistently in the conversation alongside names like Mahomes and Brady regarding the league’s best signal-callers.\n\nThrough seven games, his 2,504 combined passing and rushing yards trail only Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning and Drew Brees for the most such combined yards by a quarterback in his first seven games of a season.\n\nWilson, on the other hand, has struggled at the start of his second year. His passer rating is 34th among quarterbacks who have started at least three games, and his completion percentage is tied for 35th.\n\nWilson will be seeking to emulate Allen's trajectory. Mike Stobe/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThe interesting part is that Wilson’s recent performance is reminiscent of Allen’s at the same point in his career.\n\nFor example, Wilson threw three interceptions in the Jet’s Week 8 loss to the Patriots. Allen had a nearly identical experience, throwing three interceptions and making many other mental mistakes during a Bills’ loss to the Patriots back in 2019.\n\nAllen is a shining example that not all great quarterbacks come out of the gate great; some take longer than others to sink into their role and reach their highest potential.\n\nThe rest of the season will be an indicator of whether or not Wilson is able to replicate a similar rise to eminence.\n\nThrough eight games, Wilson’s glimmers of greatness have been overshadowed by mistakes and inexperience. In a highly competitive AFC East, Wilson has the second-half of the season to prove whether or not he has the ability to be the Jets’ next franchise quarterback.\n\nTo see Wilson and Allen in action, tune in on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs Host Primetime Battle with Titans\n\nKansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes has the chance to make history on Sunday when the Chiefs (5-2) host the Tennessee Titans (5-2).\n\nThe QB has recorded a league-leading 20 touchdown passes this season and ranks fourth with 2,159 passing yards. Through 70 career games (all starts), Mahomes has totaled 21,150 passing yards and 171 touchdown passes.\n\nWith 105 passing yards against the Titans, Mahomes would surpass Matthew Stafford for the most passing yards ever by a quarterback in his first 75 career starts.\n\nPatrick Mahomes can make history on Sunday. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nWith three touchdown passes, Mahomes will surpass Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino for the most-ever by a quarterback in his first 75 career starts.\n\nThe Titans enter the matchup first in their division and on a five-game win streak. Out of the last ten meetings with Kansas City, Tennessee has won eight.\n\nKickoff is set for Sunday Night at 8:25 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nHere’s how to catch these teams and others across the league in action, from wherever you are.\n\nAustralia: NFL Game Pass, ESPN, 7Plus\n\nBrazil: NFL Game Pass, ESPN\n\nCanada: CTV, TSN, RDS, NFL Game Pass on DAZN\n\nGermany: NFL Game Pass, ProSieben MAXX, DAZN\n\nMexico: NFL Game Pass, TUDN, ESPN, Fox Sports, Sky Sports\n\nUK: NFL Game Pass, Sky Sports, ITV, Channel 5\n\nUS: NFL Game Pass, CBS Sports, Fox Sports, ESPN, Amazon Prime", "authors": ["Hannah Brewitt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}]}

He owns it all, though, dancing up a storm in what's best described as the coolest drum major outfit ever.\n\nBTS unleashes 'Butter,' screaming crowds respond\n\nAfter one of the K-pop crew shares a moment with Olivia Rodrigo, the mega-popular group launches into a performance of \"Butter\" with a whole bunch of smooth dancing to melt everyone's hearts.\n\nSilk Sonic wins song of the year for 'Leave the Door Open'\n\nQuestlove tosses out another Oscars slap joke – \"I'm going to present this award and I hope that you people stay like 500 feet away from me\" – before song of the year goes to Silk Sonic. \"Andy, I couldn't be prouder of doing this song with you,\" Bruno Mars says to partner Anderson .Paak. The duo's tune also won for R&B song and tied for R&B performance.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo breaks out the 'Drivers License,' J Balvin goes 'In da Getto'\n\nRodrigo begins seated behind the wheel of a spiffy car as she performs a tender-turned-rockin' version of her huge hit song \"Drivers License.\" She also sings walking down a faux street looking like she's lost on the way to the prom but she's emoting like a champ so it's OK. Noah jokes that Rodrigo captures \"how heartbreaking it is to go to the DMV\" before J Balvin is joined by Maria Becerra for \"Qué Más Pues?\" then launches into \"In da Getto\" with an army of dancing arms.\n\nSilk Sonic begins the Grammys show by bringing the funk\n\n\"Vegas, baby! I can smell the bad decisions up here already,\" host Trevor Noah says kicking off the Grammys broadcast on top of the MGM Grand. He sends it to the Grand Garden Arena, where Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak) plays a brassy rendition of \"777\" – and evokes some James Brown feels – in a jam that feels right at home in the land of craps tables and roulette wheels. Afterward Noah makes the first Oscars slap joke of the night: \"We're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths all night!\"\n\nSt. Vincent takes second best alternative music album Grammy\n\nA luminous St. Vincent (aka Annie Clark) talks backstage about “Daddy’s Home,” her Grammy-winning best alternative music album. “I wanted the listener to feel like they were sitting in an old leather armchair with a glass of bourbon and luxuriate in the album,” she says.\n\nPosing in a floor-length pink gown accented with feathers, St. Vincent was proud that more women have landed in the category since her 2015 win there as the first female to do so since Sinead O’Connor 20 years prior. “I’m glad the times are a-changin’,” she says.\n\nKanye West rules two rap categories, Olivia Rodrigo gets her first Grammy\n\nYe wins for best melodic rap performance \"Hurricane\" and rap song (\"Jail\" with Jay-Z) but loses the rap album Grammy to Tyler, the Creator's \"Call Me If You Get Lost.\" Rodrigo's breakout \"Drivers License\" is named best pop solo performance while Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga's \"Love for Sale\" wins for pop vocal album.\n\nFoo Fighters sweep rock Grammys in wake of Taylor Hawkins' death\n\nDave Grohl's band wins best rock performance (\"Making a Fire\"), best rock song (\"Waiting on a War\") and rock album (\"Medicine at Midnight\"). Foo Fighters were supposed to perform at the Grammys but canceled their appearance as well as the rest of their tour after drummer Hawkins died unexpectedly last month. In addition, H.E.R.'s \"Fight for You\" is named best traditional R&B performance and Silk Sonic's \"Leave the Door Open\" takes best R&B song and ties for R&B performance.\n\nCeCe Winans wins three, George Harrison's 'All Things Must Pass' anniversary album takes honor\n\nWinans pulls a hat trick and wins for gospel performance/song, contemporary Christian music performance/song and best gospel album while Carrie Underwood's \"My Savior\" is named best roots gospel album. Plus George Harrison’s “All Things Must Pass: 50th Anniversary Edition\" gets best boxed or special limited edition package, making it the first Grammy the former Beatle factored into since 2002, when “Marwa Blues,” from his final album “Brainwashed,” earned a nod for best pop instrumental performance.\n\n“This album has really endured,” his widow, Olivia Harrison, says backstage. “It’s full of hope and inspiration and good rock ‘n’ roll and great musicians. It’s George’s seminal work. He got his first Grammy 58 years ago (with The Beatles, who won best new artist) and it’s amazing that 58 years later I’m standing here. People have told me how (this music) has helped and healed them.\"\n\nJon Batiste runs his Grammy haul to four, 'Summer of Soul' gets Grammy love\n\nBatiste extends his streak, taking best music video for \"Freedom.\" \"We just wanted everybody to see it and be transformed by joy,\" he says of the video's New Orleans setting. And exactly seven days after winning best documentary at the Oscars, \"Summer of Soul\" snags the Grammy for best music film. \"What a journey for this film, from Sundance (Film Festival) until last week,\" director Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson says with a knowing laugh. (His Oscar win came directly after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock.)\n\nJoni Mitchell gets Grammy for best historical album\n\nAfter making an emotional return to the stage at Friday's MusiCares pre-Grammys tribute, Mitchell receives a Grammy for \"Joni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963-1967).\" \"I didn't expect this,\" the legendary singer says, thanking Cameron Crowe (who did the liner notes) and \"my angel,\" her physical therapist who's been helping her since she suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015.\n\nChris Stapleton, Brothers Osborne win country Grammys\n\nStapleton shouts out the house band when accepting his best country solo performance for \"You Should Probably Leave.\" \"I was really slow so they had to play a long time,\" quips Stapleton, who also takes best country song for \"Cold.\" And Brothers Osborne takes the Grammy for country duo/group performance for “Younger Me,” written in response to T.J. Osborne coming out. “I never thought I would be able to do music professionally because of my sexual orientation,” says the first openly gay artist signed to a major country label. “And I never thought I’d be onstage accepting a Grammy after something I thought would be life-changing in a negative way. (But) I am here with a man I love and who loves me back. I don’t know what I did to be so lucky.”\n\nIn addition, Batiste runs his 2022 Grammy haul to three, winning for American roots performance and roots song.\n\nThe Police drummer Stewart Copeland takes new age album Grammy\n\n\"This has got to be a first: a rock drummer in a new age category,\" says Copeland, a founding member of The Police who wins for \"Divine Tides\" with Ricky Kej. Angelique Kidjo's \"Mother Nature\" takes the Grammy for global music album and the late Chick Corea receives two honors: best improvised jazz solo for \"Humpty Dumpty (Set 2)\" and Latin jazz album for \"Mirror Mirror\" with Eliane Elias and Chucho Valdés.\n\nJon Batiste snags Grammy win for 'Soul' soundtrack\n\n\"Tell the truth, you didn't expect Kunta to be this fine, did you?\" says host LeVar Burton, the \"Star Trek\" and \"Roots\" actor, to start the Grammys preshow. He points out the global unrest of the moment but also offers a positive message: \"Music is a balm for all our souls.\"\n\nBatiste grabs his first Grammy of the day – for \"Soul,\" which ties with \"The Queen's Gambit\" for score soundtrack for visual media. Bo Burnham's \"All Eyes on Me\" snags best song for visual media, \"The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical\" wins for best musical theater album and \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\" takes the honor for compilation soundtrack for visual media.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo vs. Billie Eilish might be one for the ages\n\nTwo years after sweeping the major Grammy honors, Eilish returns with seven nominations this year, including album, song and record of the year for her “Happier Than Ever” and its title track. Rodrigo, the new kid on the scene, also has seven nods including those key categories. Plus she's favored for the prestigious best new artist – yep, which Eilish won in 2020 – against a field that includes Glass Animals, Saweetie and Eilish's own brother, Finneas.\n\nWondering how to watch the Grammy Awards?

The firm was previously known as Big Hit Entertainment.\n\nAt least two of the new titles will be shot with the entire band, including a taped concert special in Los Angeles and a behind-the-scenes documentary series. Disney expects the latter to debut next year.\n\nIn a recorded video message shared with CNN Business, the band said they were looking forward to showing fans “a more up-close and personal side of us.”\n\nBTS has enjoyed meteoric success in recent years, attracting legions of fans around the world known as the “Army.”\n\nRecently, however, the seven-person group announced that it would be taking a break to explore various projects, including some on a solo basis.\n\nThe new tie-up with Disney reflects that. One forthcoming title is a reality show that will see V, a BTS star, head on vacation with other Korean celebrities, the company said.\n\nThe band’s documentary will also peek into their daily lives “as they prepare for their second chapter,” Disney and HYBE said in a joint statement.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. The move shows how Disney (DIS) is focusing on top-tier talent as it continues to go after Netflix (NFLX) and cash in on the recent wave of popularity surrounding Korean content and culture.\n\nLast year, for example, fans worldwide buzzed over “Squid Game,” the South Korean hit from Netflix that became the company’s top show globally. Disney said it has also found success with titles like “Snowdrop,” a Korean series that has become one of its most-watched titles throughout Asia recently.\n\n“This collaboration represents our creative ambition — to work with iconic content creators and top stars in Asia-Pacific so their talent can be enjoyed by mainstream audiences in multiple ways,” Jessica Kam-Engle, Disney’s head of content for Asia Pacific, said in a statement. “We believe these new titles will captivate consumers worldwide and look forward to introducing more music content on our service.”\n\nThe move is part of a major expansion into Asian content announced by the company last October. It plans to greenlight more than 50 original titles from the region by 2023.\n\nThe Hollywood giant said at the time that it was commissioning new shows from South Korea, Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Indonesia. Many of the programs will be presented in local languages, from Bahasa Indonesia to Mandarin.\n\nNetflix has also been pouring money into original Asian language content, and touting the global success of its Korean and Japanese programs in particular.\n\nBut the company’s stock has faced pressure in recent months, after it revealed in April that it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade. The news reignited debate about long-term prospects for the streaming sector.\n\nInvestors, however, seem calmer about Disney. The company said in its most recent earnings presentation in May that it had added more Disney+ subscribers than expected over the past quarter, bringing its total to 137.7 million.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/entertainment/american-music-awards-winners-2022/index.html", "title": "American Music Awards 2022: See the winners list | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 50th American Music Awards took place on Sunday night at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nThe show, produced by dick clark productions and ABC, was hosted by Wayne Brady.\n\nThe star-studded event celebrated the year’s best music and performances, as voted on by fans.\n\nPuerto Rican performer Bad Bunny topped the list of nominees this year with the most nods, earning eight, including his first-ever for artist of the year. He ended up taking home two awards – for favorite male Latin artist and favorite Latin album, for “Un Verano Sin Ti.”\n\nThe night belonged to Taylor Swift, however, who won in all six categories for which she was nominated, including artist of the year, the night’s top honor. The wins cemented Swift as the most decorated artist in AMAs history, with 40 career wins.\n\nPerformers who took the AMA stage included Pink, who opened the show, as well as Dove Cameron, Lil Baby, Bebe Rexha, Carrie Underwood, Imagine Dragons and others.\n\nLionel Richie, a 17-time AMA winner, was honored with the Icon Award for his career contributions to the music industry. Charlie Puth, Stevie Wonder and other artists gave a heartfelt tribute performance for Richie.\n\nThe show announced some of the winners prior to the broadcast.\n\nElton John took home his first AMA win since 1988 for best collaboration with Dua Lipa, becoming the longest-recognized artist in the awards show’s history.

At Sunday's Grammy Awards, the seven men from South Korea will have more firsts. They are up for best pop duo/group performance for \"Dynamite,\" their chart-topping English-language hit. It marks the group's first nomination as well as the first for a K-pop group. They're on tap to perform and it'll be the first time they'll do so armed with one of their own songs (they had a cameo at the 2020 Grammys, but more on that later).\n\nMaking history and breaking records is nothing new for RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook.\n\nThey're the first K-pop group to debut at the top of Billboard's Hot 100. They hold the Guinness World Records for most-viewed YouTube music video in 24 hours (\"Dynamite\" hit 101 million views). They've beat their own record for the best-selling South Korean album of all time.\n\nAlong the way, they've gained a legion of fiercely loyal fans called ARMY (full disclosure: I am one of them).\n\n“We're really excited, it still feels surreal,” Jimin told USA TODAY via an interpreter. “We're still figuring out what to make of it. But we do know this is a great honor and we're deeply thankful. We're trying our best to deliver a great performance to return all the support we received from our fans.”\n\nBTS' journey to the Grammys\n\nIn 2018, during an interview with Jimmy Fallon, BTS was asked what they wanted next in their career and Suga said, “Go to the Grammys.” The rest of the boys laughed lightheartedly when Suga answered. It wasn’t the first time he had expressed this wish.\n\nA few months later, BTS flew out to attend the 2019 Grammys as presenters, where they walked the red carpet and promised they \"would be back.\"\n\nIn 2020, they made an appearance on stage during Lil Nas X's performance of \"Old Town Road.\" In a behind-the-scenes video from the event, the members reiterated how much they would love the opportunity to one day perform their own song.\n\nAnd that brings us to now. A nomination under their belt and finally a chance to perform.\n\n“(A) performance is what we wanted more, even more than a nomination or winning,” RM said. “We are a performance team, so a performance with our own song was one of our final dreams for this whole journey, so we are flattered and excited at the same time.”\n\nStill, taking home a gilded gramophone trophy would be momentous.\n\n“We've grown up watching the Grammys. It's one of the biggest awards, and a win would mean a lot for us,” said J-Hope.\n\nWhat 'Dynamite' represents now for BTS\n\nAfter nearly seven months and a list of accolades, did \"Dynamite\" fulfill its purpose to uplift fans? Absolutely, said Suga.\n\n“It's indicative of how much ARMY loves us,” he said. “We meant to give comfort with ‘Dynamite’ in the given circumstances, and we feel that many people resonated with this song even during such hardships.”\n\nFor RM, the song was a gateway to new possibilities. “For eight years, when we had hardships and very bad things from outside or inside, we always found a way, and we had this virus last year and everyone was confused and lost their way and ‘Dynamite’ gave us more than ‘Dynamite,' and now it symbolizes kind of a possibility, a stairway to another world.”\n\nWhat led BTS to the music industry leaderboard?\n\n“Of course, it’s ARMY,” Jungkook said.\n\nV also included the other members, their label BigHit Entertainment, family and friends who “have all helped us grow and advance step by step.”\n\nSuga said, “When the nominations were out and (we) were set to perform, obviously, we were filled with joy, but our fans seemed much happier than us. We always think: Would any of this have been possible without ARMY?”\n\nARMY has become a point of pride for the group, which thanks their fans for every achievement and milestone.\n\n“There are so many blessings we could’ve gotten for these eight years, but I guess for the whole journey the best luck we ever had is that we all have you guys all over the world,” RM said. “So please don’t forget that, whether we get the Grammys or not, we already got what we wanted, and we got you, so that means we got everything.”\n\nWhat’s next for BTS?\n\n2020 brought its share of ups and downs for BTS. They started the year with the release of their album “Map of the Soul: 7,” a retrospective look at their musical journey. Shortly after, due to the coronavirus pandemic, BTS had to postpone their highly anticipated world tour.\n\nLater in the year, they released a self-directed album, a more intimate and personal body of work reflecting on the pandemic, in the form of “BE.” With it, they got a second No. 1 debut on the Hot 100 with the title track “Life Goes On,” the first Korean-language song to top the chart.\n\nIn 2020, BTS was named Time's Entertainer of the Year and one of Wall Street Journal’s Innovators. They were the world's top-selling act and got the No. 1 spot on the IFPI’s Global Artists chart.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of 2021, their biggest priority is meeting ARMY again. “The vaccines started to roll out,” Jin said. “If the situation allows, our priority would be to hold a concert with our fans. Also, we're working on individual songs and meeting up for group songs as well. So stay tuned for new things to come out.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/21/bigbang-biggest-boy-band-world-you-probably-havent-heard/83197506/", "title": "BIGBANG: The biggest boy band in the world you probably haven't ...", "text": "Hoai-Tran Bui\n\nUSATODAY\n\nAs the Internet celebrates Lin Manuel-Miranda and Leonardo DiCaprio landing on the Time 100 list, a South Korean boy band was quietly beating everyone from President Barack Obama to Beyoncé on the Time 100 Most Influential of 2016 reader poll. BIGBANG is barely a household name in America, but speak their name in South Korea, and you’ll probably get screams of ardour from their countless fans.\n\nNow they’re gaining recognition in the States, with their ranking on the Time poll and their 2015 world tour stops in New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles selling out despite not releasing any records in the U.S.\n\nIt’s all very exciting for a group that is just reaching its 10th year in the music industry, but that buzz is tinged with bittersweetness, as the three oldest members of the band ready themselves for two-year mandatory military enlistment at the end of this year and next year. Despite the finality of that sentence, BIGBANG is still a boy band worth your time and your devotion.\n\nWho is BIGBANG?\n\nBIGBANG is the biggest K-pop boy band across the Pacific, but to compare them to One Direction would be unfair. Even comparing them to NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys at their peak would be unfair. For one, BIGBANG dabbles in everything from hip-hop, to R&B, electro pop and trap — and for another, they’re no longer boys.\n\nAll men in their late 20s, G-Dragon, Taeyang, T.O.P., Daesung and Seungri buck boy band convention by proving that they are each the most important member of the band.\n\nG-Dragon, the gremlin-like leader and rapper of the group who writes and produces most of the BIGBANG’s songs, has two full-length albums and several EPs — collaborating with artists like Diplo, Skrillex and Missy Elliott — while gracing the front rows of Paris fashion weeks. Lead singer Taeyang boasts two solo albums as well, and has established himself as one of the country’s foremost R&B vocalists. Deep-voiced rapper T.O.P. has formed a fairly successful movie career for himself, while the two youngest, powerhouse singer Daesung and manic mood-maker Seungri, have built out their careers in variety shows and acting.\n\nWhy should we care?\n\nBIGBANG -- unofficially called the “ kings of K-pop ” -- are old pros in the increasingly youthful K-pop industry, still beating out newbie boybands and girl groups every year in both awards and album sales. Their latest album, M.A.D.E., released in 2015 as a series of EPs, was so successful that three separate songs won “Song of the Year” at Korean awards shows.\n\nBIGBANG started out in the cog-like “idol” industry (a term for boy bands and girl groups put through rigorous training for years before they debut) before breaking out in 2008 with their self-written and self-produced songs — until then, a rarity for an “idol” group.\n\nSince then, they’ve been at the forefront of the Korean music wave, beating Britney Spears for the MTV Europe Music Awards’ “Best Worldwide Act” in 2011, cracking the Billboard 200 in 2012, and in 2015, holding the largest K-pop arena tour in U.S. history.\n\nListen to them if you like: Rihanna, The Weeknd, Diplo\n\nWhile they’re not above a good old-fashioned pop song, BIGBANG has become more known for punchy club bangers and trippy electronica. Their roots remain in emotional hip-hop though, with their first self-penned mid-tempo hit Lies still influencing their sound today. Two songs, Bae Bae and Loser from their M.A.D.E. album, embody their range from trap-influenced electro pop to acoustic-leaning hip hop.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/11/23/grammy-nominations-snubs-and-surprises-2022-awards-drake-bts-jon-batiste/8724506002/", "title": "Grammy 2022 snubs: BTS, Drake shorted; Miley Cyrus shut out", "text": "It wouldn’t be an awards show without an accompanying list of grievances.\n\nBut while the nominations for the 64th annual Grammy Awards certainly validated the Recording Academy’s revived commitment to diversity, some familiar names – and frequent visitors to the Grammy podium – were either shunned or relegated to smaller genre categories.\n\nBillie Eilish, Doja Cat, H.E.R. and Olivia Rodrigo are among the top nominees this year, while jazz-R&B musician Jon Batiste scored a leading 11 nominations.\n\nBut popular chart-toppers including Drake, Miley Cyrus and BTS didn't get much love.\n\n“The thing that keeps me up at night is that we don’t get a chance to honor all of the amazing projects produced every year,” Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason Jr. tells USA TODAY. “I come from the music sphere and know the feeling of putting your heart and soul into a project, hoping to get recognized.

The release not only brims with Cyrus’ passion for the era but singles “Prisoner” (with Dua Lipa) and “Angels Like You” (featuring a co-write with Ryan Tedder) exemplify her ability to marry authenticity with rock charm.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\nHis fifth studio album, \"Tickets to My Downfall,\" established Kelly as a pop-punkster who formally ditched his hip-hop roots. Still, his slick, guitar-fronted anthems didn't warrant a single nod. But between his ongoing musical partnership with Blink-182's Travis Barker and a hit rock single with \"Papercuts,\" from his upcoming \"Born with Horns\" album, MGK should have a reason for future Grammy consideration.\n\nDrake\n\nPrepare for another round of Drake vs. Kanye. The latter scored an album of the year nod for his much-tinkered with “Donda.” But Drake, despite breaking Spotify records, becoming the eighth artist in Billboard history to earn 10 No. 1 albums with “Certified Lover Boy” and outselling Ye with first-week sales, was only recognized for best rap album and best rap performance (“Way 2 Sexy” with Future and Young Thug). The Weeknd would like a word.\n\nBTS\n\nWe’ll acknowledge that “Butter” isn’t as hearty a slice of pop perfection as its predecessor, “Dynamite.” But it’s still a blissfully fun contribution from the K-pop superstars – not to mention the song of summer that broke a record on Spotify’s global chart for biggest song debut in the platform’s history. So only one nod for best pop duo/group performance? The BTS Army would like a word.\n\nMore awards: Brutally honest reviews of AMAs performances\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\nA nomination for best rap performance (“Thot S---”) is acceptable, but the most recent best new artist winner had every reason to expect that her debut album, “Good News,” would earn a few back slaps. The critically acclaimed release bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart, spawned the platinum singles “Body” and “Cry Baby” (with DaBaby) and pushed Megan further into the conversation of notable current female rappers.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nThe double Grammy-winner released “Positions” to reasonable acclaim as she continued to push a sound that mingled pop with R&B and trap. Though the album leaned more heavily on breathy ballads of seduction rather than club thumpers, it still earned her a No. 1 single with the title track, which landed a Grammy nod for best pop solo performance. The album will also compete for best pop vocal album, but there was an assumption it would warrant a bigger Grammy spotlight.\n\nLorde\n\n“Solar Power” is among the works that earned Jack Antonoff his producer of the year nomination, but as for the artist herself? MIA this year. While “Solar Power” wasn’t as adored as her 2013 debut “Pure Heroine” or 2017’s “Melodrama,” it signified a stylistic shift that usually appeals to the Grammy crew. Lorde has called “Solar Power” her “weed album” due to the songs being steeped in hazy psychedelic pop and sparser instrumentation than her past work. Apparently, voters preferred her in the clubs.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nAs we know from her “Miss Americana” documentary, the album of the year category is the one that Swift covets the most, so no doubt she’s pleased with “Evermore” landing among the year’s heavyweights. But whither “Willow,” which she performed as part of a medley at this year’s Grammy ceremony? Or “No Body, No Crime,” which returned Swift to her country radio roots? The omissions make Swift's album nod seem obligatory, which it certainly is not.\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nRecording Academy honcho Mason confirmed the embattled country singer was eligible to be nominated (“As long as the requirements meet our standards as far as date and genre, we don’t decide who is eligible,” Mason told USA TODAY). But despite the massive commercial success of “Dangerous: The Double Album,” and hit singles “Sand in My Boots,” “7 Summers” and “More Than My Hometown,” Grammy voters didn’t acknowledge Wallen, who was caught on camera uttering a racial slur in February.\n\nAlicia Keys, Kacey Musgraves, Lizzo\n\nOne year you’re a Grammy darling and the next cycle, a distant memory. Well, not completely. Keys, who has earned an impressive 15 Grammys (amid 29 nominations), popped up only in the best immersive audio album category (recordings released on formats such as DVD-Audio, Atmos and Blu-Ray) for “Alicia” and shares a record of the year nod not for her solo work, but “A Beautiful Noise,” which she performed with Brandi Carlile on “Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy” (it’s also on the digital version of “Alicia”).\n\nMeanwhile, former album of the year winner Musgraves, whose “Golden Hour” garnered an armload of trophies at the 2019 ceremony between the general and country categories, only nabbed a bit of recognition for “Camera Roll” (best country song and best country solo performance), from her current album (aka \"the divorce one\"), “Star-Crossed.”\n\nAs for Lizzo, she’s just a year removed from scoring her first three career Grammys, but her 2021 single with Cardi B, “Rumors,” didn’t merit any attention.\n\nGrammys 2022 surprises\n\nJon Batiste\n\nFaithful viewers of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” are well-aware of Batiste’s nimble musicianship with his band, Stay Human. But even with the jazz/R&B trailblazer’s sterling resume, his 11 nominations – the most among any artist this year – his isn’t a name expected among the album of the year (“We Are”) and record of the year (“Freedom”) lineups. It’s been a celebratory period for Batiste, who snagged an Academy Award in 2021 for best original score for “Soul.” Despite three previous Grammy nominations, he has yet to win. But with his current multiple nominations spread across jazz, R&B, American roots and classical categories, that will likely change in January.\n\nABBA\n\nWe’re the first to agree that ABBA’s absence among Grammy winners is blasphemous. But we’re also rational enough to realize that while their ’70s and ’80s output – “Mamma Mia,” “Waterloo,” “Dancing Queen” “The Winner Takes It All” – was undoubtedly deserving of awards praise, the single “I Still Have Faith In You,” from the group’s first album (“Voyage”) in 40-plus years, is an odd inclusion for record of the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/05/24/summer-concerts-phoenix-harry-styles-lil-tjay-korn-celine-dion/5151095001/", "title": "Your guide to the biggest and best summer concerts as live music ...", "text": "It may not be the back-to-normal summer concert season we were hoping for in 2021, but after more than a year of no live music as the touring industry shut down for COVID-19, seeing even a handful of stars on the schedule at Ak-Chin Pavilion is kinda nice.\n\nThis is the summer concert season as it stands for now.

Kill! Kill!,” these glam-metal veterans hit the mainstream with the 1989 release of “Wake Me When It’s Over,” which contained their breakthrough single, “House of Pain.” The only holdout from that era in the current lineup is lead singer Taime Downe, but he sounded as sleazy as ever while adding a darker industrial edge to their sound on “The Power and the Glory Hole,” their only studio release so far this century.\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 5.

The show includes material from across the catalog, including many songs from \"In the Court of the Crimson King,\" a seminal 1969 release that's been hailed by the Who's Pete Townshend as an “uncanny masterpiece.” The seven-piece line-up, which includes guitarist Robert Fripp and bassist Tony Levin, will play songs King Crimson never previously played live, as well as new arrangements of Crimson classics.

Their biggest hits include a double-platinum breakthrough single, \"Dear Maria, Count Me In,\" \"Weightless,\" \"Damned If I Do Ya (Damned If I Don't),\" \"A Love Like War\" and \"Monsters.\" They're touring in support of last year's \"Wake Up, Sunshine.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 8.

He arrives in support of \"The Life of Pi'erre 5,\" his second major-label effort as an artist in his own right. Pitchfork hailed the album as a marked improvement for an act whose skills as a producer tend to overshadow his own rapping. On this latest album, Pitchfork notes, \"His voice meets the production halfway, becoming more than just another detail in an audio mosaic.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Aug. 9.

Billboard writes, \"Grupo Firme is not your typical banda artist.\" They're from Tijuana, not Mazatlán or Culiacán. And they have seven members. Banda ensembles typically have 16, norteño bands five. \"They are somewhere in the middle,\" Billboard writes. \"And it was their fresh take on regional Mexican classics that helped put them on the map.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Aug. 13.

When Rebelution topped the Billboard reggae charts with “Free Rein\" in 2018, they passed Matisyahu to secure their spot behind Bob Marley with the second-most appearances at No. 1 on that chart. And they grooved their way to No. 1 again a year later with \"Rebelution Vinyl Box Set.\"\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 18. Arizona Federal Theatre, 400 W.

Los Lobos may be best remembered in the mainstream as the guys who did the soundtrack to \"La Bamba.\" But those Ritchie Valens covers barely scratch the surface of their artistry.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Aug. 20.

He sets the tone by channeling the grandeur of Roy Orbison and Arcade Fire's \"Funeral\" in an opening track that builds to a crescendo with an overwrought delivery of \"Tell me the story of lonely/ I'll show you the pain of getting clean.\" Then he turns around and hits you with the Tom Waits-worthy gypsy-punk of \"Quiet as a Rat,\" in which the body of a girl who overdoses is discovered in the photo booth at last call. \"The pictures all showed her terrified and a loner,\" he sings, \"while everyone cried, 'What a good friend she was.'\" And nearly every song that follows has moments as striking as that.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 21.

And I’m pretty sure the Flaming Lips would be the only entertainers in that certain breed. There's nothing quite like a Flaming Lips concert, thanks in large part to the beyond-bizarre, enigmatic magnetism of the great Wayne Coyne. And last year's \"American Head\" is among the greatest psychedelic headphone records of the century.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Aug. 23. Marquee Theatre, 730 N.

The tour takes its name from a song the country singer wrote a few months back with friends. As Bentley sees it, \"It’s a pretty simple recipe for summer. Get your friends together, have a round or two and dive into some great country music.

The group's original lead singer, Peter Noone, is sure to dust off those two crowd-pleasers as well as hits as timeless as \"I'm Into Something Good,\" \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\" and \"There's a Kind of Hush.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Aug. 27.

They arrive in continued support of \"The Only Ones,\" a mini-album that did nothing to slow down the Everly Brothers comparisons as they made their way through such obvious highlights as the bittersweet title track about faking it \"like we aren't the only ones\" and \"My Name is Ana,\" the ballad of a girl who lives in the attic with her family.

What were they like? How have they shaped our country? Why does our presidential pick matter? Those are all questions that The Washington Post's Leadership editor, Lillian Cunningham, aims to answer on her podcast, Presidential. As of this weekend, she has published podcasts on all 43 presidents. (Yep, even William Henry Harrison, who only spent 32 days in the office before he died.) After the Barack Obama episode, Cunningham has one more show.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/02/gay-voters-trump-share-reasons-support-election/6116276002/", "title": "Gay voters for Trump share reasons for support this election", "text": "Kate Sosin\n\nThe 19th\n\nThis story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\n\nHis first bullies arrived by bike, middle-schoolers.\n\nThey called him a fairy, and other slurs. They smashed eggs on his head.\n\nThe taunts came day after day as he walked to and from school. His mother, fearing for her son, put him in a new school. He entered seventh grade with new classmates, but it didn’t get easier. This was Utah in the ‘90s.\n\nFrom the time he was little, he loved Barbies and Disney princesses. In kindergarten, he chose dresses when playing dress-up.\n\n“When I was like 8, and nobody was home, I would go in the closet and get the poofy part of my sister’s prom dress and just twirl around by myself and in the mirror,” he recalls. “And I definitely identified with what a culture calls female. And the great injustice for me, as someone who identifies with the feminine, is that this world says, a dress and makeup and sparkles are only for women.”\n\nMormon-raised in a house that did not support homosexuality, he desperately tried to suppress his attraction to boys. He went to Brigham Young University and served on a mission for two years in France. Still struggling after college, he put himself through anti-gay conversion therapy where he was promised a “normal” life. He started dating a best friend, a girl.\n\n“Her father actually left her family because he’s gay,” he said. “And I watched that devastation. And I was like, I’m not doing that, … She deserves a man who loves her, sexually and emotionally and physically and romantically, and I can’t do that.”\n\nHe took his chances. At age 22, he came out.\n\nMore than a decade later, Lady Maga USA makes her entrance into a throng clad in red T-shirts and hats.\n\n“Trump is making America great again, whether you’re Black, White, Latino or a drag queen!” she says to the crowd in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nThe drag queen bit is not a joke. That’s actually Miss Maga herself. It’s been years since that closeted young Mormon from Utah broke up with his girlfriend and came out. Today, he’s a mini-celebrity among die-hard Trump supporters.\n\nMiss Maga is wearing a “Make America Great Again” shirt and hat, looking out across a crowd of thousands chanting “USA! USA!” She wears white a “Lady Maga USA” sash across her chest. Her lips, like her shirt, are bright red. Her curls are perfectly curled and blonde.\n\nThis outfit, like all of her outfits, is strictly G-rated. When she first appeared as Lady Maga USA (always add the USA, lest Lady Gaga’s people get litigious), it was in an American flag bikini. Now, she aims to be a family-friendly drag queen, typically sporting jeans or a ball gown.\n\nMiss Maga, who chooses to go by her stage name – she said she and her mother have received death threats because she supports Trump – used to be a Democrat. In the early 2000s, she met Al and Tipper Gore at a Human Rights Campaign dinner.\n\nBack then, Republicans just weren’t accepting, she said. Even still, she voted for George W. Bush in 2004. She felt like the left was growing intolerable and unforgiving, unwilling to engage in difficult conversations.\n\nFor three years, her drag persona had been Ryanna Woods, a nod to the character Elle Woods from the film “Legally Blonde.” In 2019, she debuted Lady Maga USA. Friends she had for years through Utah’s drag bars stopped talking to her.\n\n“As soon as I came out as a Trump supporter, for them it erased all the good qualities that I have, and they only focused on that, assuming that I’m some sort of monster,” she said. “I lost everything. I lost my performances. I lost my friends. I lost my sense of community.”\n\nHer new community is made up of thousands of other LGBTQ people who back president Trump, she says. She almost always appears at rallies as Lady Maga USA, and this October she was fully booked. Her schedule had no less than eight Trump events – all unpaid – leading up to Election Day.\n\nMiss Maga has drained her own finances on costumes, travel and hotels to show her support for the president.\n\nMiss Maga’s top issues are not LGBTQ rights. She is a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and for free speech. She thinks that people have a right to say offensive things, even if they are hateful.\n\n“I think that the LGBT mainstream community is pushing further and further trying to eliminate all discussion or questioning of their agenda,” she said. “And I think that’s dangerous because we could be next. Anyone can be next, and I believe that free speech is absolute.”\n\nAt the Albuquerque Trump rally, she gives hugs to fellow supporters. She speaks in Spanish and English. She stops for photos.\n\n“God bless you,” a man says to her.\n\nThis is not the response she expected the first time she went to a Trump rally in drag last year.\n\n“I was terrified to go to the Trump rally, because I thought I may be rejected, I may be yelled at, I may be kicked out for all I know,” Miss Maga told The 19th. “But the moment I arrived, the first thing that happened was a lady comes running up to me and asked for a picture and told me I was fabulous. And then I walked in my full drag into the rally past the line and people were just cheering and screaming and welcoming me.”\n\nEmbraced by conservatives\n\nMiss Maga is among a rarely discussed voting bloc: LGBTQ Republicans. According to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, just 15% of LGBTQ people are Republicans, compared with 35% of the general population. It’s unclear what percentage of those Republicans will vote for Trump in this election. Before taking office, Trump vowed to be a friend to LGBTQ people. Many say he broke that promise.\n\nLGBTQ media organization GLAAD has tallied at least 175 incidents of the Trump administration attacking the community, from substantial policy rollbacks to the transgender military ban to fighting against landmark LGBTQ workplace protections won at the Supreme Court in June. Jennifer Pritzker, transgender billionaire, backed Trump four years ago. This time around, she has funneled more than $100,000 into defeating him.\n\nConservative values have often been painted as antithetical to LGBTQ rights. But the people who encapsulate both of those groups present a different picture.\n\nChad Felix Greene describes a similar experience of being embraced by conservatives as an openly gay person. Greene grew up in West Virginia and Ohio, with no openly gay peers in school.\n\nAs he entered his teenage years, he wished desperately he could be a girl. He tried wearing women’s clothing, but none of it looked right on him.\n\n“I felt a sense of despair that there did not seem to be an option for me,” he said.\n\nIn 1998, the same year as the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado, Greene’s principal outed him to his parents in front of school counselors, he said. His father, who had only seen depictions of gay people because of the AIDS epidemic, was traumatized by the event, Greene said. He was the first person in his high school to come out, and it made him a target of bullying. Adults in his life worried that like the Columbine shooters, Greene was an outcast.\n\n“I had to go to a therapist and had to have a written statement that I was mentally fit, and I wasn’t dangerous to anybody,” he recalled.\n\nHe remembers sitting in high school science class one day next to a friend he’d had since kindergarten. Her eyes, crystal blue, reminded him so much of Ellen Degeneres’, which he’d seen on the cover of a book. He told her she had Ellen’s eyes.\n\n“And (I) remember that she instantaneously said, ‘Don’t ever compare me to that woman,’” Greene recalled.\n\nThe experience struck him so much that he drew into himself. Comparing anyone to a gay person was unforgivable – he was unforgivable. “I almost didn’t graduate,” he said. “I ended up graduating, I think second to last in my class. I just barely got by because I didn’t care any longer.”\n\nIn college, he took sociology and psychology classes, and the world started to open up. He became what he called an “aggressive liberal activist,” making pamphlets about gay rights that he left on cars and at churches.\n\nBut Greene found his liberal peers dismissive and unforgiving, he said. His first girlfriend in middle school, whom he always idealized, had been Black. He remembers sharing with a college class that when he had a kid, he wanted to adopt a Black child.\n\n“Several of the Black girls in the class told me that was the same as slavery,” he said. “They thought that I was purchasing a Black woman to be a symbol of pride for myself and that it was racism, and it was so startling to me to be called a racist.”\n\nIt was one of several incidents that pushed Greene away from progressive circles and toward conservative politics, he said. But it wasn’t until 2018 that he voted Republican, or voted at all. The confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh pushed him over the edge. Greene did not believe allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh or concerns from LGBTQ advocacy groups that he posed a threat to equal rights.\n\n“I thought he was brutally targeted by an intentional campaign to smear him as aggressively as possible with false allegations to try and thwart his nomination,” Greene said. “I’m a survivor of rape. What they did hurt me very personally.”\n\nToday, Greene’s a prominent LGBTQ conservative voice. He has more than 45,000 Twitter followers and a new book out, “Without Context: Evaluating the Anti-LGBT Claims Against the Trump Administration.” He early voted in Ohio this year, his first presidential election.\n\nIdeas over identity\n\nLike Greene, Wyatt Torosian takes issue with identity politics. Torosian, a bisexual and mixed-raced conservative, says he cares less about a person’s race or gender and more about their ideas.\n\n“There has been an overemphasis on personal background and people’s identifiers as determining what their beliefs could be,” he said.\n\nTorosian lives in Hollywood, a beacon of LGBTQ acceptance. His best friend is a “cis Jewish liberal socialist female,” he says. He grew up in what he describes as an apolitical family in Fresno, California. He came out as conservative in high school, long before he came out as bisexual, which was just four years ago. It’s hard to say which was more difficult, he said.\n\nTorosian believes in limited government and strong national defense. Social issues are low on his list. He concedes that it might be a privilege to look at this election and not see the outcome as life or death for him or the people that he loves, but he also thinks that people overstate that worry to bully people into voting with them.\n\n“If you’re on dialysis, and your health care coverage protects that, and then the next occupant [of the White House] might alter that health care coverage that could be a life or death situation, that is the person I want to hear from,” he said.\n\nLGBTQ conservatives interviewed tend to value the same things as as other conservatives: They believe in small government, have an “America-first” mindset, and are anti-abortion. They see Trump’s rollback of LGBTQ rights as part of a larger deregulation campaign to limit the powers of the federal government, not as a targeted attack on gay and transgender rights.\n\nStraight Republicans have welcomed LGBTQ people, they say. New data from the Human Rights Campaign suggests that Trump voters in swing states largely support LGBTQ equality. In Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, Trump voters were more likely than not to support marriage equality, adoption rights and transgender military service. At least 60% in each state said trans people should be able to live freely and openly, and 87% or more backed trans access to medical care.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t translate to support for transgender rights across the board. In fact, many gay, lesbian and bisexual conservatives openly question the validity of transgender people. Miss Maga and Greene believe transgender people will forever be “biologically” the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\n“I’m not going to tell a person who is transgender that they are not who they feel they are,” Greene said. “But I also don’t think that I’m obligated to believe them, or agree with them based on just what they tell me, either.”\n\nGreene cites his own teenage desires to be a girl as proof that it’s possible for people to outgrow gender dysphoria. He desperately wanted to be female, but he’s perfectly happy presenting as male now – though his gender is complicated, he says.\n\n“I feel like it’s similar to somebody who believes they’re psychic,” he said. “From an objective point of view, I can’t say that they aren’t, but I also can’t believe that they are. I feel the same way that if you are biologically male, you’re a physical male, and you say ‘I feel like I am female,’ what you’re doing is you are imagining what that must be like based on what you know, a female is.”\n\nMiss Maga, too, always longed to put on dresses and sparkle, like a Disney princess. But she’s very clear that when the dress comes off, so does the lady. She wants people to use male pronouns when she’s out of drag.\n\nTorosian differs here. While he says there is a difference between gender identity and sexual orientation, he sees trans issues as inherently connected to lesbian, gay and bisexual issues.\n\n“I don’t get into the conversation where people want to get into the semantics of what trans is and everything like that,” he said. “I think that it’s a personal experience for each individual.”\n\nLike many conservatives, Torosian, Greene and Miss Maga oppose gender-affirming health care for transgender children.\n\nTransgender children who experience gender dysphoria can be prescribed puberty blockers, temporary injections that pause puberty until a young person is old enough to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to medically transition.\n\nThe American Medical Association states that the importance of puberty blockers “cannot be overstated,” adding that once kids start development of the “ ‘wrong’ sex,” their psychological well being substantially deteriorates and they are at risk for suicide. A Harvard Medical School study this year found that puberty blockers lowered suicide risk in transgender children by 15 percent.\n\nBut many LGBTQ conservatives think that kids are too young to socially transition, and they discount consensus among major medical organizations that state puberty blockers are reversible, safe and necessary, favoring controversial, often debunked studies.\n\nBut for Miss Maga, the argument is simple. She feels like she grew up a lot like Elsa, heroine of Disney’s “Frozen,” who is forced to wear gloves because she can’t control her ability to turn everything into ice with a wave of her hand.\n\n“That’s how I felt as an Eagle Scout,” Miss Maga said. Playing into masculinity felt like keeping gloves on, keeping some magical power hidden, she said.\n\nWhen “Frozen” came out in 2013, Miss Maga realized that boys could be sparkly and beautiful. Boys could wear dresses and heels. A person doesn’t need to transition to do that, she feels. To her that feels like gender essentialism. Lost in this discussion is the difference between gender identity, who you are at the core, and gender expression — some of us wear pants and some of us wear skirts.\n\n“What makes me different, is actually beautiful,” she said. “It’s actually amazing, and I have something to offer the world. Watch me build a castle. Watch me sparkle.”\n\nAnd now, thousands of people do.

They claim the social media site suppressed information about Hunter Biden’s laptop and censored GOP views on the platform. Twitter employees have been invited to testify.\n\n— Candy Woodall\n\nIn case you missed it:McCarthy plans to block Democrats Swalwell, Schiff from House Intelligence Committee\n\nBiden calls for ‘peaceful protests’ before release of body camera footage in Tyre Nichols case\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the family of Tyre Nichols deserves a “swift, full and fair investigation” into his death and called for “peaceful protests” after five former Memphis police officers were charged Thursday with second-degree murder.\n\n“Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable,” Biden said in his first statement on the Nichols case. “Violence is destructive and against the law. It has no place in peaceful protests seeking justice.”\n\nNichols, 29, died Jan. 7 after a police traffic stop that resulted in “two confrontations with police,” according to Memphis police. Nichols \"complained of a shortness of breath,” police said. Video from police-worn body cameras of the interaction is scheduled for release Friday evening. Nichols was black. The five officers charged in the case are also Black.\n\n“We cannot ignore the fact that fatal encounters with law enforcement have disparately impacted Black and Brown people,” Biden said, renewing his call for policing reform legislation that stalled in Congress last year.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nMemphis police incident:'This was criminal': Former Memphis police officers arrested, face murder charges in Tyre Nichols' death\n\nCalifornia will seek to disbar Trump lawyer John Eastman\n\nCalifornia’s state bar is seeking to revoke the law license of John Eastman, the lawyer who spearheaded an effort to use slates of fake electors in battleground states to overturn the 2020 election in favor of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe state bar alleges that Eastman violated his duty to uphold the U.S. and California state constitutions in an attempt to “usurp the will of the American people and overturn election results for the highest office in the land.”\n\n“There is nothing more sacrosanct to our American democracy than free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power,” George Cardona, chief trial counsel to California’s state bar, said in a statement. “...(Eastman) must be held accountable.”\n\nEastman holds law licenses in both Washington, D.C. and California.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nTrump allies:State election officials tell Jan. 6 committee of pressure, threats from Trump and allies\n\nBiden: Republicans are ‘threatening to destroy’ economy over debt ceiling\n\nPresident Joe Biden accused Republicans Thursday of \"threatening to destroy\" the economy over brinkmanship on the debt limit and proposed GOP cuts to domestic programs.\n\n“They seem determined to be the party of chaos and catastrophe,” Biden, speaking from a steamfitters union hall in Springfield, Virginia, said after the release of a new report on the gross domestic product that showed better-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nHouse Republicans have not released a unified economic plan. The Republican Study Committee, which includes about 160 Republicans, last year endorsed raising the retirement age to 70 to qualify for Social Security benefits. Still, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has insisted Republicans have no plans to cut Social Security and Medicare, even as Biden warns the two programs could be slashed if Republicans get their way.\n\nFinancial markets are on edge that a failure to raise the debt limit would lead to the nation's first-ever default, a scenario that economists fear could plunge the economy into a recession. Biden has said he won't negotiate with Republicans seeking to use the debt ceiling to achieve unspecified spending cuts.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nElaine Chao addresses Donald Trump's racist comments about her\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao chided her one-time boss – former President Donald Trump – this week, speaking out about him repeatedly making racist comments about her.\n\nTrump on Truth Social on Monday targeted Chao with a racial charged nickname and her husband, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as he attempting to link them to the classified documents found in a Washington, D.C. office that has been used by President Joe Biden. Chao responded by slamming the former president for the slurs he has repeatedly used against her.\n\n“When I was young, some people deliberately misspelled or mispronounced my name,” Chao, an Asian-American who served as transportation secretary in Trump’s administration, said in a statement to USA TODAY. “Asian Americans have worked hard to change that experience for the next generation. He doesn’t seem to understand that, which says a whole lot more about him than it will ever say about Asian Americans.”\n\n- Marina Pitofsky\n\nMore:'Says a whole lot more about him': Elaine Chao speaks out about Donald Trump's racist comments on her\n\nNational Archives asks former presidents, VPs to recheck their offices for classified material\n\nThe National Archives has sent a letter to representatives of former presidents and vice presidents dating back to the Reagan administration asking them to examine whether they have classified information in their possession, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe request was apparently prompted by investigations involving former President Donald Trump, current President Joe Biden, and former vice president Mike Pence and their handling of classified material.\n\nOther recipients of the National Archives request include the offices of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan, and former vice presidents Dick Cheney, Al Gore, and Dan Quayle.\n\nAn official with one of the recipient offices confirmed the letter, but would not discuss it. The offices of Obama, Bush, and Clinton have said they have no classified material in their possession.\n\nCNN, which first reported the letter, said former presidents and vice-presidents are being asked to \"re-check their personal records for any classified documents or other presidential records in the wake of classified documents discovered in the homes of\" Trump, Pence, and Biden.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNational Archives letter to ex-presidents:National Archives asks ex-presidents and vice presidents to look for classified documents\n\nRecords request:After Trump, Biden, Pence, are other former presidents holding classified documents?

What is it?\n\nThe House is voting on legislation Thursday that would limit President Joe Biden's authority to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after Republicans claim he misused the power for political gains.\n\nThe bill, labeled the Strategic Petroleum Response Act (H.R. 21), would prevent an administration from withdrawing oil from the reserves unless there is an increase in the percentage of federal lands that produce oil and gas to match the percentage withdrawn.\n\nThe bill is unlikely to become law; it does not have the votes to pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the Biden administration has said it would veto it in any case. It comes after Biden ordered the largest withdrawal in U.S. history last year, a move that plummeted the reserves' levels to their lowest since 1984.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMore on this bill:In House vote on Strategic Production Response Act, GOP aims to limit oil reserve withdrawal\n\nFBI dismantles website of notorious ransomware gang Hive\n\nFederal authorities dismantled a website operated by a notorious ransomware gang, known to extort millions of dollars from victims as part of a global cybercrime operation.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the FBI late Wednesday seized a cache of computer servers in Los Angeles supporting the group known as Hive, while foreign law enforcement partners took control of a similar network in Europe to take down the operation which had targeted 1,500 victims in 80 countries.\n\nSince June 2021, federal authorities said, Hive had reaped more than $100 million in ransom payments from schools, hospitals and a range of private companies.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nRead more on the FBI operation:FBI dismantles ransomware gang Hive's website. $130 million in ransom payments averted.\n\nAdam Schiff announces bid for California Senate seat\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., announced Thursday he is launching a campaign to run for Senate.\n\nSchiff, who has served in the House since 2001, was a member of the House Intelligence Committee in the last Congress and was a key figure during the Jan. 6 hearings to investigate the attack on the Capitol. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blocked Schiff this week from serving on the Intelligence Committee in the 118th Congress.\n\nSchiff will be the second candidate vying for the Senate seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has not announced whether she will seek reelection or retire. California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter announced earlier this month she is also vying for the seat.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nPaul Pelosi attack video to be released\n\nOver the objections of prosecutors, a judge has ruled that the footage of the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband can be released. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stephen M. Murphy ruled there was no reason to keep the footage secret, especially after prosecutors played it in open court during a preliminary hearing last month.\n\nPaul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's husband, was asleep at the couple's San Francisco home on Oct. 28 when someone broke in and beat him with a hammer. Prosecutors have charged 42-year-old David DePape in connection with the attack.\n\nDePape pleaded not guilty last month to six charges, including attempted murder. Police have said DePape told them there was \"evil in Washington\" and he wanted to harm Nancy Pelosi because she was second in line to the presidency. His case is pending.\n\n- The Associated Press\n\nHow the Paul Pelosi attack unfolded:A break-in, a conversation, a 911 call, then violence\n\nThe battle to lead the RNC\n\nAll three contenders to lead the Republican National Committee are supporters of former President Donald Trump but are arguing about candidate recruitment and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nRNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, seeking a fourth term, faces opposition from California attorney Harmeet Dhillon and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell. McDaniel is favored to win, but opponents are roaming the halls of a beach resort in Dana Point, Calif., seeking support.\n\n\"We will decide if we're serious about winning in 2024,\" Dhillon tweeted this week.

His afternoon remarks will follow the release of fourth-quarter 2022 gross domestic product figures. The White House has warned of catastrophe if House Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nFailure to act would lead to the nation's first-ever default on its debt. Biden has said that would lead to a “calamity that exceeds anything that’s ever never happened in the history of the United States.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nMeta to lift bans on Trump Facebook, Instagram accounts\n\nMeta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, will reinstate former President Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the upcoming weeks as Trump prepares another presidential run, ending the two-year suspension.\n\nThe company indefinitely banned Trump's accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack to reduce the risk of violence as Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, accused Trump of trying \"to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.\"\n\nTrump responded to the ban being lifted on Truth Social: \"Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!\"\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nCountdown to 2024: Porter, Gallego launch bids for Senate seats\n\nDemocrats currently have a narrow majority in the upper chamber but that will be tested next year.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nGoogle+ finally ceased operations in April after eight years of efforts to boost interest in the struggling social network. The long-anticipated shutdown represents just the latest major Google product to fail to live up to its promise.\n\nGoogle has gained notoriety for scuttling dozens of projects, but just like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take on big risks, hoping for success but not always finding it.\n\nThese failures can take many different forms. Often, a product simply does not connect with consumers and does not sell. In other cases, it may not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, or it is recalled or discontinued for some flaws. These can all be marked as failures. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nThe real cost of cutting the cord:What streaming companies don’t want you to know\n\nDollar store games:Bargain shopping for video games, gaming accessories can pay off at dollar stores\n\nSometimes, it can take years or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax, a video format that Sony introduced with the expectation it would replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\nSome of the products on this list were among the most highly anticipated products of the year, and when released, they were the biggest product launches of the year – that is, before failing.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\n1. Google Glass\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass – an eyeglasses-shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities – to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you – to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1993\n\n• What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\n• Company: Atari\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\" The video game was developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development – games typically take months, if not years, to program – the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\n• Company: Burger King\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\n• Company: RJ Reynolds\n\n• Year introduced: 1988\n\n• What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes – the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 2005\n\n• What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\n• Company: Fox\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\n• Company: Clairol\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol – at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb – thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\n9. New Coke\n\n• Company: Coca-Cola\n\n• Year introduced: 1985\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years – but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2007\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not – in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\n• Company: Colgate\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\n• Company: Coors\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley-Davidson perfume\n\n• Company: Harley-Davidson\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley-Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the more masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this fact, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\n• Holding company: Unilever\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\n• Company: Cosmopolitan\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\n• Company: De Havilland\n\n• Year introduced: 1949\n\n• What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\n• Company: Delorean Motor Company\n\n• Year introduced: 1981\n\n• What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\n• Company: Heinz\n\n• Year released: 2000\n\n• Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were – and still are – among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\n• Company: USFL\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\n• Company: Facebook\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\n• Company: Ford\n\n• Year introduced: 1957\n\n• What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel – named after Henry Ford’s son – ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\n• Company: Friendster\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop – as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year – the most of any new product in 1998 – sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\n24. Zune\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment – a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\n• Company: GlaxoSmithKline\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic – Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such was the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. In April 2019 Google+ was shut down for good.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\n• Company: Hewlett-Packard\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\n• Company: Kellogg's\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal to busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\n• Company: Maxwell House\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\n• Company: McDonald's\n\n• Year introduced: 1996\n\n• What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\n31. HD DVD\n\n• Company: Toshiba\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\n• Company: Universal Pictures\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\n• Company: Netflix\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill-conceived strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\n• Company: Nintendo\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\n• Company: Nokia/Intel\n\n• Year introduced: 2010\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\n• Company: Pepsi\n\n• Year introduced: 1992\n\n• What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\n• Company: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\n• Year released: 1999\n\n• What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\n• Company: Phillips\n\n• Year introduced: 1978\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows – an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\n• Company: Sega\n\n• Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n• What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time – it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility – but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\n• Company: Smith & Wesson\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1983\n\n• What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\n• Company: Sony\n\n• Year introduced: 1975\n\n• What it was: Videocassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard videocassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\n• Company: Silicon Knights\n\n• Year introduced: 2008\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectations and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\n• Company: ESPN\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\n• Company: Life Savers\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint-flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\n• Company: Walt Disney Motion\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\n• Company: Eons.com\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com – a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\n• Company: NBC\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\n• Company: Samsung\n\n• Year introduced: 2016\n\n• What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well-received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a Southwest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nPrice, timing can cause product failings\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another – rightly so or not – they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty – at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary. Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.\n\nCorporate reputations:Wegmans, Amazon have best ones, but which companies have the worst?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe all eat them — ultraprocessed foods such as frozen pizza and ready-to-eat meals make our busy lives much easier. Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nIn fact, men and women who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 28% faster rate of global cognitive decline and a 25% faster rate of executive function decline compared with people who ate the least amount of overly processed food, the study found.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not a lot of calories\n\nThe study, presented Monday at the 2022 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in San Diego, followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency were performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” said coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\n“People who consumed more than 20% of daily calories from processed foods had a 28% faster decline in global cognition and a 25% faster decline in executive functioning compared to people who ate less than 20%,” said study coauthor Natalia Gonçalves, a researcher in the department of pathology at the University of São Paulo Medical School.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“People need to know they should cook more and prepare their own food from scratch. I know. We say we don’t have time but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease,” she added. “That’s the take-home message: Stop buying things that are superprocessed.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/29/senate-passes-changes-iowa-bottle-bill-grocery-stores-opt-out-mobile-redemption-can-collection/7196959001/", "title": "Iowa bottle bill changes advance in Senate, would let stores opt out", "text": "Iowa lawmakers are more determined than ever to overhaul the state's decades-old bottle and can redemption program — but don't crack open a celebratory beverage just yet.\n\nSenate lawmakers passed their proposal, Senate File 2378, Tuesday on a 31-18 vote. Every Republican voted yes except Sen. Mark Lofgren, R-Muscatine, who joined Democrats in voting no. It was the first time in years that the issue has been debated by a full chamber of the Legislature.\n\nLawmakers have been repeatedly stymied when attempting to update the law, which allows Iowans to return empty cans and bottles to grocery stores and other retailers to get back a 5-cent deposit that they paid when buying the drink. Some have tried to scrap the program, and others have argued for expanding it, saying it encourages people to recycle their containers rather than throwing them away.\n\nHouse Republicans have their own plan this year — with key differences from the Senate version — and it's not clear the two chambers will be able to reach an agreement this year since the end of the legislative session is potentially just a few weeks away.\n\nKick the can:Iowa's bottle bill was falling apart — and then the pandemic made things worse\n\nThe House had been scheduled to debate its own bill, House File 2571, Tuesday afternoon, but pulled it from the calendar following the Senate vote.\n\n\"We’re letting some negotiations play out before determining our next step,\" Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, one of the authors of the House bill, said in a statement Tuesday. \"We remain hopeful that we will be able to come together and reach an agreement on a good bill for Iowa.\"\n\nLast Thursday, Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, said during a taping of \"Iowa Press\" on Iowa PBS that \"I wouldn't predict this is the year yet.\"\n\n\"I do think momentum is building towards getting something finally done on that. I don't know that this is the year or not,\" Dawson said of the law. \"But I do think that post-pandemic a lot of Iowans are starting to take a look at how we recycle and maybe trying to find a way to refresh the old system.\"\n\nEven the bill's floor manager, Sen. Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig, acknowledged the legislation had made more progress than in past years.\n\n\"I didn’t fully expect to get to this point,\" he said.\n\nBut Democrats said the Senate's bill would in essence kill the decades-old law by giving Iowans fewer opportunities to return their bottles and cans.\n\n\"Iowans have been loud and clear,\" Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said in a statement. \"They have been frustrated with the loss of redemption centers and the refusal of some retailers to accept containers. This bill takes us in the wrong direction and would mean the death of the bottle bill.\"\n\nWhat would the House and Senate bottle bill plans do?\n\nOne of lawmakers' central aims is to prop up Iowa's redemption centers, which have struggled to make ends meet under the current system. Many centers have gone out of business over the years.\n\n\"Our redemption centers are starting to dwindle as the years have gone on there,\" Dawson said on Iowa Press. \"And if we're going to have a recycling program, particularly for rural Iowa, there has to be a robust redemption center system out there.\"\n\nThe House and Senate plans each would give more money to redemption centers than the centers receive under the current law. The House bill would increase the redemption centers' 1-cent handling fee to 2 cents, while the Senate would increase it to 3 cents.\n\nSchultz said boosting the handling fee to 3 cents would incentivize new or expanded redemption centers.\n\n\"I think if you triple the amount of money that goes into a certain sector, whether it’s cotton candy, a gun shop or a luxury car dealership, you’re going to get more of them,\" he said. \"It happens that way.\"\n\nBoth the House and Senate bills would allow ways for retailers like grocery stores and convenience stores to opt out of taking back empty bottles and cans. The Senate's version would allow stores to stop accepting containers beginning July 1, 2023.\n\nCurrent law requires them to accept the empty containers and return the 5-cent deposit paid by Iowans when they purchase pop or beer — but some stores have refused to take back the bottles and cans, in defiance of the law.\n\nLohse, who owns a local grocery store, called it \"a food safety issue\" for grocery stores to have to accept dirty containers, especially when stores serve fresh food.\n\n\"I will not get into — in public and online — the things that we have found in the cans and bottles that come into our store,\" Lohse said at a committee meeting last week.\n\nRep. Mary Wolfe, D-Clinton, was one of three Democrats to vote against the House proposal in the Ways and Means Committee last week. She said the bill seems to address grocery stores' flouting of the requirement that they accept empty containers by doing away with the requirement altogether.\n\n\"It seems like we are somewhat rewarding them for getting away with it for so long,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans like Dawson and Lohse have said they'd like to see mobile redemption centers where Iowans can return containers, scan a code and have money deposited in their accounts. The Senate bill contains language to set up those systems, which would be allowed to return Iowans' 5-cent deposit to them within 10 days rather than immediately.\n\nBut Senate Democrats said they don't believe those programs will end up being accessible for all Iowans.\n\n\"Those are expensive, and they’re only going to work in areas where you have a high volume of cans,\" Dotzler said. \"You’re not going to invest in a mobile unit and take it and put it in a rural Iowa area and expect that to be profitable, so I don’t see those as being the answer to this.\"\n\nSen. Tom Shipley, R-Nodaway, said his ears \"popped up\" when he heard that.\n\n\"I’m the smallest market area that you can imagine,\" he said, referring to Adams County in southwest Iowa. \"In my little county, they’re already looking at this system. They started looking at this system months ago.\"\n\nThe Senate's bill would also require proof of identification when someone returns more than 2,000 cans, to ensure people aren't crossing state lines to obtain the 5-cent deposit.\n\nAnd it would reduce the per-barrel beer excise tax from 5.89 cents to 4.3 cents, which is expected to reduce state revenues by about $4.3 million annually, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency. Senators did not give a reason for making the change.\n\nPolling shows the bottle bill is popular\n\nA February poll of Iowa's active registered voters conducted by Selzer & Co. and commissioned by Cleaner Iowa found the bottle bill remains popular in Iowa. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they believe the program has been good for Iowa, while 12% said they believe it has been bad for the state.\n\nThe poll found 86% of Iowa voters favor expanding the number of places bottles and cans can be returned, and 72% favor increasing the 1-cent handling fee for redemption centers and stores.\n\nThe poll also found 71% support expanding the law to cover plastic bottles for water and sports drinks, and 51% support increasing the 5-cent deposit to 10 cents. Neither option is being considered in the House and Senate proposals this year.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it has been so drained, so exhausted over time without legislative attention that expansion is not an option right now,\" Schultz said of the law. \"We do not have the infrastructure, we don’t have the redemption centers to handle an additional load.\"\n\nThe poll also found 62% of voters said all stores that sell containers covered by the law must accept customers' return of the containers, compared to 34% who said stores should not have to accept returns if they feel it would affect the food they sell.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/31/super-bowl-commercials-top-ten-trends/1870741/", "title": "Super Bowl ad trends: Sex, goofy guys, stars and cars", "text": "Bruce Horovitz, USA TODAY\n\nNine in 10 viewers are as interested in the commercials as the game\n\nTwo advertisers will air commercials that are two-minutes long\n\nCelebrities will show up in swarms in some spots\n\nMadison Avenue's 2013 Super Bowl efforts can be described in two words: eye candy.\n\nThat's not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThe commercials for Super Bowl 2013 are so overloaded with eye candy — sexy models, too-cute kids, wacky animals, magical happenings and effects — that by the time folks take them all in, many viewers will feel like they just swallowed the entire bag of Halloween candy in one sitting.\n\nNo room for the chips and dip.\n\nThat, of course, won't stop an estimated 111 million viewers from watching most of the 50-some TV spots from 30-some advertisers.\n\nA new survey by Nielsen confirms that: 91% of consumers say they are as interested in watching the commercials as the game itself. At roughly $3.8 million per 30-second spot, Super Bowl marketers are expected to easily top last year's record of $262.5 million, reports Kantar Media.\n\nAnd we will test them all on Sunday in the 25th Anniversary USA TODAY Ad Meter — a consumer rating of the game's ads — to see which ad tops them all.\n\nMeanwhile, here are the top 10 trends to track as you watch the ads:\n\n• Cars that empower. Maybe it's that new-car smell. Maybe it's the octane in the gasoline. Or maybe it's just Madison Avenue hyperbole on the ad world's biggest stage.\n\nThere's something about new cars in this year's Super Bowl commercials that seems to utterly embolden whoever is driving them — or even just sitting in them — to do things they never would otherwise.\n\nTake the Audi spot. A high school kid goes dateless to the prom. Even his little sister pokes fun at him. But then his dad hands him the keys to the Audi — the hot S6 performance model — and everything magically changes. He drives to prom and brazenly pulls into the school principal's parking spot. Once on the dance floor, he bravely kisses the prom queen — even with her boyfriend (prom king) watching. OK, it costs the kid a black eye, but, heck, he drives off in his Audi with prom queen in tow.\n\nIn a Hyundai spot, a kid is moved to strategically take on the neighborhood bully.\n\nThen, there's spunky VW. Its new commercial takes place in a dysfunctional office that has but a single, happy worker. Turns out the key to his happiness also is the key to his VW. Turns out that his happiness is contagious — so long as you sit with him in his VW.\n\n• Sex still sells. Sex never gets old on the Super Bowl.\n\nIt just gets weird.\n\nAdvertisers are fully aware that the single simplest way to snatch the attention of jaded male or female viewers is to show a sexy babe or dude. Or, in this year's oddest version, show a supermodel passionately kissing a computer geek.\n\nThat's what Go Daddy has in store, with Bar Refaeli, a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, puckering up with chunky, totally nerdy computer guy. The story line: Go Daddy's found the perfect match of brains and beauty.\n\nThe action gets even rougher in Kia's spot, featuring a former Miss USA, Alyssa Campanella, who plays a sexy robot who plasters a car-gawking dude — who leaves fingerprints on and kicks the tires of a new Forte — with a punch that sets him flying on his can.\n\nSpeed Stick gets into the act, too, with a guy at the laundromat who accidentally finds himself holding a cute stranger's yellow panties.\n\nBut the sexiest battle may be that of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit models. In one corner, there's Go Daddy's Refaeli. In the other, there's supermodel Kate Upton, appearing in the Mercedes-Benz commercial as a hopeful dude's dream date.\n\nMaybe next year, some savvy advertiser will coax Betty White into a bikini.\n\n• Ads with and by you. There was a time when Madison Avenue utterly ruled on Super Bowl Sunday. The nation's biggest and most powerful advertisers and advertising agencies used to publicly wrestle to display who could wow TV viewers by creating the one TV commercial that everyone would chat about the next morning at the water cooler.\n\nBut in a social-media age, not only is the water cooler empty, but so is the notion that consumers will idly sit by and watch whatever the advertising kingpins have to show them.\n\nThese days, many folks want to be hands-on. With an assist from the big agencies and advertisers, some people will create the ads that air Sunday — or, at the very least, choose to vote on which ads appear. This is a trend that Doritos began seven years ago with its \"Crash the Super Bowl\" platform that lets real people compete to create the ads that air based on online consumer voting. Once again, the chip brand has two consumer-created spots in Sunday's game.\n\nOthers, will have the chance to actually appear in — or even have their tweets included in — Super Bowl commercials. Lincoln is broadcasting a dramatization of tweets consumers submitted about their wackiest road trips. And Coca-Cola is urging fans to vote online to decide which of three commercial endings it uses in its ad. The ending to the Audi ad also was based on consumer input. And Pepsi asked people to send their photos for possible inclusion.\n\n• Celebrity swarms. It just wouldn't be a Super Bowl without a couple of dozen celebrities — from A- to C-list — parading in and out of the commercials.\n\nBut this go-round there's a twist: celebrity swarms. That's right, ads with celebs showing up in teams of three or more. The hope: Amid the crowd and frenzy of Super Bowl advertisers, the right celebrity might actually catch your attention.\n\nMercedes-Benz will flaunt three celebs: supermodel Kate Upton, singer Usher and actor Willem Dafoe.\n\nSubway, too, loads its Super Bowl spot with familiar celebrities and jocks, including spokesman Jared Vogel, superstar quarterback Robert Griffin III and nearly a dozen other athletes.\n\nSamsung's spot features comic actors Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Bob Odenkirk, all trying to figure what the next \"big thing\" is. It turns out, at least in this commercial, that the next big thing is someone who is arguably already a big thing: LeBron James. And, of course, James has a cameo in the ad.\n\n• Weird wildlife. There was a time when putting a puppy or cute kitty in a Super Bowl spot all but guaranteed instant payback. But Madison Avenue being Madison Avenue, well, it's rarely satisfied with what actually works.\n\nSo this Super Bowl, it seems, the domesticated, furry critters are increasingly being replaced by the undomesticated kind. Goodbye cats and dogs. Hello wolves, sabertoothed tigers, rhinos, cheetahs — and gazelles.\n\nA Skechers spot features a guy in a pair of Skechers who manages to outrun a cheetah in order to save the gazelle that the cheetah is eyeing for dinner. And the sabertoothed tiger joins a family for breakfast in an offbeat Hyundai spot.\n\nDon't rule out a real dinosaur showing up next year.\n\n• Ads go long. At $3.8 million per 30-second slot, it might seem that cost-conscious Super Bowl advertisers would all try to ram their messages into a very tight time-frame.\n\nNot this go-round. This Super Bowl comes complete with at least two, two-minute commercials, and several full-minute spots.\n\nChrysler has done it before. Its two-minute spots at halftime last year featured Clint Eastwood and the year before had Eminem. The carmaker is believed to have at least one, two-minute commercial in this year's game, but is keeping mum.\n\nSamsung, however, isn't keeping mum. Its two-minute spot, featuring three comic actors and LeBron James, is all about trying to call attention to its own coolness factor.\n\nWhile the arguments for two minutes in terms of prominence and story-telling are compelling, the risks are huge. Two minutes is an enormous amount of time to capture and keep the attention of a generation more accustomed to 140-character tweets and five-second sound bites. While a 30-second dud on the Super Bowl can be a yawn, a 120-second dud can be a brand buster.\n\n• Put up your dukes. It might seem that there's nothing new about fists flying during the Super Bowl — particularly during the commercial breaks. After all, a fight is a fight, right?\n\nNot this year. Some of the bigger punch-outs aren't about guys fighting guys, but about guys fighting wild animals — and women beating up dudes. These are all staged slapstick fights, of course, aimed at luring frazzled viewers to give a look.\n\nIn the Kia spot the former Miss USA as a robot basically pulverizes the guy, while in Coke's commercial, a Las Vegas showgirl beats the pants off a motorcycle dude.\n\nThings get even weirder in a couple of spots that pit man against beast. If the Skechers ad isn't enough, there's the Axe ad in which a hunk of a lifeguard beats the be-jeebers out of a shark that is about to attack a bikini babe.\n\nAre you watching, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals?\n\n• Name that tune. Savvy advertisers know that on Super Bowl Sunday, it's not just what viewers will see that matters, but also what they hear. While all the commercial images can become a blur, the right music can turn heads.\n\nMusic, also, is generational. Marketers typically use it to hit the target they want. On Super Bowl Sunday, it's at the most focused. While Volkswagen, for example, is using famous YouTube rants to appeal to Millennials, it's also reaching out to Baby Boomers with a musical nod to their past: The familiar theme song to the Partridge Family Come on Get Happy, re-created by reggae legend Jimmy Cliff.\n\nTaco Bell, meanwhile, is setting its spot to music — but with a Spanish twist. The commercial, about ol' folks breaking out the retirement home for a night of romping, is a Spanish language version of We Are Young.\n\nPepsi, of course, has Beyonce singing at halftime. And then there's Wonderful Pistachios, which convinced YouTube sensation Psy to pen new, nut-worthy words to his Internet hit, Gangnam Style.\n\n• Guys as goofballs. There was a time when the guys who showed up in Super Bowl commercials were as tough as the guys on the field.\n\nThat was followed by a far different time, when the guys in the Big Game spots became touchy-feely wimps.\n\nNow we're in yet another era: guys as goofballs.\n\nAn ad for Pepsi Next focuses on a father who's apparently more concerned with the calories in his soda than his kid's party that's destroying his home. A Kia spot features a dad who mindlessly spins an absurd tale for his kid who asked where babies come from. A Century 21 spot stars a groom who literally faints at the altar when he's told his mother-in-law will be moving in.\n\n• Wishing and hoping. There's apparently a new way to make dreams come true in 2013: watch the Super Bowl ads.\n\nThe theme embraced by several advertisers is the notion of one's fondest wishes being granted — almost in fairy godmother-like style.\n\nToyota is doing it with its \"Wish Granted\" spot, featuring actress Kaley Cuoco. In the ad, Cuoco tosses clouds of pixie dust that appear to make wishes come true.\n\nLikewise, Taco Bell latches onto the trend, magically giving a group of senior citizens a very special, youth-driven night out on the town — ending up, of course, at Taco Bell.\n\nThen, in a couple of Bud Light spots, rabid fans reach out for a magic touch to help their teams win.\n\nBut the real wishing and hoping Sunday night will be on the part of every Super Bowl advertiser who wants to achieve lightning in a bottle.\n\nBut faster than you can say poof, most will disappear.\n\nThe roster of Super Bowl advertisers:\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Beck's serenade\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Black Crown coronation\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Black Crown celebration\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Bud Light journey\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Bud Light chair\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev: Budweiser Clydesdales\n\nAudi: Prom-goer in dad's Audi\n\nAxe (Unilever): Girl goes for astronaut\n\nBest Buy: Amy Poehler seeks help\n\nBlackberry (RIM): Blackberry 10 phone\n\nCalvin Klein: Man vs. Machine\n\nCars.com: No stress car buying\n\nCentury 21: Groom faints at wedding\n\nChrysler\n\nCoca-Cola: Who gets to Coke oasis?\n\nDoritos: First consumer ad winner\n\nDoritos: Second consumer ad winner\n\nE-Trade: E-Trade baby returns\n\nGildan Activewear: Guy wants his t-shirt\n\nGoDaddy: Model kisses geek\n\nGoDaddy: Danica Patrick is pilot 30\n\nHyundai: Epic play date\n\nHyundai: Boy takes on bullies\n\nHyundai: Sonata turbo passes\n\nKia: Where babies come from\n\nKia: Robot woman gets tough\n\nLincoln (Ford): Wacky road trip\n\nM&Ms (Mars): M&Ms sing\n\nMercedes-Benz: Kate Upton\n\nMilk Processors Education Program: \"The Rock\" hunts for milk\n\nMio (Kraft): Change is good\n\nNational Football League: Players thank fans\n\nOreo: Cookie debate\n\nParamount Pictures: \"Star Trek Into Darkness\"\n\nPepsi: Party with Pepsi Next\n\nPepsi: Halftime introduction\n\nSamsung Mobile: Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd\n\nSkechers: Guy outruns cheetah\n\nSodaStream: Soda bottles explode\n\nSpeed Stick: Guy folds panties\n\nSubway: Jocks congratulate Jared\n\nTaco Bell: Seniors night out\n\nTide (Procter & Gamble): Both teams featured\n\nToyota: Kaley Cuoco grants wishes\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nVolkswagen: Happy office worker\n\nWalt Disney \"Iron Man 3\"\n\nWalt Disney: \"Lone Ranger\"\n\nWalt Disney: \"Oz\"\n\nWonderful Pistachios \"Gagnam Style\" star Psy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/investing/unilever-stock-nelson-peltz-dove/index.html", "title": "Nelson Peltz comes after Hellmann's and Dove | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA shakeup may be in the works at Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind brands like Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Vaseline.\n\nUnilever (UL) announced Monday that Nelson Peltz, one of the most influential corporate raiders on Wall Street, will join the company’s board of directors and disclosed that Peltz’s fund holds a 1.5% stake in Unilever (UL).\n\nPeltz is an activist investor known for pushing under-performing companies to restructure, spin-off businesses and even break up. In the past, he has helped force changes at food and consumer giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Wendy’s (WEN).\n\nIt’s not immediately clear what Peltz has planned for London-based Unilever, which has lagged rivals in recent years and made three failed bids to acquire GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer health care business.\n\nIn January, Unilever said it was cutting 1,500 management jobs around the world and simplifying its business structure.\n\nSome analysts have called for Unilever to split its food and drink brands from its home and personal care division.\n\nWall Street, however, is betting that Peltz will help transform Unilever. Shares rose 8% during early trading Tuesday. Analysts say the company needs a major revamp.\n\n“Unilever has a double problem,” said AllianceBernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. The company is in “structurally low growth categories” and investors have lost confidence in the board and management.\n\nMonteyne expects Peltz to bring Unilever “back to basics” and focus on investing in innovation, adjusting executive compensation incentives and accelerating the pace of acquisitions and sales.\n\nUnilever has been on Peltz’s radar for months. In January, the Financial Times reported that he acquired a stake in the company. On Monday, Unilever chair Nils Anderson said in a statement that the company has held “extensive and constructive discussions” with Peltz.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/02/january-2019-free-food-meal-deals-and-other-savings/2461085002/", "title": "January 2019 free food, meal deals and other savings", "text": "January is the month of resolutions.\n\nAnd if you're resolving to save more money in 2019, you've come to the right place.\n\nWelcome to USA TODAY's January guide of free food, meal deals, made-up food holidays and other savings.\n\nOne of the month's sweetest days is Jan. 23, which is National Pie Day not to be confused with Pi Day held March 14.\n\nBookmark this page because it'll be updated frequently with more specials.\n\nHere are the deals, big days and ongoing specials, available at participating locations.

Because it’s convenient? Because you don’t have to get dressed up, because you could just sit there? How can you call that entertainment, alone in your living room? Where’s the other people? Where’s the audience? Where’s the magic? I tell you, in a place like this, the magic is all around you.”\n\n— Dialogue from the movie, \"The Majestic\"\n\n+++\n\nMovie magic is all around southeast Iowa.\n\nEntrepreneurs and communities have joined hands to restore 19th and 20th century entertainment palaces. Using a blend of technology, creature comforts and marketing savvy — not to mention hot, buttery popcorn — they keep filling theater seats in small downtowns.\n\nThe movie business is tough in rural markets, said Brian Fridley, vice president of Des Moines-based R.L. Fridley Theatres. The company has sold some of its properties at bargain prices and even given away others, such as the Temple Twin in Mount Pleasant. Scott and Amy Lowe couldn’t imagine their town without its theater, so they jumped on Fridley’s offer of a free building in 2012.\n\nAided by a $40,000 grant from the city, the Lowes wasted no time in launching a $400,000 renovation of the former Masonic Temple, uncovering high ceilings and crown moldings that would help them recapture the structure’s 1920s flavor. Customers would thank them for replacing grimy restrooms, carpet and seating that, in Scott’s words, “assaulted every one of the senses.”\n\nIn a nod both to Disneyland and the theater’s downtown location, the Lowes renamed the business Main Street Cinemas. Customers flocked back in to enjoy modern amenities like digital projection, Dolby Surround Sound and rocker-back seats with cup holders and leg room.\n\nFrom the restored, digitally lit marquee to the plush-carpeted lobby hung with classic movie images to the gold-accented, red-and-black paint scheme, the intent was to make the theater “a place you want to be,” and offer a different experience than watching movies in a modern multiplex.\n\nThe enlarged concession stand and expanded menu offering pretzel bites, pizza, wine and beer is part of the effort to differentiate. Popcorn, soda and candy remain the top sellers.\n\nThe improvements were well received.\n\n“We were pleasantly surprised with the public appreciation and the business uptick we saw,” said Mr. Lowe.\n\nFridley, meanwhile, was restoring to the State Theater in Washington to its 1946 look. After a 2010 fire caused extensive smoke and water damage to the former downtown opera house, Fridley utilized historic tax credits and grants funneled through Washington’s downtown revitalization group for improvements including digital projection, surround sound, new seats and carpets, remodeled concession area and reopened balcony.\n\n“The community is loving it,” manager Crystle Christner said of the restoration.\n\nShe doesn’t think Washingtonians would support a multiplex.\n\n“Sixty-five to 70 percent of our population is retired. They don’t want new-fangled stuff,” said Christner. Customers like getting popcorn from a well-seasoned machine that’s been popping since 1948, she said.\n\nWhile Washington and Mount Pleasant play mainly recent or first-run movies, Burlington’s restored Capitol Theater and Performance Center specializes in classic films and live events. Owned by a non-profit foundation that has raised $2.5 million for improvements, the Capitol offers concerts, classes and workshops and a venue for local high school and college drama productions.\n\nThe investment in digital projection at Burlington, Mount Pleasant and Washington is expensive — costs run upwards of $100,000 per screen — but the technology opens a new world of possibilities. Besides enabling 3D movies, captioning and language options, the digital systems allows computer scheduling and play of feature movies, commercials, preview and announcements. Even light and sound levels can be preset with the system.\n\nAnything that can be viewed on a computer can now be projected to the big screen. That capability allowed Main Street Cinemas to invite customers to turn out in tuxes and evening gowns for cocktails and a viewing of the Academy Awards. The Capitol is planning a video game event to utilize its digital capacity.\n\nWhen the Capitol was built in the dreary Depression days of 1937, says manager Jerry Johnson, “going to the theater was supposed to transport you to another land, to put you in a majestic place you wouldn’t normally be.”\n\nEven in 2015, when entertainment can be streamed to any device, anytime, anywhere, Iowa’s small communities still have plenty of people who still want to be transported, to experience the magic of laughing, screaming or clapping as they watch a movie on the big screen — together.\n\nA CLOSER LOOK AT SOUTHEAST IOWA THEATERS\n\nCapitol Theatre, 211 N. Third St., Burlington, IA 52601, 319-237-1099\n\nExecutive Director: Jerry Johnson\n\nwww.burlingtoncapitoltheater.com\n\nThe then-state-of-the-art, 700-seat Capitol Theater opened in 1937 with a showing of \"The Prince and the Pauper,\" starring Errol Flynn, and operated until 1977, when it closed with a showing of \"Carrie.\" It took 25 years for the Capitol Theater Foundation to form and raise funds to reopen the facility as a movie theater and performing arts center. Programming includes a $5 Classic Movie Series, Cheap Date Movie Nights, Family Movie Sundays, the Annual Snake Alley Film Festival, concerts, local drama performances, classes and workshops. Concessions include wine and beer.\n\nGrand Theatre, 26 N. 6th Street, Keokuk, IA 52632, 319-524-1026\n\nPat Kemp, member of Grand Theatre Commission\n\nkeokukgrandtheatre .org\n\nBuilt on the foundation of the Keokuk Opera House, which burned in 1923, the Grand opened in 1925 and was known “as the finest theater west of the Mississippi,” according to local resident Pat Kemp. Traveling vaudeville companies played there and movies there were well attended but the theater fell on hard times, opening and closing repeatedly. The Bott-Millar Charitable Trust saved the Grand from the wrecking ball and turned it over to the city, which delegated upkeep and management to the 15-member Grand Theatre Commission. No movies are shown but the Grand is booked about 50 weekends per year for meetings and performances.\n\nOrpheum Theater, 121 West Broadway Ave., Fairfield, IA 52556\n\nBuilding owner: Johnson Real Estate, 641-469-1919\n\nThe Orpheum Theater opened in 1910 and operated until 1940, when it closed for remodeling. Students from Parsons College won a contest for the best redesign idea, so when the theater reopened on Christmas Day that year, the name was changed to the Co-Ed Theater in their honor. The Co-Ed closed in September 2012 and reopened in 2014 under the ownership of Modern American Cinema, which changed its name back to the Orpheum, and briefly showed a mix of blockbusters, independent, foreign and documentary films before closing. The theater has a 1920-30s atmosphere and is equipped with lounge and sofa seating, digital projection and sound equipment, according to owner Chris Johnson. It opens for rentals and special events, such as the recent, sold-out Creative Edge Film Festival.\n\nMain Street Cinemas, 115 N. Main St., Mount Pleasant, IA 52641, 385-3726\n\nKelly Miyoshi, manager\n\nwww.mainstreetcinemas.net\n\nThe former Temple Twin Theater was remodeled in 2013 and renamed Main Street Cinemas by new owners Scott and Amy Lowe. The facility shows first-run and recent movies, including 3D, on two screens. The recently expanded concession stand serves popcorn, candy, soda, pretzel bites and pizza. Wine and beer is available for consumption on 21-and-up balconies with enhanced sound and seating. The theater is available for rental to school and church groups and other organizations.\n\nState Theatre, 123 East Washington, Washington, Iowa, 319-653-4023\n\nManager: Crystle Christner\n\nwww.fridleytheatres.com/washington.html\n\nBuilt in 1893 as the Graham Opera House, the facility first showed movies in 1897. Washington resident W. Frank Brinton showed some of the earliest silent films there until World War I.

Since then, the company has grown rapidly, and it now has nearly 2,100 employees. The company does not disclose its revenue.\n\nCEO and third-generation leader Brad Lindner met with The Enquirer to discuss the way the company operates, recent success and future plans.\n\nOh, and ice cream.\n\nHere is a portion of Lindner's hour-long interview with The Enquirer, with some questions and answers edited for brevity.\n\nTo what do you credit UDF's recent successes?\n\nI think probably a couple of key things, one of which is the legacy that we inherited from my grandfather, father, uncles and aunt. Not only the business itself, but the approach to business. They probably trained us well by their example to treat people – both employees, customers, vendors – with the respect that they deserve, to be fair, to have that commitment to quality, yet also combine that with creating value or having value.\n\nWe always strive to offer the best that we can for a reasonable price. And we frankly have been very fortunate to have outstanding people working for us over the years, who have been very committed to the company and what they do, what it stands for.\n\nHow do you balance the legacy that came from your family with your own innovative approach?\n\nThat’s the tightrope that one walks, which is holding on to those things that are core values and looking at the past for some direction, but not constantly focusing on the past. One needs to look at the future and be responsive to changes in business and society and demographics.\n\nI think the other important factor is to hire good people, and hire people with outside experience. There’s a nice mix of processes and approaches that have been successful and gotten us to this point, and bringing in fresh ideas from a lot of different large companies, people who have had past experience with large companies. Having those ideas, techniques, approaches blend in with some of the old historical approaches. It’s a combination of a Fortune 500 blended with a small family business. You try to strike a balance and get the best of both worlds, so there’s a sense of professionalism, sense of urgency, but also a sense of familiarity, a sense of humor, and a sense of camaraderie.\n\nYou mentioned looking forward to the future. What's in store in the future?\n\nWe are working on a new store prototype, and hopefully we will have some examples of that finished in the second quarter of next year.\n\nI think we probably are using more research in general to help guide us, to help make some decisions, as opposed to just relying on internal opinions or gut feel. We’re back checking some things and getting a better understanding of who our customers are. That’s been a more recent push for us.\n\nWith dealing with our training of our people, developing our people, putting more of an emphasis on that... There are a lot of mandated training modules that store employees have to go through in respect to alcohol sales, tobacco sales and (payment card industry) compliance. Years and years ago, before we had those, we could focus more time on how to make a sundae or how to make a malt. It’s evolved over the years. The oxygen in the training room has been sucked up a lot by those mandated modules that have to be by law trained. I think we will look to add emphasis and training hours back to those skills that are specific to the dairy, primarily, around ice cream treats and how to make those.\n\nVaguely speaking, what will the new store prototype be like?\n\nAgain, it’s kind of looking at that balance of what worked for us in the past and the opportunities going forward. There’s going to be more emphasis on coffee, fast food, refrigerated space, specifically adding beer barns to the store, which we have a number of, but that’s been pretty successful. Emphasizing the fountain beverages – the soft drinks, that come out of the machine. A bit more fresh thematically.\n\nWhat has been your biggest success or accomplishment and your biggest failure since becoming CEO in 1998?\n\nWhen I say I, I’m talking euphemistically for the company. Our biggest successes has been to offer UDF branded gasoline. We used to offer branded Mobil gasoline for close to 12 years. That was good at the time. We learned a lot, we got a lot of experience. I think we gained a lot of credibility and respect in the consumer’s mind with respect to our fuel and our fuel offering. But by delinking with Mobil, we improved our purchase price of fuel considerably.\n\nAs far as failures go, that’s a long list. Generally speaking, my biggest failure – and I won’t be real specific – but it’s when we’ve hired or I have hired somebody and discovered that it wasn’t a good fit, not reacting fast enough to enact a change to let it work itself out...I’m getting better at that, but hiring people is really challenging. Interviewing people and trying to get a sense of who’s really sitting there. Are they really just play acting for a couple hours to convince you and then somebody else show up on the first day of work?\n\nHow many hours do you work? I’ve heard your Dad was notorious for being in here on weekends.\n\nSundays not too much. He would always be in church on Sundays, but Saturdays he would come in during the morning and typically do that for half a day.\n\nI don’t have the same rigor he does. I’m more of a five-day-a-weeker, although realistically it’s very difficult to detach yourself from work. ... Your mind is engaged all the time on things at work. Obviously you can enjoy a game or a TV show or a movie or something like that, and be distracted. Whether cutting the grass or doing something, I find myself problem-solving or thinking about what’s transpired the last week, what has to happen the next week or the next year or so on.\n\nYour Dad still comes to work, correct? The receptionist tried to send me to him when I said I was here to see Mr. Lindner.\n\nYeah, he just turned another major milestone this year, which was his 95th birthday. He still comes in on a daily basis. He doesn’t come in as early as he used to, and he doesn’t stay as late as he used to, but that’s a wonderful thing – to have your Dad around at 95. Most of the time it’s a wonderful thing (laughing).\n\nDoes he ever give you advice?\n\nOh yeah. Not as much as he used to.\n\nI give him a lot of credit. Often time in family business I think, the patriarch or the person who started the business has a hard time letting go and passing responsibilities on to the next generation. I’m fortunate to have two other brothers working here. And more recently, two of my children have started working here. I give Dad a lot of credit for letting us take the reins.\n\nYour family is so well-known in Cincinnati. Does being in the public eye have any downsides?\n\nWe’re probably more cut from the cloth to stay out of the limelight, and that makes it a bit more challenging to do so. To maintain some sense of privacy is a bit more challenging. I think to a large degree most of my uncles and father and aunt preferred to be behind the scenes instead of being out front, on display.\n\nI’ve heard that UDF is in the process of expanding in Dayton and Columbus. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nBased on some of our research, we found specifically in Columbus that people like us. They like to shop at our store. They like our ice cream... Looking at the concentration of dairy stores in Cincinnati relative to Dayton and Columbus, we thought we would focus more of our efforts on those two markets in the upcoming future.\n\nAny other markets that you’re interested in?\n\nWe’ve had some pretty good success in country markets... Out in the country, there’s not a lot of opportunity to go get a scoop of ice cream. You can get a whippy dip, but that’s different than a hand-dipped hot fudge sundae or a chocolate malt.\n\nYou mentioned that two of your kids are involved in the company now. What do they do?\n\nOne is an assistant brand manager for us, and the other is a category manager. ... Both of them came up through the stores. They started out going through clerk training and working as a clerk, and then came into the office.\n\nIs your daughter who’s at Occidental College in Los Angeles interested at all in the business?\n\nI don’t think so. She’s more of a STEM person. She started out in chemistry, and that was a little bit too dry for her, so she moved to biology. ... Hopefully she’ll pursue something that follows her college degree.\n\nHave any of your kids expressed an interest in someday taking on a bigger role?\n\n...I think I have had the conversation with them. Ideally, they get a broad sense of experience throughout the company, so they are better at whatever they end up doing. Who knows – maybe they’ll even go somewhere else and do something other than this. This is a great opportunity for them to gain really intricate knowledge in a broad breadth of experience, in a lot of different disciplines and functions, and come away with an understanding of how business operates and what it takes to be successful.\n\nHave you thought about how long you want to stay CEO?\n\nOccasionally, yes (laughing).\n\nHaving two other brothers engaged, I would say it’s a good partnership. ... I’m thankful for those guys being here. Frankly, I wouldn’t want to be the lone guy in charge. I really enjoy and appreciate the knowledge that they bring, the experience that they bring to the party.\n\nAt some point, it would be nice to shove a little more stuff on my younger brother and free up a little bit more time. He’s 10 years younger than I am. Maybe I could take a two-week vacation sometime, but I don’t have any specific timeline.\n\nOkay, I have one more question. It’s the most important question…\n\nWhat’s my favorite flavor?\n\nYes. I’m sure you’ve been asked that before.\n\nFrankly, that’s kind of a hard one. I don’t know if I could have one favorite flavor. If I had to say one, probably it would be our homemade chocolate.\n\nWhy?\n\nFlavor, body and texture. We use a really good cocoa out of the Netherlands that I think really offers a superior flavor. I like chocolate, and this is a good chocolate. A lot of chocolates I think are a little bit kind of weak. Whether it’s the type of cocoa powder they use, or the amount they use. Ours is not harsh, but it’s kind of a good balance of chocolaty goodness.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/26"}]}

He would go on to intern at Fendi with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, which sparked a longtime collaboration with the rapper.\n\nAbloh was behind several of Ye's notable album covers, including 2010's \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\" 2011's \"Watch the Throne\" with Jay-Z and 2013's \"Yeezus.\" The rapper was in attendance for Abloh's first Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week in 2019, where the two were photographed warmly embracing afterward.\n\nHis work with Ye served as a blueprint for future border-crossing collaborations that married high and low. With Nike, he partnered his Off-White label for a line of frenzy-inducing sneakers remixed with a variety of styles and Helvetica fonts. Abloh also designed furniture for IKEA, refillable bottles for Evian and Big Mac cartons for McDonald's. His work was exhibited at the Louvre, the Gagosian and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.\n\nPassages: Stephen Sondheim, iconic Broadway composer and lyricist, dies at 91\n\nAbloh, who moonlighted as a DJ, often stressed how vital music was to his creative process.\n\n\"I can’t work in my studio without music.

He played international gigs including at the nightclub Hï Ibiza in Spain, was booked for 2019's Tomorrowland music festival in Germany and held a DJ residency at Wynn Las Vegas's XS Nightclub that same year.\n\nAbloh made several recent public appearances, including at the Met Gala in September and the Fashion Trust Arabia Prize Gala on Nov. 3.\n\nIn 2018, as Abloh prepared for his debut menswear show, he told GQ, \"I now have a platform to change the industry.\"\n\n\"We’re designers, so we can start a trend, we can highlight issues, we can make a lot of people focus on something or we can cause a lot of people to focus on ourselves,\" Abloh said. \"I’m not interested in (the latter).

Or are stars truly dedicated to being in the office, giving input and helping to advance a brand's product innovation?\n\n\"Everyone's out there endorsing something, and this (trend) makes it a little bit more authentic,\" says Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. \"Where it will really work is when a celebrity will make an interesting or good contribution; it adds value to the brand. It's a secondary association that will create positive imagery around the brand.\"\n\nWintour is a veteran journalist, and her contributions as artistic director to the company that owns and publishes her magazine fall well within her realm of expertise. But, when consumers hear about Timberlake aligning himself with Bud Light Platinum or Keys taking on the role of \"global creative director\" for BlackBerry, are they more likely to reach for their wallets, or scratch their heads?\n\nUltimately, the move to hire stars as more than just pretty faces is contingent upon consumers buying into the notion that the partnership is authentic, sensible and credible, says Kimberly Hairston, a brand architect and senior beauty executive who has worked for Coca-Cola, Unilever and L'Oreal.\n\n\"I've read some of the blogs and people have kind of said, 'What?! Alicia Keys? BlackBerry?' Just because you love technology doesn't necessarily make you an expert,\" Hairston says. \"I'm not sure if (she's) bringing, besides awareness, credibility to position a brand and really move the brand forward.\"\n\nHowever, Keys tells USA TODAY via e-mail that accepting the BlackBerry title was about connecting her fans to the latest technology.\n\n\"As an artist, I am looking to connect to others, to inspire them, to move them, through our common connections. To do this, it's vital for me to stay ahead of the technological curve,\" she writes. \"I wanted to further explore the potential of working with a technology company to deepen those connections, and where possible use my unique experience and platform to influence and inspire creativity. That's where we align — finding ways to connect with audiences everywhere and embracing the changes and technology that make this possible.\"\n\nCredibility aside, even if the connection between celebrity and brand is not obvious on the surface, a well-connected, A-list star brings a specific value to a company, says Copic: insight into consumers.\n\n\"Will.i.am is playing to millions of fans all over the world, so he understands the intensity of that relationship between him or his band and that consumer,\" Copic says of the Black Eyed Peas frontman, who has served as Intel's director of creative innovation since 2012. \"He knows how they live, and that's who these companies are trying to target at the end of the day. Intel, in their battle with Apple, needs to know how to better resonate.\"\n\nFor celebrities and the companies who hire them, creative direction is the intersection between the roles of employee and endorser, and the terms should be clear, says Daymond John, the founder of clothing company FUBU and an investor/mentor on ABC's business reality competition Shark Tank.\n\nWhen he launched FUBU 20 years ago, John says, rapper LL Cool J and other musicians were \"integral\" to some creative and promotional aspects of the line, but he would not go so far as to name a star \"creative director.\"\n\n\"Because we're a design firm; we're creative,\" John explains. \"Ambassador, yes? Creative director, no. Because, then they'd say, 'Well, then what the hell is your job?!'\"\n\n\"You're seeing the evolution of celebrities,\" Copic says. \"Justin Timberlake, moving from boy band idol to solo artist to actor and now he is one of the co-owners of MySpace. You're seeing a handful of actors and singers who have a business bent. … Whether they are co-owners in a company or really go down this creative director route, they're lending their unique insights on consumers.\"\n\nRihanna's collaboration with MAC is the first of its kind, as the singer was named the cosmetics company's inaugural \"creative partner\" in February. James Gager, who is MAC's creative director, says he and the team were clear about distinguishing her title from his and detailing exactly how she would contribute to the brand.\n\n\"It could be considered a vague title since I'm the creative director of the brand, but for us, Rihanna is one of those people that as creative partner, she can keep coming and going within the brand as she'd like to or we'd like her to, and she can have new ideas,\" Gager says. \"She's bringing something to the brand that me as a creative director, I'm not a woman. I'm a guy looking at it from a different kind of perspective. She's our ultimate user. In her pocketbook when she came in, her makeup bag was mostly all MAC product, and she was already wearing a lot of the stuff that we're just tweaking a little bit for her.\"\n\nThe collaboration, Gager adds, was not just about tweaking products that already existed and giving Rihanna credit. He says that the ever-busy singer, whose four-part collection will roll out throughout the year starting May 4, \"worked with her whole heart and soul\" on the project.\n\n\"She had done her homework. She knew what colors she really wanted to have in the collection. She knew what looked amazingly good on her. She had a point of view about the packaging and where she wanted the packaging to be, as well as the textures of the products. She was in the office, working with us!\" he says. \"It's not like someone getting paid some money and we're going to slap their name on something. That isn't really how we work here. … We're real. It's not a small percentage that Rihanna worked on this.\"\n\nNaturally, any sort of celebrity-brand partnership will call into question whether a star is actually contributing or if they're just collecting a paycheck. Gager says he's well aware of the stigma, but maintains that it doesn't apply in this case.\n\n\"Consumers are not stupid. I think they see deals with celebrities where they're maybe done for the money vs. the authentic quality of what the association might be. I know I'm not naive about what goes on, and I feel like when we really are real, people admire us for that.\"\n\nWhat consumers are admiring less and less, though, are pure endorsement deals, and tapping celebs to be creative directors may be one way to turn the tide, says entertainment publicist Tara Smith.\n\n\"Every brand has some type of celebrity attached to it, so it kind of defeats the purpose after a while. There has to be authenticity to it all, too. If you're coming across as 'I'm-saying-this-because-you're-paying-me-to-say-it,' people don't go for that anymore. But, if you bring them in to make it seem like they are part of the company, like they do have some type of creative control or like they do have some say in their campaigns, then people may be a little bit more (open).\"\n\nIt will take more than just semantics to get today's customers on board, though, says Essence magazine entertainment editor Cori Murray.\n\n\"People who are true fans and who really follow (celebs') lives will start to try and pick (the creative director title) apart and be like, 'Well, that means this.' When they have this big, lofty title attached to some company, I think it does bring consumers to pause, as opposed to something that's just a collaboration, or more of a traditional endorsement.\"\n\nCreative direction doesn't always go in the right direction for every brand.\n\nKeys, who received her new title from struggling smartphone company BlackBerry on Jan. 30, got backlash less than two weeks after her appointment when a tweet posted from her Twitter account indicated that it had been sent from an iPhone. She later tweeted that her account was hacked, but Hairston says the damage to her credibility was already done.\n\n\"Her iPhone! Her iPhone! Yes! I can give you so many times where that's happened where a celebrity endorses one product, but loves another. That is where I find it almost like 'nepotism celebritism.' It is just based on your name.

Guests were ferried by yachts to the star-studded affair held on an island. Celebrity attendees, including Kim Kardashian West and her daughter North, Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, model Bella Hadid, Ricky Martin, Rauw Alejandro, Joe Jonas, Maluma and Pharrell, arrived in sleek LV monogrammed silver speedboats.\n\nKid Cudi and Erykah Badu performed at an after-party. “Hey Virgil,” she yelled at the start of her set, later saying “we want to see you fly.”\n\nAbloh, who died Sunday after a lengthy battle with cancer, was known for pushing boundaries as the head of the legendary French fashion house, thanks to his childlike curiosity and an eagerness to instill a sense of playfulness. His groundbreaking fusions of streetwear and high couture made him one of the most celebrated tastemakers.\n\nA focal point of the show was a giant, red LV monogrammed hot air balloon that puffed flames as Abloh’s voice was heard in the background.\n\nThe brand’s CEO Michael Burke said Abloh’s wife and family wanted the show to go on. He had just spoken to the young designer on Saturday night, describing the inspiration for the show as a coming of age of sorts because “inspiring future generations was very important to Virgil.”\n\n“We had imagined it all and he was distraught not to be here in person,” Burke said.\n\nModels walked the meandering runway, showcasing the collection that featured everything from neon-colored amphibian, aqua-gear looks with colorful fish backpacks to letterman-style school sweaters and snow bunny looks with furry boots.\n\nThere was a sleek matte black ensemble that resembled SWAT gear, military-style suits in olive with belted coats and even brightly color Southern-belle style hoop skirts. Prints included tie-dye hues and the iconic checkered logo redone in new color patterns.\n\nWhile the clothes were like Abloh — playful, colorful and vibrant — the mood was somber. During and after the show, many in the audience wiped away tears, standing to hug each other or offer a pat of comfort.\n\nThe sparse clapping at the end was awkward. Unlike most shows, no one got up to mingle or talk, but instead sat in heavy silence.\n\nThe designer’s traditional finale bow was not coming and never would again and as fireworks lit up the Miami skyline, the audience seemed painfully aware of his absence.\n\nInstead, the show circled back to the bold hot air balloon as the designer’s voice said “life is short” for “worrying about what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do” — a sort of anthem that a generation of young fans rallied behind.\n\nLamont Spears traveled from Atlanta just for the show, wearing a fuzzy LV monogrammed hoodie coat and a sweatshirt with Abloh’s picture.\n\n“It’s a very sad moment, but we’ve got to celebrate his life, we’ve got to keep on pushing because he made a way for us to keep going, to keep being confident,” said the 35-year-old. “He showed me that I can.”\n\nAbloh in 2018 became the first Black man to serve as Louis Vuitton’s director of men’s wear in the French design house’s storied history. He grew up outside of Chicago, his first-generation Ghanaian American seamstress mother teaching him to sew.\n\nNew York stylist Memsor Kamarake, who saw Abloh’s first show in Paris, flew in specifically for the final tribute, saying through tears after the fireworks, “I felt like now I can finally grieve him.”\n\n“So often Black folks are depicted through pain, through struggle, that’s why it was so important for him to tap into this childlike joy,” Kamarake said.\n\nAbove a red carpet leading to an outdoor after-party, the sky lit up with red dots that danced in various configurations before coming together to say “Virgil was here.”\n\nAbloh, who founded his own Off-White label in 2013, had a vast creative presence outside of clothing. His sculpture “Dollar a Gallon,” unveiled this week during Art Basel, is a commentary on the effect of advertising on the impressionable.\n\nVirgil Abloh, trailblazing Louis Vuitton director, dies after private cancer battle at 41\n\nHe also designed furniture for IKEA, refillable bottles for Evian and Big Mac cartons for McDonald’s. His work was exhibited at the Louvre, the Gagosian and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.\n\nAbloh had a prominent influence in streetwear. He interned with Ye at the LVMH brand Fendi, was the rapper’s creative director and scored a Grammy nomination as art director for the 2011 Ye-Jay-Z album “Watch the Throne.”\n\n“I think it’s going to be the most important moment ever in LV history,” said David Filipucci, a 21-year-old who traveled from the Netherlands to attend the show.\n\n“LV for the moment is Virgil.

The flight from New York City to Rome with a stop in Paris broke apart and fell into the ocean below. The 230 people onboard Trans World Airlines Flight 800 perished.\n\nAs quickly as the wreckage plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, questions arose. Conspiracy theories took shape.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the questions and conspiracies live on.\n\nFollowing a four-year, $40 million investigation – the longest in the history of the National Transportation Safety Board – board officials concluded an electrical failure ignited fuel vapors in a nearly empty tank in the belly of the jet.\n\nTheories that Flight 800 may have been destroyed by a bomb, missile or meteor have nonetheless lingered.\n\nTWA Flight 800:Remnants to be scrapped, 25 years after explosion killed 230 passengers, crew\n\nAs recently as July 2014, NTSB officials had to publicly respond to requests to reconsider its findings in the investigation of the 1996 crash. Petitioners from a high-profile group called The TWA 800 Project claimed a “detonation or high-velocity explosion” caused the crash. An NTSB review determined the claim cast insufficient doubt of a flawed initial investigation.\n\nOn the day of the crash, witnesses said they saw a streak of light near the plane and one or more explosions near the aircraft. Speculation bloomed that the crash had been touched off by a proximity-triggered rocket, missile or flare.\n\nThe day after the crash, the possibility that an explosive device was fired toward the plane or placed inside before takeoff took hold. The Federal Bureau of Investigation considered potential terrorist links and began a criminal investigation.\n\n230 people perished when TWA Flight 800 exploded. 25 years later, the wounds are 'still raw.'\n\nConspiracies were born\n\nAt the time, fears of domestic terrorism were high. The nation was still processing the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1995 Oklahoma City explosion and the trial of Ramzi Yousef for conspiracy to destroy American-bound airliners. Ten days after the crash, a bombing rocked the Atlanta Olympics.\n\nNTSB officials quickly said the initial evidence surrounding the crash of Flight 800 did not point to an outside explosive device. Still, speculation stemming from eyewitness accounts spread through chat rooms on the burgeoning World Wide Web.\n\nShane Miller, a professor at Saint John’s University in Minnesota who researched the conspiracy theories surrounding the crash, said the Flight 800 conspirators used the web in novel ways.\n\n“It was really the first conspiracy of the internet age,” Miller said. “It was the first to be picked up and widely circulated online.”\n\nMichael Barkun, professor emeritus of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said internet forums and social media platforms have served as mass media outlets without gatekeepers. They allow unconventional ideas to quickly become mainstream.\n\n“Now anyone with an idea, no matter how bizarre, has a way of potentially getting it in front of fairly large audiences,” he said. “That has eroded what was once a firm boundary between the fringe and the mainstream.”\n\nAccidents that changed aviation:Controlling in-flight fires and more\n\nTed Goertzel, emeritus professor of sociology at Rutgers University said the internet has been a game changer for conspiracy theory consumption and evolution. The way the theories germinate nonetheless remains relatively standard.\n\nConspiracy theories regularly emerge from idle speculation in the face of more probable explanations, Goertzel said. They often gain acceptance and spread from those “who score low in measures of interpersonal trust and general agreeableness,” he added.\n\n“Someone says, 'I wonder if X happened,' \" Goertzel said. \"Someone else says, 'I heard X' and it spreads.\"\n\nAs the theory that federal officials were covering up a terrorist attack to thwart panic spread, it evolved and eventually split, Miller said. Both camps agreed on a government coverup. However, the divergent group blamed friendly fire.\n\nOne early version posted online alleged the crash resulted from an attack designed to kill former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was, in fact, not on board. Another claimed the friendly fire was designed to kill former Arkansas state troopers once assigned to then-President Bill Clinton’s security detail.\n\nThe one that took off was an August 1996 America Online post claiming the airplane was “shot down by a U.S. Navy guided-missile ship.” The information came from Richard Russell, a 66-year-old former United Airlines pilot and safety representative for the Air Line Pilots Association.\n\nIt was later progressed by Pierre Salinger. Once John F. Kennedy’s press secretary, Salinger misrepresented the post as a document he obtained by someone in French intelligence that originated from a Secret Service agent with U.S. Navy contacts before a CNN reporter pointed out the similarities.\n\nHigh-profile supporters can help build a case for a conspiracy theory, even if their reputations were built in other areas of expertise, Miller said. In this case, Russell said that a longtime friend said he had radar footage that showed a missile traveling toward the plane just prior to the crash.\n\nRussell's message was meant for an inner circle of aviation experts but was leaked online. It ended up a topic of discussion at a Sept. 16 NTSB news briefing on Long Island after media outlets began to investigate.\n\nEasy to blame the government\n\nGovernments are common targets for conspiracy theories, according to Goertzel. They offer someone tangible to blame for unfortunate events, are often disliked and rarely give immediate, comprehensive or definitive answers. Even when government officials respond with emphatic denials, distrust is common.\n\n“A common rhetorical device of conspiracy theorists ... is to advance speculations and then criticize the authorities for not definitively refuting them,” Goertzel said. “They also rely on an inherently implausible claim of a coverup by government agencies that don't really have a very good record of covering things up.”\n\nRussell followed up his claim with a radar tape he said amounted to proof of a rocket strike. Again, Salinger progressed the claim. Ultimately, NTSB officials determined the alleged evidence was a “ghost” signal produced by another jet airplane.\n\nThe personal investment involved in accepting or progressing conspiracy theories can make them tough to dismiss, Barkun said. Corroborating evidence is nice but not necessary. Moreover, contrary evidence can easily be dismissed as another stage in the alleged conspiracy's coverup.\n\n“The conspiracy theory then becomes a closed system,” Barkun said. “There's no way to disprove it.”\n\nTWA Flight 800 investigation\n\nDuring the NTSB's four-year investigation, federal officials obtained signed certifications from U.S. military chains of command running crash area assets, training exercises and armaments capable of reaching the aircraft. They also essentially pieced 95% of the plane back together over a 30-month span.\n\nPurported evidence of a missile strike dried up. CIA analysts determined the Linda Kabot photo of a missile in flight was taken from the opposite direction and featured an airplane flying the opposite way. Another photo that appeared to show an object near the airplane showed debris on the film surface, FBI officials said.\n\nThe airplane’s oddly stained upholstery brought to light by TWA’s chief 747 pilot Robert Terrell Stacey also proved to have a less than salacious origin. Once subjected to microscopic and chemical examination, federal investigators found the red flaky residue was from contact adhesive used to stick the upholstery to its foam base, not rocket fuel.\n\nNTSB officials said any internal speculation into bomb and missile theories dried up within months. Michael Marx, a former metallurgist with the NTSB said FBI personnel unreasonably pushed the sabotage theories, even after a January 1997 ATF report pegged the cause as a mechanical failure.\n\n“By the fall of 1996, in looking at all of the physical evidence and not seeing any evidence of any bomb or missile damage, it became unreasonable to continue to push that theory,” he said during a May 1999 congressional hearing.\n\nStill, doubt lingered. Henry Hughes, a senior accident investigator with the NTSB, was among the group that in 2013 unsuccessfully petitioned the NTSB to re-investigate the crash.\n\nDuring the investigation, FBI officials demanded full control over photographs and were inconsistently inventorying, handling and analyzing aircraft components, NTSB officials said. Meanwhile, the NTSB's assessment overlooked evidence of a missile strike, such as radar data, witness statements and holes in the fuselage, according to Hughes.\n\nAsk the Captain:The unnecessary mystery of EgyptAir 804\n\nThe finger-pointing and varying interpretations of the data between officials at the federal agencies added to the uncertainty, Miller said. Combined with concurrent reporting about real government experiments and other real conspiracies, a tone had been set, he added.\n\n“They really did create a perception that nobody had a clue of what had happened,” Miller said.\n\nWhat really happened to Flight TWA 800?\n\nUltimately, NTSB officials proved that an electrical short could have sparked flammable vapor trapped in a nearly empty fuel tank and concluded that was the likely cause of Flight 800's demise.\n\nThe finding led to regulations requiring a system that pumps inert gas into fuel tanks as they empty. They also spurred the aircraft producer, Boeing, to replace the brittle old wiring on other 747s and redesign their air conditioning packs.\n\nStill, investigators seemed to have difficulty finding a definitive answer for the trails of light witnesses claimed to see near the plane, Miller said. As long as there is ambiguity surrounding the crash, conspiracy theories will remain, Barkun said.\n\nOther potential causes introduced in late 1990 persist along with the friendly-fire claim more than two decades later. One alleged the plane may have been struck by fragments of a meteor that broke up as it entered the Earth’s atmosphere. Another, from Harvard professor Elaine Scarry, claimed electromagnetic interference from a nearby U.S. Navy aircraft triggered the explosion.\n\nPeople have an innate desire to explain evil and misfortune, Barkun said. They also have an aversion to the idea that the world is random — even if that means there is some evil force creating the order, he added.\n\n“Conspiracy theories never die,” Barkun said. “There's no way really to test them.”\n\nFollow reporter David Zimmer on Twitter: @dzimmernews\n\nInvestigations:Massage schools across the US are suspected of ties to prostitution and selling fake diplomas.

This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays,” the chief executives wrote.\n\nThis is because “dozens” of large airports with “buffer zones” designed to limit 5G interference with aircraft would still be subject to flight restrictions announced by the Federal Aviation Administration last week (FAA), said Sky News.\n\nHow could 5G disrupt US flights?\n\n5G, the latest generation of mobile internet connection, relies on “greater use of radio signals” explained the BBC. In the US, the radio signals being used for 5G are part of a spectrum known as C-Band.\n\nThe frequencies 5G will be using is close to the ones used by radio altimeters on aeroplanes, which are used to “measure the height of the aircraft above the ground, and also provide data for safety and navigation systems”, said the broadcaster.\n\nAirlines are concerned that interference from 5G transmissions could stop altimeters from working properly, ultimately causing safety issues “particularly when aircraft are coming in to land”.\n\nHow big is the risk?\n\nIn 2020, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates commercial use of the radio spectrum in the United States, studied the question of whether 5G transmitters near airports would interfere with rada altimeters, and concluded “the two systems could work together,” reported The Economist.", "authors": ["The Week"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/05/30/colorado-missing-toddler-jaryd-atadero-poudre-canyon-mountain-lion-disappearance-mystery/3708176002/", "title": "Jaryd Atadero, missing toddler from Poudre Canyon, a haunting story", "text": "Allyn Atadero emerged from the closet of a basement bedroom decked out in a Poudre River Resort theme, a nod to the place he once owned that now harbors happiness and immense heartache.\n\nTears welled up as he pulled a toy tank, Oakland Raiders hat, Star Wars toy and the top of his son's skull from a white cardboard box.\n\n\"I know it seems weird and some people might not understand, but this is all I have of him,'' said Allyn, now 61, as he pulled the skull fragment from a clear plastic bag. \"It’s sad, kind of surreal to think that this is my son.''\n\nTwenty years ago, Allyn Atadero experienced a parent's worst fear when his 3-year-old son, Jaryd, went missing while hiking with a group on the Big South Trail in the Roosevelt National Forest, 60 miles west of Fort Collins.\n\nThe perplexing events surrounding Jaryd's Oct. 2, 1999, disappearance set off one of the largest search-and-rescue missions in Larimer County history. The case garnered national and international headlines that created a cult-like following of a mystery that has haunted Allyn for much of the past 20 years.\n\nAdding to the case’s intrigue was the crash of a search helicopter, disappearance theories ranging from a mountain lion attack to abduction to drowning in the Big South River — each with its own holes — and a slew of reported sightings of Jaryd from around the country.\n\nThen, on June 4, 2003, two hikers from Fort Collins stumbled upon what 200-plus trained searchers, a water dive team, a dozen dog teams, professional trackers and a search plane couldn’t — Jaryd Atadero, or what remained of him.\n\nThis is the story of one of Colorado’s most infamous unsolved mysteries. It’s an emotional story with waves of heartache, frustration and false hope felt by family, law enforcement and search and rescue staff. It’s a story of a grieving father who, 20 years later, is filled with forgiveness and a tepid peace.\n\n\"I tell people Jaryd is kind of like having a pebble in your shoe,'' Allyn said during an interview at his home in Parker earlier this May. “You know it’s there; every time you take a step you feel it. You can’t do anything about it, but it’s not enough to stop you from doing what you need to do every day. That’s Jaryd.\n\n\"He’s my little pebble.''\n\n‘They lost my baby, they lost my baby’\n\nSaturday, Oct. 2, 1999, was one of those gorgeous fall bluebird days in the mountains of Colorado, and Allyn Atadero and his children, Jaryd and 6-year-old Josallyn, were in the heart of the beauty at the Poudre River Resort owned by Allyn and his twin brother, Arlyn.\n\nThe kids were anxious to go on an excursion to the nearby state fish hatchery with members of the Christian Singles Network group, of which Allyn, who was divorced from the children's mother, was a member.\n\nAllyn was reluctant for Jaryd to go, but when the group said they would only be going to the hatchery, he consented. But from there, the 11 members of the Christian group plus Josallyn and Jaryd decided to take an early afternoon hike up the Big South Trail, 15 miles west of the resort.\n\nThough reports vary on what happened next, it is generally believed the group split into faster- and slower-paced groups on the 11-mile trail, located at 8,440 feet in the rugged Comanche Peak Wilderness and that eventually crosses into Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nAbout 1.5 miles up the trail, Jaryd ran ahead of the group he was with and talked to two fishermen, who didn’t think much about Jaryd being alone since they told investigators they saw a group about 50 to 80 feet down the trail, according to a Larimer County Search and Rescue report. The last the fishermen saw of Jaryd, he was walking rapidly up the trail adjacent to the \"Camp 2\" sign, indicating the second of 16 backcountry campsites along the trail.\n\nIt is unclear if Jaryd was between the two groups or ahead of the faster group when he met the fishermen, who are believed to be the last to see Jaryd before he disappeared.\n\nSome members of the 11-person hiking party reported hearing a scream, according to the investigation report. Josallyn told Allyn she did, too.\n\n\"I asked her, 'What kind of scream was it?'; like somebody getting attacked or somebody playing with someone,\" he said. \"She said it sounded like a playful scream, like someone was going up to tag him.\"\n\nAfter realizing Jaryd was missing and searching for him for about an hour, two members of the group returned to the resort to tell Allyn.\n\n\"They said, 'you need to sit down, something happened to Jaryd,'\" Allyn recalled. \"I asked them, 'What happened to Jaryd?' — thinking he fell down and got hurt. They said, 'He’s OK, we just can’t find him.' ''\n\nAllyn jumped in his vehicle and drove to the trailhead, screaming, \"They lost my baby, they lost my baby,\" and \"beating my chest all the way up there.\"\n\nHe ran up the trail but quickly discovered he wasn’t going to find Jaryd by himself. By the time Allyn returned to the trailhead to have his resort manager call the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office, the manager already had.\n\nA sheriff's deputy and a Larimer County Search and Rescue member arrived, followed by more of each.\n\nJosallyn, who is now married and lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said she doesn’t have many vivid memories of the events but does remember her father returning from the trail without Jaryd.\n\n\"One of those memories was at the resort and hugging my dad, who was kneeling or squatting and crying and then wrapping my arms around him because I realized how serious this was,'' she said.\n\nBill Nelson, now a recently retired undersheriff with the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office, was in charge of the search for Jaryd. When searchers arrived, it appeared to be just another mission, he said in a recent interview.\n\n\"Absolutely, I thought we would find him,''’ he said. \"Yes, it was a young child, but my thought was we should be able to get in there with our people and do what we do and what we have done hundreds of times: find the person. It might take a few hours to find the child crying or hiding someplace nearby, but we would be done before midnight.''\n\nNelson said he went to his vehicle to nap just before midnight and told his staff to wake him when they found the boy. When he awoke the next morning in the front seat of his pickup, he became concerned.\n\nThe search for Jaryd hadn't gone as planned. Nor would it.\n\nHelicopter down\n\nSunday morning, Allyn and Josallyn heard the \"whop, whop, whop'' of a search helicopter making its way up the canyon.\n\n\"I remember saying to Josallyn, 'Look, there’s the helicopter, they are going to find your brother,' and we watched it fly over us,'' Allyn said.\n\nInstead of searching for Jaryd on that flight, the Huey UH-1N helicopter from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo., flew to what was then the Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport to refuel.\n\nWhen the helicopter returned, it struggled with the fuel load and mountain conditions and stalled out, falling 100 feet and crashing up the Big South Trail. Aboard were four members of the Air Force and Mark Sheets, a Loveland resident and Larimer County Search and Rescue member.\n\nSheets wasn’t supposed to be on the flight but had relieved his manager, George Janson, from his shift. Janson suggested Sheets fly with the crew to help the team make ground search plans.\n\nSheets, 57, who retired from Larimer County Search and Rescue in 2017 after 30 years, remembers the moment before impact.\n\n\"I said on the intercom that we needed altitude now and (remember) the co-pilot saying, 'I know but I can’t. We are going in,'\" he said. \"To me that was code for brace for impact.\"\n\nSheets was the only crew member not in a seat — he was on the floor with the door open. He saw the rotors hit the tops of trees and pieces of helicopter spray into the forest. He tried to shut the door, but a severed tree limb came through and struck the Air Force doctor on board, fracturing the doctor's eye socket.\n\nSheets said the helicopter continued to disintegrate — the fuselage split into three pieces — as it crashed across the trail. The jet engines, still operational, would roar for hours until the fuel ran out.\n\nThe Air Force crew was able to get out of the helicopter, Sheets said, but he was trapped. Nearby search and rescue members ran to the downed helicopter, kicked in a window and managed to pull the unconscious Sheets out.\n\nSheets, who skipped wearing a helmet so he could wear a headset to communicate with the pilot, suffered a severe concussion and a 13-inch, L-shaped gash that left his femur exposed. He also suffered three broken vertebrae in his lower back and a broken shoulder, he presumes from being pulled from the wreckage.\n\nHe spent three days at Poudre Valley Hospital, where he impatiently waited for word about the search for Jaryd.\n\n\"That made me angry because I wanted to be out there doing something useful,'' he said.\n\nCurrent Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith was a sergeant with the department during the search, for which he was the public information officer. He said the crash added to the stress of a search that only grew more frustrating as the national media took notice.\n\nTV trucks and newspaper reporters began to swarm the remote site after the grand jury in another chilling child case — the death of JonBenet Ramsay in Boulder — postponed its announcement of whether it would hand down indictments.\n\nThe perfect storm was brewing.\n\n\"I remember from moment one that second day, we quickly realized what we were up against,'' Smith said. \"We had searchers down who they were bringing out on stretchers, we had a missing kid overnight, we had the Air Force closing off the crash site. Emotionally it was overwhelming, and you could see it in the eyes of everybody involved.\"\n\nTV satellite trucks — 17 at one time — lined up along Colorado Highway 14 with \"anchors in fur coats walking around and anybody and everybody calling us for information,'' Smith said.\n\nThe disappearance of Jaryd Atadero had become an international spectacle.\n\n‘Daddy, if he's not alive, God has him’\n\nAs the search stretched into the third day, searchers combed river banks and up steep slopes. Dive teams peered into small pools left in the narrow, slow-moving river. A plane made passes overhead.\n\nWith every intense hour that searchers came up empty, the crush of questions squeezed law enforcement and searchers even harder.\n\nWell-meaning but ill-equipped people were increasingly hounding the Larimer County Sheriff's Office and Larimer County Search and Rescue to allow them to help.\n\nPsychics professed to know where searchers could find Jaryd. A bare-footed man with a mule showed up at the search site, ready to track him down. An American Indian came to perform a ritual, asking the mountain to give up the boy.\n\nTheories as to what happened to Jaryd were expanding from rational possibilities — killed by a predator, fell behind boulders and died, drowned in the river — to the less plausible, but still possible, theory of abduction, to strange conspiracy theories.\n\nA variety of people were voicing those theories to a vulnerable Allyn and his family, creating growing tension between the family and searchers.\n\n\"It became a tornado, hurricane, biggest storm in all of our lives,'' Allyn said. \"I was critical of them at the time because when you are in a survival situation, you want everything that can be done to be done, and at times I thought there was so much more they could have done.''\n\nNelson said things became so tense between the family and searchers that he had to take Allyn and his family for a hike up the trail to hash things out.\n\n\"Allyn and his family were certain that Jaryd had been abducted because we couldn’t find him,\" Nelson said. \"I might have felt the same way if it was my son, but we knew abduction was slim.''\n\nIt was the theory that, despite long odds, was gaining traction.\n\nBut who could have abducted Jaryd?\n\nInvestigators questioned everyone from Allyn to members of the Christian singles group to the fishermen who were presumably the last to see Jaryd. They talked to Allyn’s ex-wife, who was living in San Diego and came to Colorado after hearing Jaryd was lost.\n\nNo red flags.\n\n\"There were people who wanted to point to the abduction conspiracy theory but nothing ever fell in line with it,'' Smith said. \"How could you capture this kid in the woods in this short time frame and then have gotten out without anybody seeing you? It just wasn’t probable.''\n\nThere is only one easy way out of the narrow canyon — back down the trail. On the day of Jaryd's disappearance, one of the first searchers quickly hiked up to where snow covered the trail and saw no tracks. Hiking out either side of the narrow canyon would require a climb of 1,000 to nearly 2,000 vertical feet through thick trees and downed logs on a 45-degree slope.\n\nAs the search continued with no signs of Jaryd, the mountain lion attack theory became officials' prevailing thought. There were mountain lion prints found in the area but nothing conclusive to indicate Jaryd might have been killed along the trail.\n\nBut an 18-year-old man was killed by a mountain lion near Idaho Springs in 1991, and a 10-year-old boy was killed by a lion in 1997 in nearby Rocky Mountain National Park. Wildlife experts said it wouldn’t take much for a mountain lion to carry a 3-year-old boy off the trail.\n\nWith Jaryd's trail growing colder, the sheriff's office met with Allyn and his family and made the difficult decision to call off the official search after a week. Others were allowed to continue the search on their own.\n\n\"I remember that Saturday after they called off the search going to Jaryd’s closet and putting away his dirty clothes and picking up the tank and toy soldiers from the bathtub where, the day before he went missing, he took a bath,'' Allyn said. \"I realized then I would never see him again. I had his toys but I didn't have my baby.''\n\nGone was Allyn falling asleep nightly with Jaryd holding his hand. Gone was the weekly ritual where Allyn, Josallyn and Jared would stand together holding hands, raising them up as Allyn declared, \"This is who you can count on for the rest of your life.''\n\nGuilt, loneliness and frustration ate at Allyn in the apartment the three shared in Littleton, where Allyn was teaching. Josallyn came to the rescue.\n\n\"Looking back, Josallyn was always there for me, but I wasn’t always there for her,'' Allyn said. \"She was always putting her arms around me after Jaryd was gone. One day she asked me if Jaryd was bothering me and I said, 'Yes.'\n\n\"Her response was, 'Daddy there are only two things that could happen to Jaryd: Somebody has him and he is alive. If he’s not alive, God has him, so why are you worried?'\"\n\nMiracle on the mountain\n\nWhile the search for Jaryd faded, hoaxes continued to haunt Allyn for years.\n\nA Fort Collins woman was charged for repeatedly and falsely claiming she knew a woman who abducted Jaryd. Reports of Jaryd being seen alive ranged from coast to coast. And earlier this May, a California man who for years has claimed to be Jaryd — though DNA tests have shown otherwise — was arrested in Douglas County near where Allyn lives for violating a restraining order against him.\n\n\"For many, many years, a door would open that would lead to another door that would lead to another door,'' said Deborah Atadero, Allyn’s wife of 16 years. \"It was just exhausting, hoping the next door is going to be the answer, the next person is going to help, that next we would find out exactly what happened to Jaryd.''\n\nAnd then they did. Or, at least, they found more breadcrumbs.\n\nOn June 4, 2003, Fort Collins businessmen and hiking partners Gary Watts and Rob Osborne were hiking off-trail in the Big South Trail area when they stumbled upon a white Tarzan tennis shoe in a talus slope 500 vertical feet above the trail.\n\nThen they found the other shoe, a brown fleece jacket and blue sweatpants turned inside out. One pant leg was mostly scattered by birds using the material in their nests.\n\nWatts and Osborne knew instantly who they had discovered.\n\n\"The thing is, we were up there a week earlier and talked quite a bit about the various scenarios about his disappearance,'' said Osborne, owner of Avogadro’s Number restaurant and bar in Fort Collins. \"Then we happened upon the clothes, and it’s mystery solved.\n\n\"Once we saw the clothes, I knew exactly what happened to him; a mountain lion killed him. We felt that finding the items would hopefully bring some closure to the family.''\n\nThey photographed the area and clothing as they found them, turned a bread bag inside out and took the fleece jacket and a shoe with them to the sheriff’s office the next day, as they didn’t return to Fort Collins until late that evening.\n\nThe next day, it took searchers about an hour to reach the site near Campsite 2, where they found the remaining clothing scattered across a 25-foot area. Some of the items were sheltered from the elements and some were exposed.\n\nWhile the cloth jacket had what appeared to be puncture marks and the pants were tattered, the nylon shoes had little weathering. Eleven days later — just before Father's Day — searchers found a molar and skull cap.\n\n\"One of our members was walking and about to step on a shrub when a member just below them saw the skull under the shrub,'' said Don Davis, a search and rescue member involved with the search. \"I remember Allyn being up there with us. He asked if he could hold his son’s skull, and it was a very sad situation.''\n\nInitial DNA tests found an 86% chance the remains were Jaryd, Allyn said. It wasn’t until a decade later that new DNA technology proved 100% they were Jaryd's remains.\n\n\"Once you hear that, all hope of him being alive or somewhere else all goes right out with that,\" Allyn said of the confirmation.\n\nAccording to Larimer County Search and Rescue's report, searchers on foot had never made it up to the 9,120 foot elevation at Jaryd's skull and tooth were found. The Air Force helicopter would have likely searched the area had it not crashed.\n\nAdditional tests by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, including for blood and hair on the clothing the hikers found, revealed little about what killed Jaryd. His death certificate indicates the manner of death as \"undetermined, probable mountain lion attack.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure we will ever know 100%, but at this point in my life I'm not sure it matters,'' Allyn said.\n\n‘Wish you were here’\n\nJaryd has been gone in body for 20 years, but not in spirit.\n\nAllyn, Deborah and family members celebrate Jaryd’s birthday — Jan. 2, 1996 — every year with a cake.\n\n\"We sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to him each year, and each year Allyn barely gets out the first two words when he starts crying,'' Deborah said. \"But we believe it’s important to honor him.''\n\nWhen Josallyn got married last summer, they had a seat for Jaryd at the reception, adorned with his beloved Raiders hat. A month before the wedding, Allyn hiked up to the spot where they found Jaryd's remains and left a wedding invitation for him.\n\nAnd then there is the Pink Floyd song, \"Wish You Were Here.\" It was Allyn's and Jaryd’s song, he said, and it plays on the radio just when he needs to be reminded of his son.\n\n\"On Oct. 2 of last year, I got into my car and was backing out of the driveway when our song came on the radio,'' Allyn said. \"That made me smile''\n\nAllyn, who retired Tuesday as a physical education teacher at Falcon Bluffs Middle School in Ken Caryl, said it’s those little reminders and a strong Christian faith that comfort him now.\n\n\"I know I will see him again one day,'' he said. \"When I do, I’m going to walk up to him and say, 'Jaryd, so tell me what happened.' And he’s going to look at me and say, 'Dad does it really matter?'\"\n\nArlyn, Allyn’s twin brother and a retired school administrator who lives in Fort Collins, said he has slowly seen his brother work through the dark times to a place not of closure, but contentment.\n\n\"For years, I looked at him and saw dead man walking,'' Arlyn said. \"People talk about the worst thing a parent can go through, and I had a front-row seat for it and it was a horrible thing to watch. But I definitely see him at peace now.''\n\nJosallyn said she, too, has noticed her father has healed, but she knows \"what could have been\" remains that pebble in both of their shoes.\n\n\"We will probably never know exactly what happened to Jaryd, but we are at some kind of peace with that,'' she said. \"Still, you think about all the things you missed out on in those 20 years, and it makes me miss him even more.''\n\nNelson and Smith said they have come as close to peace with the case as they can get. It’s not complete peace because of the outcome, but they feel they did all they could to find Jaryd alive. Both believe Jaryd was killed quickly by a mountain lion before they were even called.\n\n\"I have no drive to try and change somebody’s mind of what happened,'' Smith said. \"We are 95% or 99% sure what happened to Jaryd. What I do know is that I can go to a (Search and Rescue) meeting today and bring up Jaryd Atadero’s name and there will be tears. They all wanted a different outcome, and it is something these people will take to their graves.''\n\nAllyn and Deborah have rallied for a number of initiatives to help fund search and rescue teams since Jaryd's death. And those hard feelings during the search have faded to admiration for the difficult tasks of law enforcement and searchers.\n\n\"Back then we all started in different spots up there on that mountain,'' said Allyn, rubbing the top of Jaryd's skull. \"Today, it’s about where we finished. We can all start in different spots and still finish in the same spot. I need to give all those people a hug because they are God’s angels.\n\n\"I always tell people pain is a direct reflection of love. The more you love something, the more it’s going to hurt. My hurt was intense because my love for Jaryd was intense. But there comes a point when you look back and say the best part of the world is the peace that we have. There is nothing more important than having peace and joy in your life. And I finally feel that peace.''\n\nMore:Podpast: Family speaks about the disappearance of Chris Vigil\n\nTimeline: The disappearance of Jaryd Atadero\n\nThis timeline was compiled from Larimer County Search and Rescue's investigation report.\n\nOct 2, 1999\n\n10 a.m.: Three-year-old Jaryd Atadero, his 6-year-old sister, Josallyn Atadero, and 11 members of the Christian Singles Network leave the Poudre River Resort, owned by the children’s father, Allyn Atadero, for a hike on the Big South Trail, 15 miles west of the resort and 60 miles west of Fort Collins.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Two fishermen talk to Jaryd near the Camp 2 site and see hikers from a group 50 to 80 feet away.

And he “hinted that he would make a third presidential run” in 2024, the paper adds.\n\n“Our movement is far from over,” Trump told the North Carolina Republican Party’s convention. “In fact, it is just getting started.”\n\nIn a bid to “galvanise supporters ahead of next year's elections for the Senate and House of Representatives”, Trump “hailed his administration’s achievements” and launched “typically colourful attacks on opponents foreign and domestic”, says The Telegraph.\n\nThe former president attacked Dr Anthony Fauci’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing the White House’s most senior scientific adviser as “not a great doctor but a great promoter”.\n\n“He’s been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong on Wuhan and the lab also,” Trump added, in a nod to theories that the coronavirus came from a research facility in the Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak.\n\n“We demand reparations from the Communist Party of China,” said Trump, who told the Republican convention that the Asian superpower should pay $10tr (£7tr) in “reparations”.\n\nHe also called for the US to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and urged other countries to repudiate their debts to Beijing as a “down payment” for the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\nPredictably, Trump blasted Joe Biden too, claiming that the Democrat is leading “the most radical left-wing administration in history”.\n\n“All Joe Biden had to do was sit back and do nothing - it was taking off like a rocket ship nobody's ever seen,” Trump said. “Instead, the economy is going to hell and inflation is going to cause a catastrophe in the near future.”\n\nThe speech marked Trump's first political appearance outside his home state of Florida since leaving the White House, and in contrast to “the mega-rallies he hosted during his presidency”, was attended by only about 1,200 people, The Telegraph reports.\n\nBut despite being “a diminished public figure after losing office and being blocked by both Twitter and Facebook”, says The Times, Trump “retains a grip on Republican politics” and is the “front runner for the party’s presidential nomination in 2024 in every survey”.\n\nAll the same, while the convention crowd applauded the ex-president’s inflammatory comments, internet chat focused on footage from the event which appeared to show that Trump's trousers were “oddly wrinkled around the front thighs, with no visible fly”, says the Daily Mail.\n\nSome critics claimed that he had “put his pants on backwards”, while others suggested that the trousers “might be elastic-waisted pull-ups with no button or front zipper”, the paper reports.\n\n.", "authors": ["Joe Evans"], "publish_date": "2021/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/956634/what-does-war-ukraine-mean-donald-trump-2024-ambitions", "title": "How the Ukraine war may affect Donald Trump's 2024 hopes | The ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

There was growing interest among members of Congress, who called for greater transparency on the issue. The Senate’s intelligence committee demanded that the Pentagon – the Department of Defence – release a public report describing its findings.\n\nWhat were these widely reported incidents?\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, US navy pilots from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt described close encounters in the Atlantic off Virginia with what looked like flying spheres.\n\nPilots reported that the objects had no visible engine or exhaust plumes, but that they could reach altitudes of 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds. Some incidents were videotaped, including one in early 2015 that shows an object zooming over the waves as a pilot exclaims: “Wow, what is that, man? Look at it fly!”\n\nIn November 2004, two jets from the USS Nimitz were 100 miles southwest of San Diego when they encountered a white oval-shaped craft hovering above the sea. As one of the F-18 jets descended to look, the object ascended towards it, then zipped away. “It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen,” said David Fravor, one of the pilots. “It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.”\n\nWhat did the report find?\n\nThe Pentagon examined 144 reports of UAPs made by US military pilots between 2004 and 2021. Although only nine pages long, it presents some interesting findings. One is that UAPs “probably do represent physical objects”, as opposed to technical anomalies or figments of pilots’ imaginations. Some 80 of the UAPs were observed with “multiple sensors”, for instance by radar, infrared and optical cameras as well as pilots’ visual observations.\n\nFurthermore, in 18 of the incidents, the objects demonstrated “unusual flight characteristics”, such as manoeuvring abruptly or moving at intense speeds – potentially demonstrating advanced, as-yet unknown technologies. The report also identified 11 “near-misses” between UAPs and US pilots, concluding that they “clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to US national security”.\n\nDid it offer explanations?\n\nBy and large, no. In one case, the Pentagon felt confident that the reported sighting of a UAP was in fact “a large, deflating balloon”. As for the other 143 sightings, it said it was unable to explain them definitively. But it did put forward five potential categories for sightings of UAPs: first, “airborne clutter”, such as birds, drones, balloons or debris; second, “natural atmospheric phenomena” such as thermal fluctuations, ball lightning or solar flares; third, classified technology operated by “US entities”; fourth, “foreign adversary systems”, i.e. secret technologies deployed by China or Russia; fifth, a catch-all “other”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week UK", "text": "Arise, Sir Tony Blair: 14 years after leaving Downing Street, the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair is controversially knighted in the New Year Honours list.\n\nAs Moscow builds up its troop deployments near the Ukrainian border, Joe Biden warns Vladimir Putin that the US will respond “decisively” if Russia invades.\n\nA jury acquits the defendants known as “the Colston Four” (pictured) of criminal damage, for their part in toppling a statue of the 17th century slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston in 2020, and tipping it into the harbour in Bristol.\n\nDuring an audience at the Vatican, the Pontiff castigates couples who “substitute cats and dogs for children”, saying “renouncing parenthood diminishes us.

The Republican governor of Florida – who is up for re-election in November and is considering a White House run – staged an appalling “stunt” last week, flying two planeloads of illegal migrants, mostly from Venezuela, to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard, a favourite summer haunt of well-to-do liberals.\n\nHe got the idea from the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who has ferried thousands of migrants to Washington DC, New York and Chicago. These are all so-called “sanctuary cities”, which pride themselves on welcoming immigrants and protecting them from deportation.\n\nAbbott’s line is that his state is so overwhelmed with immigrants that he needs to send them to the places that are attracting them. Florida, of course, has no border with Mexico, but that didn’t stop DeSantis. He just got some migrants from Texas, and “exploited” them for “political gain”.\n\nLiberals are aghast at DeSantis’s move, said Jordan Boyd in The Federalist. They’ve branded it “evil”. But the “real cruelty”, of course, is that Joe Biden’s policies have allowed the border crisis to get so out of control. At least 650 migrants died last year trying to cross the border, and hundreds more have died this year.\n\nBorder states, meanwhile, are struggling to absorb the vast number of arrivals from Mexico: two million are set to enter the US this year. By eradicating the “Remain in Mexico” rule, which required asylum seekers to await court decisions in Mexico, and ending other border-control measures, Biden invited a dangerous surge in illegal crossings. “If dropping migrants at the doorstep of the rich” forces Democrats to reckon with the polices that caused the crisis, “then so be it”.\n\nBorder states have every reason to be fed up with America’s immigration system, said Rex Huppke in USA Today. It’s “a mess”. But Republicans won’t help solve this by scooping up desperate migrants – including families with young children – and dumping them in cities run by people they don’t like.\n\nThe same tactic was employed by southern segregationists in the 1960s. Annoyed by activists from northern states advocating integration, they lured black citizens onto buses with promises of jobs and dumped them in northern cities. “Americans at that time saw it as a callous ploy, and it fizzled into infamy. The same will happen with this modern-day version.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}]}

She also directed several films, the documentary \"An American Heroine,\" which never got distribution, and \"The Ranch.\" She retired in 2010.\n\nIn an interview in 1994, Stevens said that she worried that she didn't succeed in bringing out the best in her directors and that her ambitions changed.\n\n\"I wanted to be like my favorite actresses: Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. I wanted to be like a burst of youth and then when I got a little crow's feet or age, I'd be off the screen,\" she said.\" But I also had the plan of being a director ...

The FDA usually follows its advisory committee's recommendation but is not obligated to do so. The federal agency is expected to decide by March 29.\n\nWhy is retail Narcan important?\n\nAll states have standing orders that allow a person to get naloxone from a pharmacist without a doctor’s prescription, but consumers must approach a pharmacist and ask for the medication before purchasing.\n\nDr. Bobby Mukkamala, chair of the American Medical Association's substance use and pain care task force, said a retail version of the drug would make it easier for people to access.\n\n“Making naloxone over the counter is a safe and vital step to ending the nation’s overdose epidemic,\" Mukkamala said. “Individuals should be able to pick up a package of naloxone without having to face the potential stigma or shame of having to ask for this life-saving medication.\"\n\nWhen will the drug be available for purchase?\n\nEmergent Biosolutions has not said how soon the drug might be available or how much it will cost if the FDA approves retail sales.\n\nNarcan and its generic version, naloxone, is widely distributed by community organizations that seek to slow the nation's spiraling overdose epidemic.

The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was scheduled to meet February 15 to go over data from vaccine trials and make a recommendation on whether a two-dose vaccine regimen should be authorized.\n\nBut the FDA announced Friday that it had postponed the meeting because “new data have recently emerged.”\n\nThe data supported the safety of the vaccines but showed disappointing effectiveness, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n\nThe agency needs to see data from an ongoing trial of a third vaccine dose in these younger children in order to move forward with emergency use authorization, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech said Friday that they expect to have data on three doses available in early April.\n\nInformation came in “so rapidly” during the Omicron wave “that at this time, it makes sense for us to wait until we have the data from the evaluation of a third dose before taking action,” Marks said.\n\n“The data that we saw made us realize that we needed to see data from a third dose as in the ongoing trial in order to make the determination that we could proceed with doing an authorization.”\n\nThe delay is a sharp change of pace.\n\nThere are about 18 million children ages 6 months through 4 years in the United States who would be eligible for the vaccine. Jeff Zients, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, said Wednesday that planning was well underway to roll out vaccines, needles and syringes as soon as the FDA made an authorization decision. A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention planning document posted online had said deliveries could begin as soon as February 21.\n\nWinding path to authorization\n\nIn December, Pfizer said that the vaccine appeared to protect the youngest children – infants and toddlers up to 2 – at the same levels seen in teens and young adults, slashing symptoms in 90% of kids who got the shot. However, the 3-microgram dose did not produce the same immune response in 2- to 5-year-olds.\n\nThe dose for infants and young children is about one-third of the dose given to children age 5 to 11 and a tenth the size of the dose given to people 12 and older.\n\nAt the time, the company decided to expand its trial to include a third dose, rather than the two doses older children and adults receive in a primary vaccine series.\n\nBut high rates of infection and illness among children from the Omicron variant have allowed the company to quickly accumulate trial data. At the start of February, while it continued to investigate a third dose, the company said it had decided to submit for authorization of the two-dose vaccine “with pediatric Covid-19 cases surpassing 10 million and at the request of the FDA.”\n\nIn a news release Friday, Pfizer said it continues to share data from its child vaccine trial with the FDA.\n\n“Given that the study is advancing at a rapid pace, the companies will wait for the three-dose data as Pfizer and BioNTech continue to believe it may provide a higher level of protection in this age group,” Pfizer’s news release said. “This is also supported by recent observations of three dose booster data in several other age groups that seems to meaningfully augment neutralizing antibody levels and real world vaccine protection for omicron compared to the two-dose regimen.”\n\nPfizer said the study’s independent data monitoring committee supports the continuation of the trial. It believes that the data collected indicates that the vaccine is well-tolerated and supports a potential three-dose regimen.\n\nAfter the FDA postponed the meeting of its vaccine advisers, Marks said it’s important for the agency to stay nimble in the face of a quickly pandemic.\n\n“What we’re dealing with is taking the approach that we very much should take as a public health agency, which is to constantly take in the data that come to us and adjust to that,” Marks said. “So what we’re doing now is adjusting to this, and yes, some of this was late-breaking, but that’s what our job is, it’s to adjust to it.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA vaccine committee, said he is glad things played out this way.\n\nIf the committee had met on Tuesday and voted no, “that would have sent the message to the general public that something’s wrong with this vaccine. And then [if] we come back a few months later and vote yes, people may still be suspicious or less likely to take the vaccine up,” he said.\n\n“My word to parents who have young children is that this is not a ‘no’; it’s a ‘not yet,’ ” he added.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that with cases and hospitalizations going down across the country, there is a little more breathing room to look at the data and determine the right vaccine schedule up-front.\n\n“Let’s take a step back and take a deep breath. When we recommend ‘should we do vaccines for all children aged 6 months to 4 years of age,’ we want to be able to communicate to the parents exactly what they can expect regarding effectiveness and safety,” said Schaffner, a vaccine advisers to the CDC. “If that takes us a few more days to secure those data, analyze them, think about them and then present them, let’s take a few more days, because we want to be able to do this in the best possible way we can.”\n\nFDA says it will move as fast as it can\n\nThe Covid-19 case load among children has been “extremely high” during the Omicron surge, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. There have been over 7 million child cases reported since September, and more than half of them have come this year.\n\nChildren have a lower risk of serious outcomes from a Covid-19 infection compared with elderly or immunocompromised adults. But about 1% of children who catch Covid-19 will be hospitalized. Infections can also lead to long-term consequences in children as they do in adults, increasing the risk for diabetes, autoimmune disease and a delayed reaction to infection called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which requires hospital care.\n\nDr. Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt, called the decision to delay the meeting “heart-wrenching.”\n\n“I think as a scientist, they’re going to have more data sooner than they thought and that we’ll get to see and analyze and really get to delve into the data that’s coming,” said Talbot, who is a vaccine adviser to the CDC. “But I can imagine parents with kids less than 5 years of age are just so frustrated, and they’re just so ready to have their kids vaccinated.”\n\nMarks said he understands that parents are eager to get protection for their young children, and the agency is “absolutely committed to moving as rapidly as we can once we have a submission.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We take our responsibility for reviewing these vaccines very seriously because we’re parents as well, and in looking over the data, I think parents can feel reassured that we have set a standard by which we feel that if something does not meet that standard, we can’t proceed forward.”\n\nWhile the additional data are gathered, that means “parents will have to rely on what they’ve come to do well, which is they’re using masking procedures, and they’re making sure that they’re vaccinated and taking those types of precautions with their youngest children,” Marks said. “We will do our part, obviously, to move as fast as we can when we have the data, but for now, we’ll have to ask parents to help to continue to do what they’ve been doing.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Brenda Goodman Jamie Gumbrecht", "Jen Christensen", "Brenda Goodman", "Jamie Gumbrecht"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/health/fda-covid-vaccine-youngest-children-vrbpac-vote/index.html", "title": "FDA advisers vote in favor of authorizing Covid-19 vaccines for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously on Wednesday in favor of expanding the emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to include children as young as 6 months.\n\nAll 21 members of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted “yes” in response to the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine when administered as a 2-dose series (25 micrograms each dose) outweigh its risks for use in infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age?”\n\nAnd all the committee members voted yes in response to the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine when administered as a 3-dose series (3 micrograms each dose) outweigh its risks for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years of age?”\n\nThe FDA, which typically follows the committee’s decisions, will now decide whether to authorize the vaccines for emergency use in the youngest children.\n\nHowever, shots can’t be given until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own vaccine advisers have voted on whether to recommend them and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has signed off on the recommendation.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisers are expected to vote Saturday.

About 17 million kids will become eligible for Covid-19 vaccines once they’re authorized for this age group.\n\n“To be able to vote for authorization of two vaccines that will protect children down to 6 months of age against this deadly disease is a very important thing,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nShe compared the day to December 2020, when the first Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for adults and older teens.\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said of the Moderna vaccine.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Art Reingold added that even though the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death is lower for young children than for adults, children already get vaccinations to protect them against diseases for which their risk is low.\n\n“If we have a vaccine with benefits that outweigh the risks, then making it available to people is a reasonable choice,” said Reingold, of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“I would point out that we as a country continue to give a large number of vaccines to children where the risk of the child dying or being hospitalized of those diseases are pretty close to zero,” he said, such as polio and measles.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said at Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” said Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nMarks said the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths.\n\nModerna vaccine ‘well-tolerated’ in youngest children\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is already authorized for adults. In a meeting Tuesday, the FDA’s advisers voted unanimously in favor of expanding the emergency use authorization to include older children and teens, ages 6 to 17, saying it would also offer more benefits than risks.\n\nModerna’s Covid-19 vaccine, when given as a 25-microgram dose, is “well-tolerated” in children ages 6 months to 5, said Dr. Rituparna Das, Moderna’s vice president of Covid-19 vaccines clinical development, during Wednesday’s meeting as she described the safety profile of the vaccine among this age group and adverse reactions.\n\n“Pain was the most common event,” Das said. “Young children’s events included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting and chills. For infants and toddlers, events included fever, irritability, crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite.”\n\nThese reactions were more common after the second dose of vaccine and resolved within two or three days, Das said, adding that fever was an important assessment of the vaccine’s safety for this age group.\n\nFever after any dose of vaccine happened in about a quarter of the children, but more often after the second dose, and one incident of febrile seizure was considered to be related to vaccination, Das told the committee members. The child who had the seizure remained in the vaccine study and got a second dose of vaccine with no serious events.\n\nNo deaths or cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported among vaccine recipients, Das said.\n\n“In summary, mRNA-1273 was well tolerated,” she said, using the technical name of Moderna’s vaccine. “Local and systemic reactions were seen less frequently in these youngest groups.”\n\nConcern over number of doses\n\nVRBPAC member Dr. Paul Offit said in Wednesday’s meeting that children who get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will have to complete a three-dose series to get sufficient protection.\n\n” ‘Do the benefits outweigh the risks’ is something I can support, but I do have some concerns about this vaccine,” said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences also mentioned concern that some children might not complete all three doses and that uptake of the vaccine will be slow.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” she said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nData from a phase 2/3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine included 1,678 children who had received a third dose during the period when the Omicron coronavirus variant dominated. The vaccine appeared to be safe and had a strong immune response. The data has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.\n\nAntibody levels tested one month after the third dose showed that the vaccine produced a similar immune response as two doses in 16- to 25-year-olds, the companies said.\n\nIn FDA briefing documents, it was noted that among young children who had received the vaccine in trials, there were no cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis or pericarditis, and the most common adverse reactions among children 6 months to 23 months were irritability, drowsiness, decreased appetite and tenderness at the injection site. For children 2 to 4 years old, the most common adverse reactions were fatigue and pain and redness at the injection site.\n\nWill these children get vaccinated?\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among children in the United States.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBarouch, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November.

The shot was administered in his thigh. He cried for a few seconds but then his attention turned toward a golden retriever that was on site as a comfort dog provided by the hospital.\n\n“I’m feeling really thrilled that we have this opportunity,” DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told CNN’s Suzanne Malveaux on Tuesday about her son’s vaccination.\n\nDeRoo added that her family now will feel more comfortable participating in certain activities, knowing that their youngest son has started his Covid-19 vaccine series.\n\n“It will certainly allow us to have more freedom with our personal lives and what we do,” DeRoo said. “And for the baby, we’ll feel like we have cloaked him in as much protection as we can.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations for children younger than 5 are beginning Tuesday across the United States, marking a milestone in the nation’s fight against the disease.\n\nLast week, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorizations for Moderna’s vaccine to include children 6 months through 17 years and Pfizer/BioNTech’s for children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nThen on Saturday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on Covid-19 vaccinations for children under 5, clearing the way for vaccinations to be administered in that age group.\n\nAbout 17 million kids under the age of 5 are now eligible for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“This is a big day. We’ve been waiting a long time for children to have access to the vaccine. We now have every age group, 6 months and above, in the country which is now eligible to get protection from the Covid-19 vaccine. And I’ll tell you as a dad of a 4-year-old, this is a big deal for my family as well,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday morning.\n\nAs of the end of Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has delivered approximately 2.7 million doses of vaccine for children under 5 nationwide.\n\n“Another 1 million doses have been shipped and will soon be received by administration sites,” Tim Granholm, an HHS spokesperson, wrote in an email to CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\n“HHS has received orders for approximately 4.2 million doses to date,” Granholm wrote. “We will continue to deliver vaccines expeditiously as we fulfill orders and take new ones. We made 10 million doses of vaccine available for ordering initially, with millions more available soon, so supply should not be a barrier to someone getting their young child vaccinated.”\n\nVaccines given in child-sized doses\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, with doses given four weeks apart, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age.\n\nWhile the FDA has authorized Moderna’s vaccine for children ages 6 to 17, the CDC has not yet recommended it for that age group, so those shots can’t be administered yet. The FDA authorization would allow children ages 6 to 11 to receive doses are 50 micrograms each. For those ages 12 and older, it would be administered as 100-microgram doses.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine now can be given as a three-dose primary series, at 3 micrograms each dose, for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years. The vaccine is administered as a two-dose primary series at 10 micrograms per dose for children 5 to 11 and at 30 micrograms per dose for adolescents and adults ages 12 and older.\n\nCompleting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine series is a longer process, as the first two doses are administered three weeks apart, and then the third dose is given eight weeks later.\n\nDr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who serves on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, expressed concern about children not completing all three doses.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” Lee said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nAs for children who might turn from age 4 to 5 at any point while completing their Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine series, the CDC recommends two options. The child could complete the two-dose primary series authorized for children ages 5 to 11, or they could complete the three-dose series for younger kids, but each of doses 2 and 3 may be either the dosage for younger children or ages 5 to 11.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee determined that the benefits of both vaccines outweigh the risks and noted that the vaccines have been “well-tolerated” among the children who got them in clinical trials.\n\nAccording to clinical trial data, common side effects for both vaccines include pain at the injection site, headache, fever, chills and fatigue. The vaccines appeared to elicit similar immune responses in children as has been seen in adults.\n\nWhere young children can get vaccinated\n\nPediatricians’ offices and pharmacies are the main sites where young children could get vaccinated.\n\n“We know that parents are going to want to get their children vaccinated in pediatricians’ offices. Some people will go to a pharmacy, some people will go to a children’s hospital or some sort of a community health center,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Monday on CBS.\n\n“But the bottom line is, I think a majority of parents are going to want to get their child vaccinated in their pediatrician’s office,” Jha said. “So, many pediatricians are going to be offering the vaccine.”\n\nAs for the pharmacy locations offering these child-sized vaccines, CVS and Walgreens have announced plans to provide vaccinations.\n\nCVS will begin administering Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccines to children under five on Tuesday, a communications representative told CNN.\n\n“We will begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for eligible children 18 months through four years of age at our 1,100 MinuteClinic locations starting on Tuesday,” Matt Blanchette, senior manager of retail communications with CVS Pharmacy, told CNN in an email.\n\n“MinuteClinic is located inside select CVS Pharmacy stores in 35 states and Washington, DC,” Blanchette said. Appointments will be available on a rolling basis according to vaccine supply.\n\nBlanchette said children over 5 will still be able to access Covid-19 vaccines in CVS pharmacies.\n\nOn Saturday, Walgreens announced in a news release that appointments for vaccinations in young children will be available starting June 25. Walgreens will be vaccinating children 3 and older at “select” locations, and appointments can be scheduled online.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHy-Vee pharmacies will have Covid-19 vaccinations available for children under 5 once doses are available, a communications representative told CNN on Monday.\n\n“Hy-Vee anticipates receiving its allocations for the newly approved age groups in the coming days,” Tina Potthoff, senior vice president of communications, wrote in an email.\n\n“As soon as we receive vaccine and our appointment scheduler is open for these age groups, we will post an update on our COVID-19 vaccine landing page, post on our Hy-Vee store Facebook pages, and contact media outlets in our eight-state region to make them aware of our pediatric hubs that are accepting appointments.”\n\nDue to federal regulations, she wrote, Hy-Vee will only be providing vaccinations to children 3 and older.\n\n“Under the PREP Act, retail pharmacies, including Hy-Vee pharmacies, are only authorized to administer vaccines to patients ages 3+,” Potthoff wrote in the email. “Patients younger than age 3 should visit their pediatrician or health care provider to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/health/fda-vaccine-authorization-younger-kids/index.html", "title": "FDA authorizes Covid-19 vaccines for younger children | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for emergency use in young children.

Califf said in a news release. “Those trusted with the care of children can have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of these COVID-19 vaccines and can be assured that the agency was thorough in its evaluation of the data.”\n\nPreviously, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized for people 5 and older and approved for 16 and up, and Moderna’s vaccine was authorized only for adults.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, called Covid-19 vaccines for younger age groups a “milestone.”\n\n“It is a bit of a milestone to bring down the age range for these vaccines as we work through this,” Marks said Wednesday in a meeting of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n\nIn that meeting, the committee members voted unanimously in favor of expanding the authorizations to include children as young as 6 months.\n\n“To be able to vote for authorization of two vaccines that will protect children down to 6 months of age against this deadly disease is a very important thing,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nShe compared the day to December 2020, when the first Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for adults and older teens.\n\n“I’m really pleased that we’ve reached this kind of milestone,” said committee member Dr. Ofer Levy, of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who also likened the moment to when Covid-19 vaccines previously were authorized for other age groups.\n\n“I recall our first vote a year ago or more on the first Pfizer authorization,” Levy said. “I was one of the 17 votes in favor. I remember those early discussions – even then, should the 16- and 17-year-olds be included? At that point, that was a controversial topic that was being discussed. And here we are now, as a committee unanimously recommending authorization down to 6 months of age. So we’ve come a long way.”\n\nWill the youngest children get vaccinated?\n\nMany public health experts worry that even though the Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for younger age groups, parents of these children might not take their kids to receive the vaccinations.\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among children in the United States.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nBarouch, who is not involved in the FDA’s decision, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November. But just 29% of these children are fully vaccinated with their two-dose primary series in the United States, according to the CDC, compared with about:\n\n60% of adolescents 12 to 17\n\n64% of adults 18 to 24\n\n67% of adults 25 to 39\n\n75% of adults 40 to 49\n\n82% of adults 50 to 64\n\n94% of adults 65 to 74\n\n88% of adults 75 and older\n\n“We are planning and preparing for the rollout of pediatric vaccines. Of course, there’s a lot of work to be done to look at uptake of this vaccine. Some of the polls and surveys that have gone out to the public have indicated an ongoing lessening of parents considering giving their children these vaccines over time,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor survey, published in May, only 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine was available.\n\n“I think the more the pandemic is in the rearview mirror for some people – or they believe it is – then the less compelled they will be to do this, and so we have a big public health education campaign ahead of us,” Freeman said. “Also, health departments at the local level will be looking to understand the landscape of their community in terms of how many providers, pediatricians and pharmacies have actually signed up to give out the vaccine.”\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age.

We are aware of an extremely rare disorder involving people with blood clots in combination with low platelets in a small number of individuals who have received our COVID-19 vaccine. … We have been working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public.”\n\nIn an updated fact sheet on the vaccine, the FDA says that 15% of TTS cases have been fatal.\n\nThe agency’s updated analysis of the vaccine includes cases reported to its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database through March 18. The FDA says it has confirmed 60 cases of TTS, including nine deaths.\n\nOverall, the risk of TTS is extremely rare: about three cases for every million doses of vaccine administered.

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) noted on Saturday that if any Pfizer vaccine is given, then the vaccination series needs to contain three doses.\n\n“We’ll be monitoring inventory as the vaccines are delivered starting Monday to clinics, pharmacies and other clinical settings to determine when the search for the under-five vaccines will be available on vaccines.gov,” Dr. Kevin Chatham-Stephens, the Pediatric Vaccine Planning and Implementation Lead with the CDC’s Vaccine Task Force, said in ACIP’s meeting.\n\n“Parents and caregivers can reach out to the child’s pediatrician or family practice doctor or a local health department, pharmacy, et cetera to ask if they have the vaccine, understanding that not every clinic or pharmacy will get their vaccine on Monday.”\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for young children\n\nOn Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorizations for Moderna’s vaccine to include children 6 months through 17 years and Pfizer/BioNTech’s for children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisers will be discussing use of the Moderna vaccine in older children ages 6 to 17 years of age at their meeting June 23.\n\nAbout 17 million kids under the age of 5 are now are eligible for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nCovid-19 is the leading cause of infectious disease-related death in people up to 19 years old, but data shows that those deaths can be prevented through vaccination, Dr. Matthew Daley said in Friday’s ACIP meeting.\n\n“Covid-19 is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases for people ages 0 to 19 years. And Covid-19 is the seventh most common of all causes of death for people ages 0 to 19 years,” Daley, senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, told the committee.\n\n“Through March of 2022, unvaccinated people 5 years of age and older had 10 times the risk of dying from Covid-19 compared to those vaccinated with at least the primary series,” Daley said, adding that in other words, the data “provide real-world evidence that most deaths from Covid-19 are preventable through vaccination.”\n\nIn Saturday’s ACIP meeting, Dr. Veronica McNally said she was “struck” by the impact Covid-19 has had on children.\n\n“I am struck by these numbers: 2 million cases, 20,000 hospitalizations and over 200 deaths. And I am also concerned that there’s really an underappreciation for the potential severity of a respiratory virus in kids in this age and an unclear understanding sometimes in parents about the long-term consequences, including MIS-C,” McNally said.\n\nWill the youngest children get vaccinated?\n\nMany public health experts worry that even though the Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for younger age groups, parents of these children might not take their kids to get them.\n\n“The hard work only continues,” after recommending the vaccine, Daley said, citing the importance of communicating to parents “how vitally important these vaccines are to protect children’s lives.”\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in children.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said Wednesday.\n\nBarouch, who is not involved in the FDA’s or CDC’s decisions, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November. But just 29% of these children are fully vaccinated with their two-dose primary series in the United States, according to the CDC, compared with about:\n\n60% of adolescents 12 to 17\n\n64% of adults 18 to 24\n\n67% of adults 25 to 39\n\n75% of adults 40 to 49\n\n82% of adults 50 to 64\n\n94% of adults 65 to 74\n\n88% of adults 75 and older\n\n“We are planning and preparing for the rollout of pediatric vaccines. Of course, there’s a lot of work to be done to look at uptake of this vaccine. Some of the polls and surveys that have gone out to the public have indicated an ongoing lessening of parents considering giving their children these vaccines over time,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor survey published in May, only 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine was available.\n\n“I think the more the pandemic is in the rearview mirror for some people – or they believe it is – then the less compelled they will be to do this, and so we have a big public health education campaign ahead of us,” Freeman said. “Also, health departments at the local level will be looking to understand the landscape of their community in terms of how many providers, pediatricians and pharmacies have actually signed up to give out the vaccine.”\n\nPediatrics groups support ACIP’s recommendation\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) both released statements Saturday in support of a vote to recommend Covid-19 vaccines in children as young as six months.\n\nSpeaking in the CDC meeting on Saturday, Dr. Bonnie Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said it would be important to focus distribution equitably.\n\n“As of June 8, 23 million children ages five to 17 have received two doses of Covid vaccine. But another 26 million in this age group have yet to receive any doses. Our work is cut out for us. We must also all work together to reduce disparities and address barriers to vaccination in every community so that all children and families can benefit from the protection of these vaccines,” she said.\n\nPatsy Stinchfield, with NAPNAP, also spoke in support of the recommendation but asked ACIP to stress the importance of vaccination in this age group.\n\n“I was a bit dismayed with some of the headlines coming out after the VRBPAC decision emphasizing quote, it’s up to the parents. This can be misinterpreted to consider this vaccine in young children as optional. We don’t say to parents of a baby with a cardiac defect, ‘it’s up to you for your child to have open heart surgery.’ We say, ‘your child needs open heart surgery’,” she said.\n\n“We don’t get out of pandemics with ‘it’s-up-to-you’-type strategies,” she said.\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age. For older children, ages 6 to 11, the doses are 50 micrograms each.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine now can be given as a three-dose primary series, at 3 micrograms each dose, for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, a vaccine adviser to the FDA, said Wednesday that children who get the Pfizer vaccine will have to complete a three-dose series to get sufficient protection.\n\n” ‘Do the benefits outweigh the risks’ is something I can support, but I do have some concerns about this vaccine,” said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who also serves on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, agreed.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” she said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nAccording to clinical trial data, common side effects for both vaccines include pain at the injection site, headache, fever, chills and fatigue. The vaccines appeared to elicit similar immune responses in children as has been seen in adults.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee determined that the benefits of both vaccines outweigh the risks and noted that the vaccines have been “well-tolerated” among the children who got them in clinical trials.\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a discussion about the Moderna vaccine.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” he said. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nHe added that the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths in all ages.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/health/fda-advisers-vote-omicron-booster/index.html", "title": "FDA advisers vote to include an Omicron-specific component for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration’s independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted Tuesday to support recommending inclusion of an Omicron-specific component for a Covid-19 booster vaccine.\n\nTwenty-one voting members of the FDA’s independent committee voted on the question:\n\n“Does the committee recommend inclusion of a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron component for COVID-19 booster vaccines in the United States?”\n\nNineteen of the members voted yes, two voted no.\n\n“I voted in favor of Omicron because I think it’s important to broaden immunity,” said Dr. Wayne Marasco, a professor of medicine with the department of cancer immunology and virology Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School. “I will say that I was pretty impressed today that we can do better.”\n\n“I think this is a step in the right direction, but we have to reevaluate this as we move forward,” he added.\n\nThe committee felt that a modified vaccine would offer broader protection to match the coronavirus strain that is in circulation now.\n\nTwo Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, are now dominating transmission of Covid-19 in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFuture US Covid-19 vaccines will be different\n\nThis means that the Covid-19 vaccine people in the US will get in the future will be different. The committee does not determine how, and the committee was not asked to vote on what sublineage to include or whether the booster should be monovalent vaccine or a bivalent vaccine, which would include two strains.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said there will be a conversation going forward to determine who needs another booster and what that booster will look like. Marks noted that a bivalent vaccine targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants seemed to be the preference of the committee.\n\nWhen the FDA’s independent vaccine advisers had met in April, they agreed that they had to develop a framework for how the country can keep up with the evolving virus with an appropriate vaccine strategy.\n\nThe FDA said in May that the “new normal” may include an annual Covid-19 and flu shot for people in the fall. Cases are expected to rise again in the fall and winter.\n\nChallenging work ahead\n\nDr. Arnold Monto, the acting chair of the independent vaccine advisers committee, suggested determining what goes into the booster will not be easy.\n\n“I think we have done the best we can in a difficult situation with imperfect data and inability to say what is going to follow what looks like Omicron 4 or 5 wave,” said Monto. “We’ve looked at the options that are available and come up with a set of recommendations and some advice that FDA can follow.”\n\nMoving forward to create a vaccine to best fight a virus that changes quickly is “uncharted territory”\n\n“Looking in the past doesn’t help us a great deal to look in the future for this virus which has baffled a lot of us and made predictions almost irrelevant,” Monto added.\n\nWhat the companies are working on\n\nCurrent Covid-19 vaccines are based on the coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, but Pfizer and Moderna have been working on updated versions of the vaccines. The current vaccines are not as effective against the variants in circulation.\n\nModerna presented details about its bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, mRNA-1273.214, which the company said elicits “potent” immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna’s original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant.\n\nPfizer/BioNTech also presented data to the committee that showed that their two Covid-19 vaccine boosters targeting Omicron showed a substantially higher immune response than its current Covid-19 vaccine. Preliminary lab studies suggest the vaccines could neutralize the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nAnother vaccine maker, Novavax, has committee support for emergency use authorization in the United States, but the FDA has not yet authorized its vaccine. Novavax told the committee that it has been developing variant-specific updated versions of its Covid-19 vaccine as well as a Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine.\n\nBroader is better\n\nThe World Health Organization told the independent committee of vaccine advisers Tuesday that the vaccination strategy going forward should probably be based around a vaccine that would offer as broad a kind of protection as possible, rather than just continuing with the vaccines that were made against the original strain that is no longer in circulation.\n\n“I still think there’s value in increasing the breath of immunity and I will reiterate that we’re not trying to match what may circulate,” said Dr. Kanta Subbarao with the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza and the University of Melbourne. “It is not so much to match what is likely to circulate because there’s so much uncertainty about the trajectory of this evolution.”\n\nIncluding Omicron in a future vaccine would help because Omicron is the most distinct of the variants of concern that have emerged she said, but a standalone vaccine that would match just Omicron would not likely be broad enough to protect against other variants going forward.\n\n“We’re trying to increase the breadth of the immune response without losing the benefit from the index vaccine that’s performed so well,” she added.\n\n“We simply don’t have enough information on any of the other variants, but I could make a strong case based on our experience with influenza that using a virus to boost that is antigenitically as far as possible, is a better strategy than something that is partway there,” she added.\n\nThe longer that Omicron is the dominant variant circulating in the world, the odds are that whatever comes after it will come from Omicron.\n\n“At least that’s a realistic possibility,” Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in FDA’s vaccine research office, told the committee.\n\nFuture Covid-19 vaccine strategy\n\nGoing forward, as the committee determines how to create a process for the future if people will need regular Covid-19 boosters, members agreed that there needed to be better central coordination on studies and on what the plans should be going forward.\n\n“Without such a plan, we’re going to be playing Whack a Mole as this virus evolves, because it’s going to continue to evolve,” said committee member Dr. Bruce Gellin, chief of global public health strategy with the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n“We’ll get better at this, but we still need to get ahead of it,” he said.\n\nWeir, with the FDA, tried to help the committee keep what they have accomplished in perspective.\n\n“I think we’ve made enormous progress in this whole endeavor over the last few months, but I’ll remind you that the sort of parallel track of influenza strain selection, which works very well, was a process that was honed over many, many years and so we probably have quite a bit of work. This is a different virus. We have a lot of work to do on the strain selection process for Covid vaccines.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSeveral committee members also were concerned about the lack of data concerning what should go into future pediatric vaccines.\n\n“In terms of extrapolating available data, I am very hesitant to extrapolate that from adults into children,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, who is dean of Chicago Medical School. “I think the pediatric studies need to be done and they need to be done now.”\n\nFollowing the VRBPAC vote, the FDA will rule on the updated vaccine.

How is that defined?\n\nDr. David Hill: What they are giving us as an example is a child who’s had a solid organ transplant, for example, like a kidney or liver transplant. But they are also saying children with equivalent degrees of immunocompromise – for example, there are hereditary conditions that may lead to fairly severe degrees of immunocompromise. Those children are almost certainly already being seen by an immunologist or an infectious disease specialist.\n\nIf you are a parent who thinks that your child may qualify for the booster based on their immune status, check in with a doctor who is managing their condition and see what they say.\n\nCNN: When will boosters for this age group be available?\n\nHill: That is a great question. What we know is that there is one more step: a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, called the ACIP. The CDC has said that they are anticipating a meeting later this week. Once the ACIP signs off on this, then implementation should occur very quickly.\n\nThere can be delays in terms of ordering and stocking the vaccine in various locations.\n\nCNN: How will I know if the booster will be in stock in my area?\n\nHill: I know that the availability of vaccines continues to vary by location and demand. I have not seen specific reports on where shortages might exist. I do know that you can check in with local health care authorities or your health department to find the best place to get the booster administered.\n\nCNN: What do I need to bring to the appointment?\n\nHill: Definitely bring your child’s vaccine card. The booster needs to occur at least five months after the child’s second dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, so facilities will be looking for some evidence as to when that second dose was administered.\n\nMany states now have a statewide vaccine registry. If the location where you got your booster participates in the statewide registry, there may actually be an electronic document that should be available throughout the state, so that’s another source of confirmation.\n\nAnd then there is your child’s electronic health record, which track vaccines. The electronic health records sometimes have to be adjusted to accommodate the development of a new vaccine or a new vaccine schedule, and the vendors who program those records are usually very responsive, to make sure that the systems are ready when the CDC approves the booster.\n\nCNN: How does this dose compare to the original vaccine doses and what are the side effects?\n\nHill: It should be the same. I haven’t seen that there is any difference in the dose for the booster compared to the first two vaccines.\n\nThe common side effects from the booster remain the same as they are for the first two vaccines, so obviously there may be pain or redness or swelling at the injection site. Some people will experience fatigue or headaches, they may have muscle or joint pains, they may have chills.\n\nOne thing that seems a little bit more common with the booster dose is swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the dose was given. Lymph nodes are our body’s way of responding to infection or inflammation, so it’s not unusual with any inflammatory response to see some lymph nodes swelling. But that seems to be a little more common with the booster dose.\n\nThe good news, in terms of side effects, is that none of the children studied so far have developed cardiomyopathy. That doesn’t surprise us, because you probably need to get millions of shots before you think a single case of cardiomyopathy, and of course we haven’t given millions of third vaccines in this age group yet. But it’s very heartening that, of the people who have been studied, there has not been a single case.\n\nCNN: Would you advise parents and caregivers to keep their child home from school the day after their booster shot?\n\nHill: I think most children will be able to go to school the following day. But if childcare is difficult for you, it would probably be good to have a backup plan in case your child were to feel too bad or to have a fever that would keep them out of school.\n\nCNN: How long before that boost of immunity kicks in after the booster shot?\n\nHill: What we know so far from boosters in other age groups is that it looks like a significant boost in the immunity you already have occurs in the first seven days and is maximized by about 14 days. It’s not a switch that clicks on after seven to 14 days, however, it’s kind of a curve that goes up over that two weeks.\n\nCNN: Do we know how well the boosters protect against the Delta or Omicron variants?\n\nHill: We do have data on how well the boosters protect against Delta and Omicron, and they appear to protect extremely well. Now when you say protect, it’s very important to ask, protect against what? People will say, “Oh, you know, I got the vaccine, and I still contracted Covid-19.” Yes, that may happen. In fact, that is guaranteed to happen to a certain number of people.\n\nWhat you want to know is, are you are less likely to be hospitalized? Are you less likely to die? And the answer is yes. The effectiveness of these vaccines against serious, life-threatening illness is extraordinarily high.\n\nIt’s no different than the question people have with flu vaccines: It’s not uncommon to get vaccinated against the flu and then get a mild case of influenza. That can happen. But the vaccine against flu has always been strongly protected against hospitalization and death, and this is a similar situation. Data on the endpoints that count – such as “Will I be alive next year? Will I be able to breathe?” – are extraordinarily positive.\n\nCNN: Parents often see comments online about how the vaccine – including the booster – may harm their child’s development. What are the facts?\n\nHill: There are absolutely no data suggesting that these vaccines had any negative impact on child development at all. The side effects that we’re aware of are temporary, fairly mild, comparatively speaking, and none of them are permanent.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere is still this concern of cardiomyopathy, particularly in older teenagers. But even when we have seen children get this incredibly rare side effect, the vast majority have recovered with no long-term health issues.

He was thrilled because finally, there was a drug that could protect people like him who are immune-compromised and had a weak response, or no response at all, to their vaccinations.\n\n“Exciting news – FDA grants emergency use authorization [to Evusheld],” Henry wrote in a post published December 18.\n\nA few weeks later, a reader wrote back that she’d been able to find the drug.\n\n“Congratulations on getting this medication,” Henry responded. “I know it is in short supply.”\n\nBut Henry, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and a pharmacist with multiple advanced degrees, was unable to find Evusheld. He contracted the virus and died from complications of Covid-19 on February 9.\n\nIn the State of the Union address this month, President Joe Biden said that “if you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments. … We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.”\n\nBut a CNN investigation raises questions about the way federal and state governments have distributed Evusheld and why, more than three months into the rollout, many immune-compromised people are still having trouble getting it.\n\nCNN’s investigation found that as the Omicron variant ripped through the United States, infecting and killing Americans, including some who might have been saved with timely access to Evusheld, thousands of boxes of the drug have been sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nCNN also found that the government distributed Evusheld, a drug that was developed by AstraZeneca with the support of the US government, to unlikely places such as a spa that offers Botox and another location that does eyelash extensions.\n\nThen, last week, the US Department of Health and Human Services removed at least dozens of locations that have Evusheld from an online locator, which means millions of immune compromised patients and their doctors can no longer find them.\n\n“This whole thing is sad. It’s just very, very sad,” said Henry’s widow, Meli Rockhold. “It reminds me of the government response to Katrina. It’s just a cluster – I can’t say that next word.”\n\nA leading researcher on Covid-19 and the immune-compromised emphasized that Evusheld, a monoclonal antibody, is the only prevention available for immune-compromised people – transplant patients and some cancer patients, for example, or people who take certain medications for rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions – who had a weak response to the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“For people who did everything they could but didn’t have an adequate response to the vaccines, [Evusheld] is their only hope, and to deny them that because of a disorganized and chaotic distribution and education rollout is just terrible,” said Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon and epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health.\n\nJanet Handal, who runs an advocacy organization for people who are immune-compromised, says she hears every day from people who can’t find Evusheld.\n\n“It’s just a tragedy that this is happening because there is such a great need for Evusheld, and there’s so many people who don’t have it,” said Handal, the founder of the Transplant Recipients and Immunocompromised Patient Advocacy Group.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback FDA approves drug to help protect the immunocompromised from Covid 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nThe federal government distributes Evusheld and other Covid-19 medicines to states based on their population. States then distribute the drugs to various locations.\n\n“We make these allocations to states and territories on a weekly basis, with states and territories ultimately determining how best to distribute the product within their jurisdictions,” according to a statement to CNN from an official with HHS. “We encourage jurisdictions to distribute the product in ways that ensure it reaches immunosuppressed patients such as prioritization of medical centers where these populations typically receive care.”\n\nThe head of an association of state health officials noted that state health departments are managing the distribution of five different Covid-19 drugs, including Evusheld.\n\n“I think most state health departments do not want to be in the medical supply chain business. That’s not their core competency,” said Michael Fraser, the CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “It’s a complex problem, and it’s happening in real time.”\n\nFraser added that state health departments are looking forward to the time when the private sector starts distributing Covid-19 drugs.\n\n‘It’s just a waste’\n\nOn March 10, Avi Patel walked out the front door of his Florida pharmacy and unexpectedly found himself in possession of 192 boxes of Evusheld.\n\n“All of a sudden, I see [these] huge boxes arriving at my doorstep. It just popped up,” said Patel, a pharmacist who owns Lemon Bay Drugs East in Englewood, Florida.\n\nTwo weeks later, Patel hasn’t used a single one of those 192 boxes.\n\n“It’s just a waste,” Patel said.\n\nCNN interviews with dozens of US pharmacies reveal that Patel’s situation is not unique: Many of them have used up none or very little of the Evusheld that their state health departments sent them.\n\nTo see how much Evusheld is sitting unused on pharmacy shelves, CNN in February downloaded an HHS database of sites that have Evusheld. CNN identified 59 retail pharmacies and the number of boxes of the drug they had received. Each patient needs two boxes for a full course of treatment.\n\nOn March 16-21, CNN confirmed with 58 of those pharmacies the number of boxes they had received and how many boxes they had remaining.\n\nIn total, these 58 pharmacies have received 5,372 boxes of Evusheld from the federal government, which is enough to treat 2,686 patients. Most of the shipments were in January and February and some in March.\n\nAs of CNN’s calls last week, the pharmacies had used up 1,376 of those 5,372 boxes. That means about three-quarters of the drug the pharmacies received, or 3,996 boxes, is still unused. That’s enough to treat 1,998 patients.\n\nRed Rock Pharmacy in Tempe, Arizona, received 480 boxes of Evusheld by early February. It has not used up a single box.\n\nThe De Queen Health and Wellness Pharmacy in De Queen, Arkansas, received 264 boxes by March 3 and has used just two of them.\n\nDr. Aziz Pharmacy in Indianapolis hasn’t used any of the 72 boxes they received by January 27.\n\nTrieu Bao, pharmacist and co-founder of Soleil Pharmacy in Glen Burnie, Maryland, said he hasn’t used any of the 96 boxes that were sent to him before March 1, and they’ve asked the state to stop sending the drug because of lack of space to store it.\n\nThe issue, according to pharmacists, doctors and patient advocates, is that unlike the Covid-19 vaccines, pharmacists need a prescription before giving Evusheld, and those prescriptions have been slow in coming.\n\n“Pharmacists aren’t allowed to administer Evusheld [without a prescription], so to send this many is ridiculous,” said Patel, the Florida pharmacist.\n\n“Pharmacies don’t know what to do with it,” added Michael Hogue, dean of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy and a liaison representative from the American Pharmacists Association to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “They’re getting Evusheld from states, but pharmacists don’t have the authority to prescribe it, so their hands are tied.”\n\nHogue said distributing the drug to pharmacists “really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense” and that the federal government has had “a not very well-thought-out plan on how to distribute Evusheld.”\n\nTo increase access to the drugs, patients and pharmacists have tried to educate their doctors about Evusheld.\n\n“We’ve had people in our group call their doctor and ask about Evusheld and been told, ‘What’s that?’ ” said Handal, the founder of the advocacy group for immune-compromised patients.\n\n“My experience is, most doctors have no clue about these treatment options,” said Harsh Patel, pharmacist and co-founder of Queens Pharmacy in Charlotte, North Carolina, which has not used any of the 24 boxes it received by late January.\n\nDoctors don’t know about Evusheld partly because it came out at a time when there was an “avalanche” of news about other Covid-19 drugs, said Dr. William Schaffner, a liaison representative from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee.\n\nHHS began distributing Evusheld on December 17, and around that time, the FDA authorized a different monoclonal antibody drug that often gets confused with Evusheld, even though the other drug, bebtelovimab, treats Covid-19 and Evusheld is for prevention. Also around this time, two other monoclonal drugs were taken out of circulation, and the FDA authorized two antiviral medications.\n\n“No one knows about Evusheld,” said Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “I think it’s very sad.”\n\nEven if a doctor does know about Evusheld, locating it can be complicated. Some doctors’ offices have it, but most do not. Some pharmacies have it, but not large retail chains such as CVS and Walgreens, where many Americans get their prescriptions. That means doctors have to know to search for the federal government locator website that lists some – but not all – of the locations that carry it.\n\n“There’s never been a mechanism that says ‘hear ye, hear ye, we have a new way to protect your immune-compromised patients against Covid, and here’s how you get it for your patients,’ ” Schaffner said.\n\nIf immune-compromised patients want to advocate for themselves and find a pharmacy with Evusheld, they must defy a government warning in large bold type on top of its online locator that tells patients “the therapeutics locator is intended for provider use” and that “patients should not contact locations directly unless instructed to do so by their healthcare provider.”\n\nIf a patient defies the warning and uses the locator, it’s of limited use because it’s missing at least dozens of locations that have Evusheld.\n\nOf the 59 pharmacies with Evusheld that CNN identified on the HHS database in February, HHS removed 30 on March 16, even though all of them still had Evusheld when CNN contacted them last week. Together, these 30 pharmacies that the government removed from public view have more than 2,400 boxes of Evusheld, and now doctors and patients now have no way of finding them.\n\nAmong the pharmacies with Evusheld that HHS removed from its locator are Prescriptions Unlimited, DeliveRxd, Red Rock Pharmacy, Queens Pharmacy and Lemon Bay Drugs East, which all have Evusheld.\n\nHHS’s response\n\nAt a March 2 meeting among HHS and state health officials, Dr. Derek Eisnor, the federal government’s lead official on allocation and distribution of Covid-19 drugs, said the “utilization rate is low” for Evusheld.\n\nAt a March 9 meeting among HHS officials and national health care and medical associations, Eisnor said the agency was “somewhat dismayed” about the low utilization numbers.\n\nAt that meeting, Cicely Waters, director of external affairs for the HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness & Response, read a question from one of the attendees.\n\n“[Are] there any successful ways to connect prescribers to patients that want product?” Waters read. “I’ve heard of news stories about patients who want Evusheld and sites that have product, but there’s still no way to get it to those patients.” The attendee then asked HHS for its thoughts on “closing that treatment gap.”\n\n“It’s frustrating,” Eisnor answered. “It’s really a question of what are the best mechanisms to get that patient in front of that provider and as expeditiously as possible, and so I think some of this is obviously going to depend on the location and the site or the institution. But it is – it is frustrating.”\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told CNN that the agency has done two dozen meetings recently with states, providers and others “to not only encourage greater utilization but to do education about how the product works and who it’s for and answer questions about how best to manage supply to target those at high-risk.”\n\n“We continue to engage provider and advocacy groups that support immunocompromised patients to help increase overall awareness and utilization of Evusheld. In addition to the dozens of engagements we’ve held with these groups, we have also created virtual resources as well as a platform for clinician peer-to-peer sharing of best practices, case studies, and administration models,” an HHS official wrote in another email.\n\nThe official said HHS removed a site from its locator if it has “less than five patient courses” of Covid-19 therapeutics. Of the 30 pharmacies that CNN found had been removed from the locator, pharmacists at 29 of them told CNN they had more than five boxes left of Evusheld. Most of them had considerably more, and several had hundreds of boxes left each.\n\nHHS also said that “if a location goes seven days without reporting their product on hand and utilization amounts, that location is removed from the map since we cannot confirm product availability at that location.” The official added that removing “numerous” locations from the map last week “helped improve data reliability and overall product access.”\n\nThe official did not explain how removing sites from the locator that collectively have thousands of boxes of Evusheld improves product access.\n\n“That makes no sense whatsoever,” said Handal, the founder of the advocacy group for immune-compromised people. “How could anybody even say that with a straight face?”\n\nEvusheld sent to sites offering beauty treatments\n\nCNN also reached out to the two locations offering beauty treatments that received Evusheld from the government.\n\nTwenty-four boxes of Evusheld were sent to a location in Las Vegas that, in a cached version of its website, describes itself as a “premier medical spa chosen by the stars to help them look younger,” with services such as Botox and “facial rejuvenation.” CNN was unable to find a current website or contact information for anyone at this location.\n\nShannon Litz, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN that “the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy has reviewed this inquiry and determined it is in compliance, as the medication is being used by the physician in a different part of his practice.”\n\n“We did an inquiry on it, and they’re operating within the rules of the EUA and the federal program,” said Dave Wuest, executive secretary of the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy. “There was a physician that was licensed there at the time that we sent the medicine there.”\n\nBut a Google Maps search of the address listed for the location shows an outdoor strip mall, with no indication of the business existing. Wuest said the location may have closed, and it would be up to the provider to notify the state if it had.\n\n“Things change,” Wuest said. “I’m going to send somebody to the location and see if there’s a practitioner there.”\n\nTwenty-four Evusheld boxes were sent to Integrative Medicine, Laser, and Aesthetics, in Carmel, Indiana, which offers, along with some health services, eyelash extensions and facial hair removal. The medicine was delivered prior to January 28, according to the HHS database.\n\nNone of those boxes has been used, according to Sarah Wygant, a medical assistant and paramedic at Integrative Medicine, Laser, and Aesthetics.\n\n“Once the Evusheld product was offered, this provider met the necessary requirements to receive an allocation, which included having a physician providing oversight,” Megan Wade-Taxter, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Health, wrote in an email CNN.\n\nA ‘Hunger Games’-like competition for Evusheld\n\nWhile many pharmacies have too much Evusheld, several medical centers say they don’t have nearly enough for their immune-compromised patients.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, has received 2,352 boxes of Evusheld, according to now removed HHS data, and the hospital has between 10,000 to 15,000 patients who could benefit, said Dr. Raymund Razonable, an infectious disease expert who heads up the hospital’s monoclonal antibody program.\n\nTo prioritize who gets the medication, Mayo has set up a tiered priority system – and the 2,352 boxes doesn’t even cover the first tier, which has 3,000 patients, he said.\n\n“Things are tough right now. There’s not enough supply,” Razonable said.\n\nThe Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, has received enough Evusheld for just over 500 patients, according to spokeswoman Kim Polacek, and there are “potentially thousands” of Moffitt patients who could benefit from the drug, according to Dr. Robert Keenan, Moffitt’s chief medical officer.\n\n“When you know there is a therapy that’s been developed but you don’t yet have the ability to give it to a patient, that’s an awful thing to have to tell the patient and an awful thing to have to deal with,” Keenan said.\n\nCNN spoke with some medical centers that said they are not feeling strapped for Evusheld and have been able to get it to the patients who need it.\n\nBut some patients eligible for Evusheld have described a “Hunger Games”-like endeavor to find the drug.\n\n“It’s almost like we are in a game and competing,” said Michele Nadeem-Baker, who has chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has not been able to get Evusheld from her doctors in Boston. “It’s almost Darwinian and survival of the fittest.”\n\nDr. Brian Koffman, a retired family doctor in Claremont, California, who has CLL, said he’s “one of the lucky ones” who’s been able to get Evusheld. He writes a blog to help other CLL patients and describes the roller coaster of emotions that many immune-compromised patients go through upon learning about Evusheld and then not being able to find it.\n\n“There’s this light at the end of the tunnel that says ‘we have a way out’ [but then] ‘oh, sorry, you can’t get it,’ ” Koffman said.\n\nWithout protection against the virus, many immune-compromised people who did not get a full response from the vaccine and can’t find Evusheld are left to stay at home, still on lockdown after more than two years.\n\n“We’re doing everything we can to rejoin society,” said Doreen Zetterlund of Los Angeles, who has CLL and has been trying unsuccessfully to get the drug. “[Evusheld] is the one last piece that will help us.”\n\nKeenan, the chief medical officer at Moffitt, remembers Henry, the pharmacist who was unable to get Evusheld and died from Covid-19. Henry got care for his chronic lymphocytic leukemia at Moffitt, and he was the center’s chief pharmacy officer in 2018.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMoffitt didn’t start administering Evusheld until January 24, Keenan said. That would have been too late for Henry, since by that time, he was already sick with Covid.\n\n“Here’s Tom Henry – you couldn’t get more sophisticated about medications, [yet] he succumbs to Covid,” added Koffman, the family physician and the chief medical officer of the CLL Society. “Even when you’re [an] expert, you may not survive this.”\n\nNow, Henry’s family – and the CLL patients he helped – wonder whether Henry might be alive today if he’d been able to get Evusheld in December, when he first excitedly told his readers about the new drug.\n\n“Would he be alive today, doing the great work that [he’d] been doing?” said Diane Langan, a CLL patient in Syracuse, New York, who followed Henry’s blog. “It’s been very discouraging and very, very disheartening.”", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen Danielle Herman", "Elizabeth Cohen", "Danielle Herman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.\n\nP.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch footage from first Titanic dive in 14 years (2019) 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nIn an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.\n\n“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”\n\nThe abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.\n\nRocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He found the Titanic. Here's his next mission 11:53 - Source: CNN\n\n“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”\n\nThe researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.\n\nThere is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.\n\nOceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.\n\n“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}]}

Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now.

Here’s why.\n\nWhy won’t there be a new election?\n\nIn the UK, general elections must be held at least every five years.\n\nLuckily for the Conservative Party, which is currently in power but trailing the opposition in opinion polls, the next vote doesn’t need to be held until January 2025.\n\nThat’s because in the UK, prime ministers are not elected directly by the people. In fact, four of the last five British prime ministers came into the role without a general election.\n\nTruss is in Downing Street because she is the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. She was picked by the roughly 172,000 members of the Conservative Party after the departure of Boris Johnson, who himself became prime minister without a general election after winning the party leadership contest in 2019 – although he did call a new vote in December that year and won.\n\nTheresa May, who served as prime minister before Johnson, also first became PM without an election, as did Labour’s Gordon Brown when he replaced Tony Blair in 2007.\n\nSo how will the new PM be picked?\n\nThe Conservative Party is still the largest one in Parliament, so its new leader will automatically become prime minister.\n\nWhile the last leadership election took almost two months – longer than Truss will spend as prime minister – the next one will be swift.\n\nGraham Brady, leader of the 1922 Committee, which represents rank-and-file Conservative members of parliament, said Thursday the new PM will be chosen by next Friday.\n\nTo narrow the field of those in the running, the candidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from Conservative MPs, which means there will be a maximum of three people in the running.\n\nMust the new prime minister call a general election?\n\nNo. The next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025.\n\nHowever, the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote will put pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe last time three successive prime ministers entered Downing Street without standing in a general election was before and during the World War II.\n\nThe opposition, sensing an opportunity, is pushing for a new vote. Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, repeated his calls on Thursday for an early general election. “After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” he said in a statement posted on Twitter. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote, saying a new “general election is now a democratic imperative.”\n\nWhat do British people think about all this?\n\nJudging by the numerous protests, jokes and memes, many are far from impressed. A public petition calling for a new election was launched in September. It gathered more than 715,000 signatures and was debated in parliament earlier this week.\n\nHowever, there is little the public can do if the Conservative Party, which is firmly in control of parliament, decides not to call an election now. For many Conservative lawmakers, voting for an early election would mean the end of their political careers. The odds of that happening are likely to be low.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/uk/boris-johnson-vote-of-confidence-uk-prime-minister-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson, British Prime Minister, squeaks through confidence ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has survived a confidence vote by members of his own party – but the final count of lawmakers who rebelled against him was far higher than his supporters expected.\n\nAfter a tidal wave of recent criticism – which included illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices – Johnson squeaked by with 211 votes to 148 in a secret ballot on Monday.\n\nThe government hailed the result, with Johnson saying he thought “this is a very good result for politics and for the country.”\n\n“I think it’s a convincing result, a decisive result, and what it means is that as a government we can move on and focus on the stuff that really matters to people,” Johnson said.\n\nYet his thin margin of victory means that 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back Johnson, three years after he led the Conservative Party to a landslide victory in the last general election.\n\nVoting began at 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) Monday after Johnson urged Conservative lawmakers to back him and reminded them that he had led the party to its biggest electoral win in 40 years, according to a letter he wrote seen by PA Media.\n\nThe large rebellion by his lawmakers will leave Johnson’s reputation diminished and could damage his ability to push through legislation. Disappointing results for the party in upcoming polls could also heap more pressure on Johnson, as Conservatives face two difficult parliamentary by-elections in late June.\n\nDespite the victory, the opposition Labour Party has said that by hanging onto power this time, Johnson makes the prospect of an early election even more likely. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer predicted to LBC that Monday’s vote would mark “the beginning of the end” of the Prime Minister’s political career – no matter which way the vote went.\n\n“If you look at the previous examples of no confidence votes, even when Conservative Prime Ministers survive those … the damage is already done,” the opposition leader told LBC Monday. “Usually, they fall reasonably swiftly afterwards.”\n\nFollowing the vote, Starmer said Johnson was “utterly unfit for the great office he holds” and accused Conservative lawmakers of ignoring the British public. “The Conservative Government now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law.”\n\nScotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Johnson an “utterly lame duck” on Twitter following the vote.\n\n“That result is surely the worst of all worlds for the Tories. But much more importantly: at a time of huge challenge, it saddles the UK with an utterly lame duck PM,” Sturgeon said in a tweet on Monday night.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'No way out': Commentator predicts Boris Johnson's future 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson’s predecessor Theresa May was the last sitting British leader to face a no-confidence vote from their own party. May narrowly survived that vote, which had been called amid months of chaos over her doomed Brexit deal – but she ultimately resigned months later.\n\nMonday’s vote was triggered after more than 54 lawmakers sent letters to the chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, following a tidal wave of criticism over a number of scandals that have engulfed Johnson’s premiership for several months.\n\nLast month, a damning report by a senior civil servant found a culture of partying and socializing among Johnson’s staff during Covid-19 lockdown, while millions of Britons were banned from seeing their friends and relatives.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.\n\nThe Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.\n\nFollowing the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.\n\nOn Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. The trip by road ordinarily takes around three hours, however, it was driven slowly to allow people to witness the procession and bow their heads as it passed.\n\nAn honor guard made up of the Royal Regiment of Scotland greeted the hearse in Edinburgh with a royal salute before the coffin was transferred to the Throne Room by a military bearer party.\n\nMeanwhile, back in London, the King met with the Commonwealth secretary general before hosting a reception for the high commissioners from the realms of which he is now head of state in Buckingham Palace’s Bow Room.\n\nOn Monday morning, the King started the day with a trip to Westminster Hall where both Houses of Parliament expressed their condolences. He and his wife Camilla then flew to Edinburgh, where they headed straight to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nIn the afternoon, the King led a procession carrying the Queen’s coffin to St. Giles’ Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving attended by members of the royal family, as well as a congregation made up “from all areas of Scottish society,” according to a senior palace official. Afterward, the coffin rested there for 24 hours to allow the Scottish public to see it.\n\nFollowing the service, the King had an audience with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and a meeting with the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament. Charles, accompanied by the Queen Consort, also went to the Scottish Parliament to receive a motion of condolence.\n\nIn the evening, the King and members of the royal family mounted their own guard – or vigil – of the Queen’s coffin.\n\nThen-Prince Charles and his brother Edward, left, stand vigil beside their grandmother's coffin while the Queen Mother lies in state at Westminster Hall in 2002. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, the King and Camilla visited Belfast, Northern Ireland, as part of his first tour as monarch of the nations that make up the United Kingdom. The couple visited Hillsborough Castle and viewed an exhibition on the Queen’s long association with Northern Ireland. The King then met the secretary of state for Northern Ireland in addition to other party leaders, and received a message of condolence led by the speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nBack in Scotland, the Queen’s only daughter, Princess Anne, accompanied her mother’s body as it was flown back to London. The coffin traveled 8.2 miles (13.2 kilometers) by hearse to Edinburgh Airport, where it departed for RAF Northolt.\n\nA state hearse brought the monarch’s remains to Buckingham Palace, where the King, the Queen Consort, as well as other members of the Windsor clan, were waiting for the coffin’s arrival at around 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). The Dean of the Chapels Royal conducted prayers and a bearer party founded by The Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards placed the coffin on trestles in the center of the Bow Room to rest overnight.\n\nWednesday saw an extraordinary procession take the coffin on a gun carriage from Buckingham Palace over to Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, where the Queen will lie in state until the morning of the funeral.\n\nFor this journey, the coffin was be adorned with the Imperial State Crown and a flower wreath. The procession set off at 2:22 p.m. (9:22 a.m. ET) along The Mall, across Horse Guards Parade, past Downing Street toward Westminster.\n\nSenior royals including King Charles III and Princes William and Harry walked behind their beloved matriarch. They were followed by senior staff from the royal households as well as close personal staff and members of the Household Division. As crowds watched the procession – which took around 40 minutes – Big Ben tolled and minute guns fired by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery at Hyde Park echoed across the capital.\n\nThe Queen’s coffin was placed on a raised platform – or catafalque – in the middle of the hall and is being guarded around the clock by officers from the Household Division, the King’s Bodyguard or the Royal Company of Archers.\n\nUpon its arrival at Westminster Hall, a short service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, after which the hall opened for the public to pay their respects.\n\nKing Charles III walks with his sons behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday. Daniel Leal/Pool/AP\n\nMembers of the public filed past the Queen’s coffin during its first full day lying in state at Westminster Hall on Thursday.\n\nThe hall will be open 24 hours a day until 6:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m.) on the day of the Queen’s funeral. The UK government has warned that those wishing to pay their respects “will be required to queue for many hours, possibly overnight.” All those attending the lying in state will go through “airport-style” security with only small bags permitted.\n\nBrass plaques in the 11th-century hall mark the spot where Edward VII lay in state in 1910, George V in 1936, George VI in 1952 and Queen Mary a year later. The hall, which is 900 years old, is also where wartime British Prime Minister Winston Churchill lay in state in 1965.\n\nOn Friday, the lying in state continued for a second full day. Huge numbers of people lined up in central London for a chance to visit the coffin and be part of this historic moment.\n\nSeparately, King Charles and Camilla visited Wales on Friday, bringing their tour of all four nations that make up the United Kingdom to a close.\n\nPublic access to the lying in state continues into the weekend. And in a surprise announcement, the Queen’s eight grandchildren – including Princes William and Harry – will stand vigil beside her coffin on Saturday evening.\n\nSunday marks the final full day the Queen’s body will lie in state in Westminster Hall.\n\nThe UK public has also been invited to observe a minute’s silence at 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) in a national moment of reflection.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September 19 – declared a public holiday across the UK – the Queen’s lying in state will end. The coffin will then travel in procession once more to Westminster Abbey for the state funeral, the details of which will likely come in the following days.\n\nWestminster Abbey, founded in 960 AD by Benedictine monks, is one of the most recognizable landmarks in London. The historic church has been the setting for every coronation since 1066, and was where the then-Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947. But there hasn’t been a funeral of a monarch there since that of George II in 1760.\n\nHeads of state and dignitaries from around the world are expected to be invited to the British capital to join members of the royal family to celebrate the Queen’s life and unwavering service to the nation and Commonwealth. While a guest list has not yet been announced, US President Joe Biden plans to attend the funeral.\n\nOther familiar faces at the televised service will be some of the 15 prime ministers to have served during the Queen’s reign.\n\nAt its conclusion, the coffin will travel in procession to Wellington Arch, before making its final journey out of London to Windsor.\n\nThe George VI Memorial Chapel in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, where the Queen's father and mother were interred.

However, other Scottish National Party figures including former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill have said it is \"perfectly feasible\" that Downing Street will refuse to grant the powers. The British government has not yet given a definitive answer to the question.\n\nIt is proposed at this stage that the same question as in 2014, \"should Scotland be an independent country?\" would be used in a second referendum although a variation has not been ruled out after the consultation. Scotland's constitutional future would be decided by a simple majority, with no minimum turnout threshold.\n\nScottish leader prepares for pre-Brexit independence vote\n\nAs in 2014, 16 and 17-year-olds would be eligible to vote, as would European Union citizens. Minor changes to 2014 are proposed around absent voting arrangements and permitted participants.\n\nThe consultation asks about technical aspects of the bill, not whether a repeat referendum should be held.\n\nSturgeon has said she will move for a second referendum if she concludes independence is the best or only way to protect Scotland's interests, after the United Kingdom's decision to quit the EU.\n\nIn the June referendum, 52% of voters voted to leave the European Union.\n\nThe first minister, in the foreword to the consultation document, said that the Scottish National Party has been elected on a \"clear mandate\" that it should have the right to hold a referendum, if there was a \"significant and material change in circumstances\" to 2014 such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will.\n\nShe added: \"Scotland is now faced with one of the specific scenarios in which this government pledged that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold an independence referendum.\n\nBritain: No special migration deal for Scotland after Brexit\n\n\"The UK Government’s recent statements on its approach to leaving the EU raise serious concerns for the Scottish Government. We face unacceptable risks to our democratic, economic and social interests and to the right of the Scottish Parliament to have its say.\n\n\"Indeed those statements contradict the assurances given before the independence referendum in 2014 that Scotland is an equal partner within the UK and that a vote against independence would secure our EU membership.\n\n\"For many people, this approach will be evidence of a wider democratic deficit within the UK, where decisions about Scotland are too often taken against the wishes of people who live here.\"\n\nShe added: \"This government remains willing to work with the UK Government to negotiate a future relationship with Europe that is in line with the views of the overwhelming majority of the Scottish people and which works for the United Kingdom as a whole.\"\n\nThe 2014, the independence referendum was defeated 55% to 45%, meaning Scotland remained a part of the United Kingdom.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY.

And he did it in one of the “most spectacular matches” ever witnessed at Ally Pally.\n\n‘Leapt round the stage like a madman’\n\nWith 16 ranking titles between them, Smith and Van Gerwen have been the “best two players on the planet” throughout the last 12 months, said Aaron Bower in The Guardian. “We hoped this final”, the “most mouthwatering” in years on paper, “would deliver”, he added. “And how they delivered.” This was a meeting of the “two finest tungsten technicians”.\n\nWhen he ended his major title duck in November by winning the Grand Slam of Darts, Smith said he would “eventually be a world champion”. And now he has the ambition to do what Van Gerwen has done and “take over” this sport. “It sounds amazing – world champion,” he told Sky Sports. “I finally took a chance that I didn’t deserve. I want to apologise to Michael as I’ve been in his position before.”\n\nAfter sealing the win, Smith “could not hold back the tears” as he “leapt round the stage like a madman”, Maul added in The Sun. And he celebrated with his family “like Pat Cash at 1987 Wimbledon”.\n\nFrom a sporting memory “it’s the greatest ever”, Smith said of his victory. “I don’t think that will ever be topped. Even if I won a second [world title], it will never top how I just felt then.”\n\nSmith delivers the ‘magical nine’\n\nVan Gerwen had “cruised through” his quarter-final and semi-final ties “without dropping a set”, said BBC Sport. After taking the opener in this “classic final”, it “needed something special” to end his run of 14 successive victorious sets.\n\nSmith “duly delivered” in a final which featured the “greatest leg of darts the world will ever see”, Bower added in The Guardian. In the third leg of the second set Smith “pinned the perfect nine-dart leg” – but only after Van Gerwen had missed double 12 for a nine-darter of his own. “I thought I’d give the crowd what they deserved and they got one, the magical nine,” Smith said.\n\nOn social media video clips of the nine-darter went viral with fans left bewildered by the stunning feat. The PDC’s video on Twitter has already had more than 8m views. In the commentary box Sky Sports’s Wayne Mardle “lost his voice” as he “provided the soundtrack” for one of the greatest moments in darts history, said Ben Parsons in The Mirror. Going “berserk” as he called the nine-dart attempts, Mardle expressed the emotions of darts fans across the globe. “That is the most amazing leg of darts you will ever see!” Mardle said after Smith hit 141. “I can’t speak, I can’t speak!”\n\nHow fans reacted to the ‘greatest leg’\n\nSmith “realised all his darting dreams at once” as he laid his hands on the Sid Waddell trophy, claimed the £500,000 cheque and became the No.1 player on the planet, said Parsons in The Mirror. In what will be considered “one of the sporting moments of 2023”, the man from St Helens “made fans lose their minds” by nailing the perfect nine.

He is currently on loan to Sparta Prague from the Spanish side Getafe. Since joining Sparta Prague in August, he has made 10 league appearances, said the BBC. He has scored once and provided one assist.\n\nJankto has so far spent most of his club career in Italy with Udinese, Ascoli and Sampdoria. He then signed for Getafe in 2021.

It received 100,000 likes in the same period on Instagram.\n\nSparta Prague released a statement in support of the player, which read: “Jakub Jankto spoke openly about his sexual orientation with the club’s management, coach and teammates some time ago.\n\n“No further comments.

The American will join five other players in relinquishing their membership of the US tour to join LIV.\n\nOthers, like Phil Mickelson and Graeme McDowell, have resisted quitting the official tour but face potential sanctions for their involvement with the new event. The Times reported they could face punishments ranging from “temporary suspensions or fines” to complete bans “depending on the level of involvement”.\n\nHigh-profile players such as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods have openly opposed the tournament but the likes of European Ryder Cup stars Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Sergio García are playing in the inaugural Centurion Club event, and The Telegraph reported that American major winners Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed have signed up and will play in the second event, starting in Portland on 3 July.\n\nEye-watering sums\n\nBacked by the Saudi government controlled Public Investment Fund and fronted by former Australian pro Greg Norman, the LIV Series is offering eye-watering sums of money to attract participants.\n\nSix-time major champion Mickelson is expected to receive $200m for his participation, while the first event in the series will feature an overall prize pot of $25m, with the winner receiving $4m. For contrast, the winner of the US Masters tournament in 2022 received $2.7m from a prize pot of $15m.\n\nLIV’s monetary power, as well as the disruption to the traditional calendar, leaves golf “mired in turmoil” and with uncertainty “it has never encountered before”, said Fox Sports. Players, and LIV frontman Norman, have refused to earnestly engage in questions around Saudi-sportswashing – the country's attempt to “gain legitimacy on the world stage and deflect from [its] human rights violations”, as The Times said.\n\n“Just tell us it’s the money,” said Brendan Quinn in The Athletic. “Stop telling us you’re excited to play what amounts to video game golf.” Weir agreed, writing for Sky Sports: “There’s one motive and one motive alone for these players. Money.”\n\nFans will decide\n\nUltimately the success of LIV will rely on how many people consume it, though the tournament will initially only be streamed on the organisers’ website and on Youtube and Facebook. “Fans must choose whether this is a black eye for golf,” said Rogers on Fox Sports.\n\nThree-time major winner Padraig Harrington, though, believes controversy around Saudi money will pass as the LIV series attracts viewers. “As much as it’s being used as a stick to beat those guys and it’s a big issue for anyone who is going,” Harrington said, “clearly time will pass,” Sports Illustrated reported.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/tennis/955561/australia-expects-ashleigh-barty-melbourne-grand-slam", "title": "Australia expects: Ashleigh Barty eyes history at Melbourne grand ...", "text": "Ashleigh Barty, the world No.1 women’s tennis player, has become the first Australian in 42 years to reach the women’s singles final of the Australian Open grand slam.

Her 121 total weeks are seventh on the all-time list.\n\nSteve Simon, chief executive of the WTA, praised Barty for being the “ultimate competitor” who always led by example through the “unwavering professionalism and sportsmanship” she brought to every match. “With her accomplishments at the grand slams, WTA Finals, and reaching the pinnacle ranking of No.1 in the world, she has clearly established herself as one of the great champions of the WTA,” he said.\n\nHow the tennis world reacted on social media\n\nAsh, what can I say, you know I have tears right?

It’s only April but the 25-year-old American has already climbed to the top spot on the Official Golf World Rankings, having won three out of five starts on the PGA Tour. Then on Sunday he won his fourth tournament of the season, which was the biggest of them all – the Masters, his first career major title.\n\nAt Augusta National Scheffler showed why he’s the No.1 golfer in the world and “cemented his place as the dominant force in the men’s game”, said Jonathan Jurejko on BBC Sport. Scheffler claimed the Green Jacket, Masters trophy and the $2.7m (£2m) winners’ purse with a one-under 71 in the final round, finishing on ten-under, three shots clear of Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy.\n\nScheffler held a three-shot overnight lead going into Sunday’s final round of the first major of the year. And afterwards he revealed that he “cried like a baby” on the morning of the final round because “he doubted if he was ready to win one of the sport’s most iconic tournaments”, the BBC added.\n\nIn his post-tournament speech, Scheffler said that the first time he thought of winning was “probably Friday in the afternoon”. When asked how it felt to be the Masters champion, he added: “I want to go home! I’m pretty tired right now – I’m really at a loss for words. I can’t thank my family enough – they’ve made many sacrifices over the years. To have the honour of winning the tournament and to have my family with me was incredible.”\n\nWith this victory, Scheffler becomes the first player to win four times in a six-start stretch on the PGA Tour since Jason Day in 2015. He becomes the sixth player to win in his first PGA Tour start as world No.1 and sixth world No.1 to win the Masters.\n\n‘Standout player at every single level’\n\nThe last two months have been “transformative” for Scheffler, who in February “didn’t have a PGA Tour victory to his name”, said Ben Morse on CNN. Now in the “form of his life”, over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Scheffler produced “some excellent golf” and refused to “falter under the pressure of being the tournament’s leader for nearly three days”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/958783/operation-stop-kylian-mbappe-kyle-walker-england-fifa-world-cup", "title": "'Operation stop Mbappé': how Kyle Walker can be England's 'secret ...", "text": "Gareth Southgate has taken England to the semi-finals and final of two major championships during his six years as head coach. It’s an impressive record, but now the Three Lions are preparing for what is perhaps the biggest challenge of his tenure yet – a World Cup quarter-final against France, the reigning champions.\n\n“Make no mistake”, this last-eight clash will be a “gargantuan test” for Southgate’s team, said Martin Samuel in the Daily Mail. France “could well be the best team here” in Qatar, and are certainly the “best of the European contingent”.\n\nDidier Deschamps’s world champions are in “free-scoring form”, said Nick Ames in The Guardian, but they have been “ravaged by injuries” and are “unbalanced in some areas”. They do, however, possess one “significant” strength: Kylian Mbappé, the World Cup’s top scorer, with five goals so far. As he showed in the last-16 against Poland, the 23-year-old can “illuminate the dreariest of games in an instant”.\n\nIf England are to knock out the holders and reach the semi-finals, they will have to nullify the threat of France’s talented attack. “Operation stop Mbappé” was one of the headlines on the front page of the i newspaper this morning, a theme that has been a major talking point ahead of Saturday’s match at the Al Bayt Stadium.\n\n‘Right, let’s have a race’\n\nThe Three Lions looked “mightily impressive” in their 3-0 win over Senegal in the round of 16, said Kobe Tong on GiveMeSport. “But it’s one thing to beat the champions of Africa and another thing to beat the champions of the world.” And one of the “biggest threats” that Southgate’s men will face is the “sheer amount of pace” that France boast out wide.\n\nEngland’s defence have been in decent form in Qatar, conceding just two goals in four games. However, they will need to be at their very best against the likes of Mbappé, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé – who all offer different traits in Les Bleus’s front-line.\n\nMbappé “may not get it all his own way” though, said Lewis Winter in the Daily Express, because Southgate and England have their own “secret weapon” – Manchester City defender Kyle Walker. Former England striker Theo Walcott has argued that while the French star is a “different beast”, he could “struggle” against Walker’s “physicality”.\n\nEx-England defenders Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville agreed that Walker’s pace is key for the Three Lions’s hopes. He’s the “only defender on the planet” right now that will “stand there and go to Mbappé, ‘right, 1-v-1, let’s have a race’”, Ferdinand said on his Vibe with Five YouTube show.\n\nIn terms of “physicality, pace and experience”, Neville couldn’t think of anyone better able to match Mbappé than 32-year-old Walker. “That’s not to say he’ll keep him quiet for 90 minutes as Mbappé is sensational and special,” he said on Sky Sports. “But we have a chance as Walker can match him in certain areas.”\n\nWhatever happens in this World Cup quarter-final, it promises to be a “game of a lifetime”, Neville added. “They don’t come around in your life very often. They are big moments. I can’t wait.”\n\nEngland vs. France takes place on Saturday at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, Qatar.

In its September issue, the fashion magazine said the 40-year-old would bid farewell to tennis “on her own terms – and in her own words”.\n\nIn fact retirement is not a term that she’s ever liked, “it doesn’t feel like a modern word to me”, she wrote. “I’ve been thinking of this as a transition. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\nA few years ago Williams “quietly started” Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, she started a family. “I want to grow that family.”\n\n‘I should have had 30-plus slams’\n\nIt’s “almost the end of an era”, said Amy Lofthouse on BBC Sport. As “one of the greatest tennis players of all time” and a “sporting icon”, it will be “difficult to imagine tennis without the American legend”, who has won “all there is to win” during her 27-year career.\n\nA winner of 23 grand slam singles titles in the open era, Williams is just one behind the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court. In her essay she suggested that the 2022 US Open, which starts on 29 August, will be her farewell event. It was in New York, as a “braided 17-year-old phenomenon”, where she lifted the family’s “first major title” in 1999, said Bryan Armen Graham in The Guardian. Her older sister Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion, won the US Open major a year later and in 2001.\n\nWithin reach of Court’s 24 slams, Williams would “be lying” if she said she didn’t want that record. “Obviously I do,” she wrote. “But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams.”\n\nWith 23 slams and 73 career titles, Williams has “set the marker that matters”, said Tumaini Carayol in The Guardian. “No asterisks needed”, her tennis legacy “goes far beyond statistics”.\n\nIn Vogue’s September issue, @serenawilliams prepares to say farewell to tennis on her own terms and in her own words. “It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine,” she says. “I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next” https://t.co/6Zr0UXVTH1 pic.twitter.com/YtGtcc18a9 — Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) August 9, 2022\n\n‘It hurts like a 120mph serve to the stomach’\n\nWilliams’ retirement will be “a crushing loss” for tennis, said Johnny Oleksinski in the New York Post. “Without a doubt”, she is a “once-in-a-generation athlete” on the “same godlike level” as Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James or Tom Brady. “The sports world will be a lot less ferocious or fascinating without her.” We all knew this sad day was coming, but it “still hurts like a 120-miles-per-hour serve to the stomach”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/formula-1/955366/lewis-hamilton-future-could-he-retire-from-f1", "title": "Lewis Hamilton's future: could he retire from F1? | The Week UK", "text": "There will be major changes for Formula 1 in 2022 as a new generation of cars hit the track and a record 23 races feature on the schedule. However, with just six weeks to go until the first pre-season test in Barcelona, the sport could yet have to deal with the biggest change of all: the possibility of Lewis Hamilton not being on the grid.\n\nFollowing the 2021 season’s highly-contentious last race – and lap – in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton’s future in F1 remains “unclear”, Sky Sports reported. The British driver missed out on winning a record-breaking eighth world title as Max Verstappen won his first in “hugely controversial circumstances”.\n\nHamilton’s Mercedes team withdrew their appeal against the result as governing body the FIA “pledged an investigation into the events surrounding the Safety Car procedures”, the broadcaster said. And the FIA’s Abu Dhabi investigation is understood to be “key” to the resolution of Hamilton’s future.\n\nMercedes want to see something “tangible”, said Sky Sports News’ Craig Slater. “It’s been put to me like this: the longer this drags on then the worse the Lewis Hamilton situation is, and that is from a senior source.”\n\n‘He is a man with clear values’\n\nAfter the 2021 season finale, Hamilton made a “cryptic reference” when speaking with Jenson Button in the post-race interview. “We gave it everything and never gave up and that’s the most important thing,” he said. “We’ll see about next year.”\n\nHowever, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last month said the driver would “never overcome the pain and the distress” that was caused at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and he indicated that it was not a certainty the 37-year-old would be back in 2022, Wheels24 reported.\n\nWolff “very much” hopes that Hamilton continues racing, because he is the “greatest driver of all time”. But when asked if the Brit could retire, Wolff added: “As a racer his heart will say I need to continue because he’s at the peak of his game. But we have to overcome the pain that was caused upon him. He is a man with clear values.”\n\nFIA boss ‘confident’ Hamilton will return\n\nHamilton has not posted anything on his social media channels since before the race in Abu Dhabi and this has prompted suggestions of retirement in some circles.\n\nBut racing fans across the globe may “breathe a sigh of relief”, after Mercedes “dropped a huge hint” that their driver will be on the grid in 2022, the Daily Mirror reported. On 2 January Mercedes tweeted an image of Hamilton along with the caption: “Adversity causes some to break; others to break records.”\n\nMohammed Ben Sulayem, the new FIA president, disagreed with suggestions Hamilton would retire. “No, I don’t think he will [quit],” he said. “I’ll ask your question, did Lewis declare that he’s not going to race? No. Exactly. Being a driver, you declare yourself, you don’t let the rumours [talk].”\n\nBen Sulayem is “confident” that Hamilton will return as he is a “big part of motorsport” and of F1. “The new era [can add to] Lewis’s wins and achievements, and also Verstappen is there,” he added. “I am very confident that you will see a very challenging Formula 1 season next year.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}]}

He is currently on loan to Sparta Prague from the Spanish side Getafe. Since joining Sparta Prague in August, he has made 10 league appearances, said the BBC. He has scored once and provided one assist.\n\nJankto has so far spent most of his club career in Italy with Udinese, Ascoli and Sampdoria. He then signed for Getafe in 2021.

They wanted it to be the beginning of a shift, a way of showing queer people that they have the opportunity \"to be open and be authentic to themselves and everything that makes them unique, and still achieve success in sport.\"\n\nWith a brilliant performance at Capital Indoor Stadium on Friday, LeDuc did just that.\n\nSkating with partner Ashley Cain-Gribble in the short program of the pairs event, LeDuc became the first openly nonbinary athlete to compete at the Winter Olympics – a historic step for LGBTQ representation and visibility at the Games.\n\nOLYMPIC NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to stay up to date on all things Beijing Olympics\n\nBEIJING TEXT UPDATES: Get behind-the-scenes access to the Tokyo Olympics\n\n\"I know for me, being openly nonbinary is only possible because amazing queer people have come before me and laid the groundwork for me,\" LeDuc, 31, said Friday night. \"So now I want to do that for others to come after, as well.\"\n\nLeDuc's debut in Beijing follows that of Quinn, a women's soccer player who became the first openly transgender and nonbinary person to win an Olympic medal when they earned gold with Canada at the most recent Summer Games.\n\nAccording to GLAAD and Outsports, a website that covers LGBTQ issues and personalities in sports, LeDuc is one of at least 32 out LGBTQ athletes competing in the Beijing Games. There were 15 out athletes at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang.\n\n\"I think it’s amazing,\" fellow figure skater Jason Brown, who came out as gay last summer, said of the number of LGBTQ athletes competing in Beijing.\n\n\"The fact that visibility is just growing, for other people to come, is huge. I’m so proud to be a part of that. And I just feel so lucky to everybody that came before me.\"\n\nLeDuc has long echoed that sentiment. An Iowa native, they first told their parents at 18 that they were gay, then came out as nonbinary more than a decade later. The term encompasses people whose gender identity and/or gender expression falls outside the \"man\" and \"woman\" binary.\n\nAt the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, LeDuc spoke at length about struggling to portray masculinity in figure skating, especially in a discipline like pairs where skaters often take on traditional masculine and feminine roles. It just felt \"forced,\" they said.\n\n\"It was never authentic to me,\" LeDuc said. \"When I was finally given the tools and shown the example that I can exist outside of that, it all made sense. I finally felt whole in myself.\"\n\nWhile feeling that there's too much of a focus placed on physical characteristics when discussing gender expression, LeDuc also noted that they portray elements of both masculinity and femininity. They have a beard, for instance, but wear makeup during competition.\n\nLeDuc found a perfect match in 2016 with Cain-Gribble, a former singles skater who has been open about facing body shaming earlier in a career that almost forced her into retirement. While LeDuc aims to prove that athletes shouldn't be limited by their gender expression, Cain-Gribble hopes to show they shouldn't be limited by body type.\n\n\"There is a body stereotype, still,\" she said last month. \"And we're trying to definitely fight that.\"\n\nTogether, LeDuc and Cain-Gribble have won two national championships. They are also trying to break the mold of traditional pairs skating, which Cain-Gribble has described as \"the girl being lifted and the male partner just kind of standing there and lifting them.\"\n\nIt's why, in their short program Friday night set to \"The White Crow\" by Ilan Eshkeri, they displayed equal skating skills – performing many of the same moves, in unison, rather than filling stereotypical gender roles. They were rewarded with a score of 74.13, good for seventh place. The competition will continue with the long program Saturday night.\n\n\"I think both Ashley and I have had to overcome so many different things – so many times when people have told us no, or that we don't belong,\" LeDuc said Friday. \"So for both Ashley and I, we had something to prove today, I think. And hopefully people watching us feel that there is space for them to come into figure skating, and for them to be able to celebrate what makes them unique and different.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2021/09/02/bryan-ruby-only-active-professional-baseball-player-out-gay/8244571002/", "title": "Bryan Ruby becomes only active professional baseball player out as ...", "text": "Bryan Ruby first started to realize he was different at 14 years old. That's when the hiding began. Along with the darkness.\n\nHe found emotional refuge in two different parts of his identity. He's a professional baseball player, a member of the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, which makes him much closer to a journeyman than a major-leaguer. And he's a country music songwriter, having written two songs that reached the charts, plus countless ballads in his notebook.\n\nYet it's Ruby's hidden part of his identity that he now believes can have the biggest impact, partially because it's so foreign to the worlds of baseball and country music.\n\nRuby is a gay man, the only active professional baseball player at any level to be publicly out.\n\n\"I kept thinking about the little 14-year-old me, who was scared because I'm a baseball player who loved country music,\" Ruby, 25, told USA TODAY Sports. \"Those are worlds where people like me are told they can't belong. I'm not a hot-shot prospect. But today, you can't find a single active baseball player who is out publicly. I want to help create a world where future generations of baseball players don't have to sacrifice authenticity or who they really are to play the game they love.\"\n\nHis coming out follows a summer in which Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib and Nashville Predators prospect Luke Prokop also came out as gay. After years of no actively out players in men's professional sports, now there are three.\n\nPlaying the guitar in his bedroom in recent months, with posters of Dierks Bentley and Cal Ripken Jr. hanging in the background, Ruby sang a song he's co-written that seems especially relevant given his purpose behind coming out.\n\n\"If that white line ever gets lonely, if the nights get a little too cold, if it don't work out, if you have your doubts, you've got a place to go.\"\n\nRuby's goal is clear: to help others who are forced to hide their identity, too.\n\n\"Being closeted for basically 10 years, it was a struggle the whole time,\" he said. \"I used to hate myself. Hate how I felt. I'd ask why am I feeling this way?\"\n\n\"I kept having people tell me, 'Be very cautious of who you tell' or 'They don't need to know your personal life.' The best way to describe the hiding as an athlete is like you're running with a weighted vest on,\" he said. \"It's on all day and you can't take it off. I've been gradually taking that weight off.\"\n\nFactor in Ruby's second career in Nashville – where he moonlights writing hits for Hayden Joseph and Xavier Joseph – and you've got two worlds that scream he's straight.\n\n“As a country music songwriter, at first I thought being gay was a huge weakness,” said Ruby, who will be showcased in the upcoming documentary, \"Out in Nashville.\" “There’s this genre about drinking beer and hooking up with girls in the back of the truck. Then I realized that I can bring something different to the table. Love songs don’t need to be gay or straight. And I’ve been able to write my best songs by being authentic.”\n\nRuby told his family and close friends he was gay four years ago, then his teammates this summer. But being out to the world publicly was the last step.\n\nRuby pauses: \"But I don't like the connotation to, 'coming out.' Because it's more like 'inviting in.' \"\n\nA supportive family, 'such courage'\n\nRuby trembled over the phone sitting parked in his black Dodge Ram truck with the wind blowing in the background.\n\n\"Mom, it's me ... I got a spot.\"\n\nTears flowed down his cheeks as he told his family in March that he made the Volcanoes roster.\n\nA year ago, the future was uncertain for Ruby and the Volcanoes. A Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants from 1997 to 2020, the Volcanoes were not one of the teams invited to join Major League Baseball's newly created minor league structure. They eventually formed the Mavericks Independent League with three other teams based in the Salem, Oregon area.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruby did not play last year, along with hundreds of other farmhands when minor league seasons at all levels were canceled because of COVD-19.\n\n\"I didn't think I'd ever play (pro) baseball again,\" said Ruby, who has kept his career going internationally in six countries that include Austria, Chile, Germany, Guatemala, Peru, and Switzerland – all after a standout career at Vassar College. \"I told myself I’d go to the end of the earth if it meant I could keep my baseball career alive. ...I've been a baseball player since I was seven or eight, way before I knew I was gay. It's the lens through which I see the world.\"\n\nRuby's mother, Lauren, remembers her son's Little League days – a childhood he said he couldn't have scripted more perfect. But as puberty hit and his friends were growing more attracted to girls, he started to isolate and develop self-hatred at his feelings for guys.\n\n\"When Bryan told me he was gay I was shocked actually,\" Lauren Ruby said of the revelation when Bryan was 21. \"I didn’t see it coming. Mostly because Bryan did a really good job of hiding it. I took several weeks of needing to change my reality from my fantasy of what I thought Bryan’s life was going to be. It was heartbreaking to know he was suffering for so long. I was scared for him because people can be so close-minded and hateful. And the male sports world can be very homophobic with degrading banter. I wanted to protect him from all of that.\"\n\nBryan was terrified to tell his father, Jon, a star high school quarterback who also played Division I baseball. \"I shocked my Mom, but my Dad shocked me because he sort of suspected it,\" Bryan said. \"Then he sort of helped my Mom come along.\"\n\n\"When your son sits there and bares his soul,\" Jon Ruby said, \"you just want him to be happy, and it hits you: what do you want for your kids? To go out into the world and be the best version of themselves. He has so much to offer the world with baseball and music. And he has such conviction ...\"\n\n\"Such courage,\" his mother gently interrupts.\n\n\"I grew up in a culture where homosexuality was taboo,\" Jon, a baseball coach at Friends' Central High School in Philadelphia, said. \"I had an unusual look into that culture, though, because my brother's gay. He came out to me when he was 22, and it changed my whole perspective. All of the sudden, the (gay) slurs that I was hearing resonated much differently. It heightened my awareness.\"\n\nThat same type of familial coincidence happened to Ruby when he was in the process of coming out to his teammates this year.\n\nGabriel Cotto, the Volcanoes' catcher, said he never would've pictured Ruby as gay. But Cotto immediately embraced Ruby once he told him because his own father is gay.\n\n\"I grew up with two Dads and we were just like a regular family,\" Cotto said. \"But I used to get bullied and in fights growing up because my pops is gay. When Ruby told me, I just had so much respect for him. It made our friendship closer.\"\n\nWhy 'voices matter'\n\nRuby wears his lucky shoes in just about every game. They've got rainbow shoelaces in them now. He got the cleats from his mentor and friend, Billy Bean, the MLB vice president and special assistant to the commissioner.\n\nBean played in the major leagues as an outfielder for nearly a decade and came out as gay himself after his retirement in the 1990s. Despite a paucity of publicly out active players – Milwaukee Brewers minor leaguer David Denson came out in 2015 and retired shortly thereafter – Bean has been a visible presence and confidant for closeted MLB players.\n\nRuby wrote Bean a letter in 2018, and Ruby still has Bean's response letter framed on his wall.\n\n\"I didn't even put my last name or address,\" said Ruby. \"He's someone who sits right next to the MLB commissioner and he has my back. I've worn his cleats everywhere I've played – on three different continents. I look down at them, and know I have support.\n\n\"I didn't think about the symbolic meaning until recently, of me wearing his shoes and what I'm doing (going public).\"\n\n\"The beauty of it for Bryan is that he's not playing to only become a big leaguer,\" Bean told USA TODAY Sports. \"He's playing because he loves the game. I imagine he'll be proud of himself when he's 40 years old in his country music career knowing what he's doing for baseball. I couldn't be prouder, and I definitely think Bryan's story is a stepping stone in the right direction.\"\n\nA stepping stone that could have a domino effect for other gay professional athletes. Bean said that the decision of a closeted player to come out or not is \"not as simple as people want to make it. There are so many considerations.\"\n\nRuby ran the gamut in those considerations before telling his team.\n\n\"You must do well with the ladies, huh, man?\" The questions in the locker room were aplenty. His typical answer: \"I'm in a relationship.\" True, but the answer evaded the discomfort of revealing his relationship with his boyfriend, Max, of a year and a half.\n\n\"It's not all super rosy,\" Ruby said.\n\nOlder coaches from past generations have been subtly homophobic, urging him to keep his sexual orientation a secret or to be with a woman to keep up a front. Teammates over the years have slipped out gay slurs. And opponents can be the worst of them all, shooting out sexual barbs to intimidate.\n\nGehrig Richins, the Volcanoes' assistant coach, said he imagines teammates being protective of Ruby if gay slurs were to persist once he's out publicly. \"It's almost better if we know as a team,\" Richins said. \"Because then there's a sense of respect and guys can watch their language to avoid harm. We can have his back.\"\n\nBut therein is part of the paradox of being closeted: Homophobic language begets fear. Then fear keeps athletes closeted and, in turn, teammates aren't as likely to check their offensive language at the door.\n\n\"Bryan understands that until there's more people like him or Carl Nassib (out), voices matter,\" Bean said. \"The expectation would be to mute your life off the field and hide. Putting yourself in discomfort to make others comfortable. But we embrace Clayton Kershaw's family since it shows us he's human.\"\n\nRuby called Nassib and Prokop \"heroes\" and said he even bought his first-ever NFL jersey the day after Nassib came out.\n\n\"Each time somebody comes out in industries where queer people have not been historically represented in the mainstream,\" Ruby said, \"it helps to crumble the myth that you can't be yourself. But we're in the 2020s. It's about damn time for this.\n\n\"If I can help just one person from this, then that’s greater than any single hit or home run or win that I ever get on the field.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/football/josh-cavallo-attitude-man-of-the-year-award-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Josh Cavallo: Gay Australian footballer says World Cup shouldn't be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt has been almost a year since Josh Cavallo announced he is gay, but even now he still struggles to comprehend the far-reaching impact his announcement has had – especially as he has begun to speak out on major issues, notably the Qatar World Cup.\n\nSince making that life-changing decision in October 2021, Cavallo has become one of the most recognizable names and faces in world football, as well as becoming something of an icon.\n\nThe Adelaide United star was recently named “Man of the Year” at an awards ceremony hosted by Attitude Magazine, Europe’s largest LGBTQ magazine publication. It was the culmination of a whirlwind year that started with what he describes as the beginning of a new chapter in his life.\n\n“It was huge for me,” Cavallo tells CNN Sport. “To come out, it was a lot for my family, my friends and it was a huge step forward.\n\n“I just didn’t know what to expect … and I just took it as best as I could and I ran with it, and this is who I am.\n\n“I didn’t want to hide anymore and I wanted to show everyone who Josh Cavallo the person is. To see that I’m affecting and helping people in their everyday lives.\n\n“I’m walking in the streets of London and getting stopped. I’ve only been to London twice now and I’m like: ‘Wow, I’m all the way from Australia and what I did was via social media,’ and to see the impact it’s had from people on the other side of the globe is absolutely phenomenal.”\n\nJosh Cavallo publicly announced he was gay in October 2021. Jason McCawley/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nA year on, Cavallo remains the only openly gay top-flight male footballer in the world – he plays for Adelaide United in Australia’s A League – but his decision inspired Jake Daniels, a forward for English second division club Blackpool, to come out in May of this year.\n\nCavallo admits he did not know what the reaction would be to his announcement, and even though there have been negative comments, for every hateful message he says he receives, there are 100 supportive ones.\n\nThough he experienced concerns ahead of publicly coming out, he says the overwhelming feeling was being “emotionally pleased” that he would no longer be “hiding and living in that fear.”\n\n“It was just the uncertainty, seeing that there was no active gay footballer that’s come out before and there was no plan with it,” he recalls.\n\n“I didn’t know what to expect, I didn’t know how people were going to react, there was a lot of uncertainty and that’s something that I struggled with growing up and why it took me so long to become the person I am.\n\n“I wanted to be that person that, you know, people look at now and say: ‘Oh my God, that’s so cool. I want to do that. I want to do what Josh is doing,’ and I want it to be inclusive and quite influential.\n\n“It’s great to see the people now in the football industry, the referees and people in sport coming out and referring to my story and saying I had an influence on them. It’s just absolutely phenomenal that it’s had that impact.”\n\n\"To see that we're heading to a country (Qatar) that's criminalizing people like myself ... It's quite concerning,\" says Cavallo of the 2022 World Cup. Ashley Feder/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\n‘A long way to go’\n\nCavallo names Lionel Messi as one of his inspirations on the pitch growing up, but he says he looked up to Justin Fashanu for inspiration in his personal life.\n\nFashanu became the first openly gay professional footballer after coming out in 1990 while playing in the English top flight, but the backlash he suffered eventually led him to take his own life eight years later.\n\n“To see that story end in such a sad way, it did hurt me and it was like I didn’t want people to get that perspective on it,” says Cavallo.\n\n“It is so great to be gay. It is so great to be a footballer and to be comfortable in your own skin. Why aren’t we embracing that? And I knew I had the chance to change that.”\n\nEarlier this month, former Spain internationals Iker Casillas and Carles Puyol were widely criticized after the former posted a tweet claiming he was gay.\n\nIn a now deleted post on his official Twitter account, Casillas wrote: “I hope I’ll be respected: I’m gay.” In response, former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol wrote: “The time has come to tell our story, Iker.”\n\nCasillas, who has two children with his former wife, deleted the post shortly after it was sent and later apologized, as did Puyol. The original tweet came amid gossip within Spanish media which has linked Casillas to multiple women since his divorce.\n\nCavallo criticized Puyol and Casillas for their tweets. Sarah Reed/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nCavallo, who tweeted criticism of the the pair at the time, says the trivialization of such an important topic does a disservice to those around the world who face persecution for their sexuality.\n\n“It’s hard for people to understand when they don’t experience it,” he says.\n\n“You get a lot of messages via social media of people in countries like Qatar and they say: ‘Josh, please help me. I want to come out, I want to be myself but they’re going to criminalize me. I’m going to get the death penalty.\n\n“When you hear stuff like that, it breaks your heart because they’re the things that everyday people go through in these countries.\n\n“There are 69 countries in the world that still criminalize this, so it is a huge, important topic and to see icons of the game making fun out of that and mocking my own tribe, it does hurt me and offend me because there are a lot of people that are fighting for their lives just to be comfortable with who they are in their own skin.”\n\nCavallo says the exchange between Casillas and Puyol proves football still has “got a long way to go” to eradicate homophobia, even if the sport has recently made steps in the right direction.\n\n“Something that could be an exchange of a joke or a mockery is quite hurtful to people like us because we go through our lives so strong, finding our identity of who we are and we finally build up the courage to be who we are and be comfortable in our own skin,” he says.\n\n“Then you see people and legends of the game doing that it is quite hurtful because we look up to these people. These are the people we dream of playing against or playing with alongside.\n\n“So to see people like that do things like that and [make] silly jokes like that is quite hurtful to myself especially and my community.”\n\nCavallo players for Adelaide United in the A-League, Australia's top football division. Sarah Reed/Getty Images\n\nAfter announcing his sexuality last year Cavallo said that he would be “scared” to play in Qatar, where same-sex activity is prohibited.\n\nIn response to Cavallo’s fears at the time, Nasser Al Khater, the chief executive of the tournament’s organizing committee, told CNN: “On the contrary, we welcome him here in the state of Qatar, we welcome him to come and see even prior to the World Cup … Nobody feels threatened here, nobody feels unsafe.”\n\n“I know personally, if I go there, I will be protected because I’m in the public eye,” Cavallo told CNN anchor Amanda Davies.\n\n“But it’s not me that I’m worried about. It’s those ones that are messaging me. It’s those people that aren’t in the public eye that are scared to even be themselves and walk the streets.”\n\n“To see that we’re heading to a country that’s criminalizing people like myself … It’s quite concerning,” added Cavallo.\n\nCNN has reached out to Qatar’s World Cup organizers for comment on Cavallo’s comments, but did not get a response.\n\nEarlier this year, former England international David Beckham become one of the most high-profile ambassadors for the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBeckham has previously been widely criticized for accepting the role and Cavallo says he would like to see Beckham using his platform to support the LGBTQ community instead.\n\n“Look, I don’t know David personally, so I can’t really comment on him and his actions,” Cavallo says. “But having allies in the game is really helpful and when I came out to my changing room, my teammates and to see the reception – every single one of them is an ally of me.\n\n“It made me so proud on the inside and it makes you really emotional because it’s something that I struggled for a long time. So it has such a significant impact on myself and my community.\n\n“If someone like David Beckham with his platform does get around us and becomes an ally that we we are wanting him to be, it is really helpful.\n\n“If he could take that next step and show what he means to the LGBTQ community, that would be fantastic.”", "authors": ["Amanda Davies Richard Parr Matias Grez", "Amanda Davies", "Richard Parr", "Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/sport/isaac-humphries-basketball-australia-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Isaac Humphries: 'I'm essentially starting a new life,' says the only ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs he begins to discuss his sexuality, Isaac Humphries says he is able to lift 25 years of weight off his shoulders.\n\nHumphries, who plays for Melbourne United in Australia’s National Basketball League, had never previously spoken publicly about his sexuality out of fear it would negatively impact his career.\n\nBut now, he says he feels ready to “live my true life” and become the world’s only openly gay man playing top-flight basketball.\n\n“Forever, I thought that being a professional basketball player and gay were mutually exclusive and that I had to hide that side of my life and wasn’t allowed to be who I truly am,” Humphries exclusively tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.\n\n“I’m making the decision to come out … because I believe that I can be who I am in my environment, and I can change the trajectory of how we view being gay in sport.”\n\nIn 2013, former NBA player Jason Collins became the first openly gay athlete in one of the four major North American sports leagues when he came out late in his career.\n\nMore recently, Josh Cavallo, who plays for Adelaide United in Australia’s A League, became the only current openly gay top-flight male soccer player when he came out last year.\n\nAs for Humphries, he says coming to terms with his sexuality drove him to a “very dark” and “very lonely” place before feeling comfortable enough to come out.\n\nHumphries joined Melbourne United in July this year. Ian Knight\n\n“My self-hate, my self-homophobia – everything in that realm was very, very real within my brain and it got so dark that I absolutely thought about exiting this world,” he adds.\n\n“I didn’t want to exist like this, I didn’t think I was allowed to exist like this within my basketball world.”\n\nBut it was his love of basketball that Humphries says saved his life, together with the notion that he could help others in a similar position.\n\nWhile he says his Melbourne United team is “so accepting” and that he feels “honored and privileged” to play basketball, the six-foot, 11-inch center points to the locker-room atmosphere as one of the barriers to feeling comfortable as a gay man in the sport.\n\n“The environment is very masculine,” says Humphries. “It’s not as progressive as the rest of the world. It’s a little bit back in time in those locker rooms. It is talked about quite negatively, the idea of being gay.\n\n“It’s our working environment at the end of the day,” he adds. “We are there every single day and we become a family. Why wouldn’t they want their family members to be comfortable within their environment?”\n\nThe 24-year-old Humphries has experienced different sporting environments across the globe, previously playing Division 1 NCAA college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats before stints in the NBA, the G-League and in Europe.\n\nHumphries, seen facing the Hofstra Pride in December 2016, played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. Rich Graessle/AP\n\nHe returned to Australia to play for the Adelaide 36ers in 2020 and then signed for Melbourne earlier this year.\n\nHumphries has found his form in the past four games, averaging 16.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game, but he says it was while in Los Angeles last year that he was able to feel happy about his sexuality after seeing members of the LGBTQ+ community living in a positive environment for the first time.\n\nHe says taking the decision to come out has changed his life immeasurably.\n\n“I have a weight lifted off my shoulders, 25 years of weight,” says Humphries.\n\n“And it’s not just a little weight – it’s deep-rooted feelings and weight that get to be lifted from you – it’s euphoric. It’s an amazing feeling to just not have to hide every single day, to not have to pretend, to not have to make up stories and lies.\n\n“I’m essentially starting a new life – it’s like a birthday,” he adds. “I can’t believe this is happening; from how dark I was to now is night and day.

So please get used to it, or stay out of football.”\n\nDario Minden was a relatively unknown German football fan before a video of a powerful speech he made was widely shared on social media in September.\n\nFor the majority of the 15-minute talk he spoke in his native German before switching to English, a change he deliberately made, he says, for impact. He wanted the world to hear.\n\nLooking directly at Qatar’s ambassador to Germany, Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani, in a room full of dignitaries and sponsors at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, he said his impactful words. Sitting in the front row, the camera pans briefly to al-Thani and shows him looking at and listening to Minden.\n\n“Football is for everyone,” Minden continued. “It doesn’t matter if you’re lesbian, if you’re gay, it’s for everyone. For the boys, for the girls and for everyone in between … The rule that football is for everyone is so important. We cannot allow you to break it no matter how rich you are. You are more than welcome to join the international football community and, also, of course, to host a big tournament. But in sports, it is how it is. You have to accept the rules.”\n\nWhen Minden finishes, a sprinkling of applause can be heard from some members of the audience.\n\nThat he loves men and has sex with men isn’t an issue in his homeland, but it is in Qatar, a country which from Sunday will be hosting the month-long World Cup, one of sport’s biggest and most lucrative events.\n\nVisitors gather at the FIFA World Cup countdown clock in Doha on October 30, 2022. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, it is undoubtedly a historic event, but it is also one clouded by controversy, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured as the Gulf state prepared for the tournament, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Minden said he would not be going to Qatar and would not be watching the competition on television.\n\n“When we talk about the situation for the LGBTQ+ rights, we mean not only the football tourists, but also the situation before, and especially after, the World Cup,” he said.\n\nAfter the conference, Minden said he spoke privately with the ambassador who he said told him all were welcome to Qatar. But Minden told CNN: “It’s not safe and it’s not right.”\n\n‘Everyone is welcome to Qatar’\n\nA Qatar government official told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country. “Everyone is welcome in Qatar,” the statement read, adding: “Our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”\n\nMeasures were being implemented to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nBut there have been mixed messages with a World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was “damage in the mind,” in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for its advice to any members of the LGBTQ community traveling to Qatar, FIFA referred to a recent public statement made by Fatma Samoura, the the governing body’s secretary general, who said: “No matter your race, your religion, your social and sexual orientation, you are most welcome, and Qataris are ready to receive you with the best hospitality that you can imagine.”\n\n‘I don’t feel comfortable traveling to Qatar’\n\nBut for Englishman Rob Sanderson the respecting of cultures is a “two-way street.”\n\nSanderson is Special Projects Officer of Pride in Football, a network of UK LGBTQ fan groups and one of the supporter groups which joined forces in an open letter to condemn both FIFA and the Supreme Committee, refuting the world governing body and Qatar’s claims that it would be a World Cup for all.\n\nHe is a regular at England internationals and was once the victim of a homophobic assault, he says, at Wembley four years ago, ahead of England’s match against Spain in 2018, when he had an altercation with another fan. The incident was reported to the police and investigated, he says, but there was “insufficient evidence” to proceed, he says. But, largely, he has felt accepted at England matches, where he and his friends hold pride flags aloft celebrating their community and the team.\n\nHowever, he will not be going to Qatar and says if England were to win the tournament, it would be a tarnished trophy.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable traveling out to Qatar and being in any way visible because if I’m visibly showing I’m an LGBT+ football fan, all I’m doing is drawing a target on the back of a local who is anything other than hostile towards me,” the 34-year-old told CNN.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable being used as an excuse for any hostility that would be around after the tournament. It doesn’t sit right with me.”\n\nQatar isn’t the first controversial host of a big sporting event, or even a FIFA World Cup. The last edition was held in Russia, a country which introduced laws in 2013 which banned “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.”\n\nIn the build-up to the 2018 tournament, the UK Foreign Office warned of a “heightened risks” to members of the LGBT community traveling to Russia.\n\nBut while some Pride in Football members went to Russia, Sanderson says, feeling that it was safe as Russian society had previously accepted, in the post-Soviet and pre-Putin era, same-sex relationships, none of its members are going to Qatar. “It’s a totally different environment,” he said.\n\n“They said ‘everyone’s welcome’ but they’ve signed that line off by saying ‘you must respect our culture’.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off on Sunday.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Samoura was sent out to the 32 participating nations but would not divulge the contents.\n\nA joint statement issued earlier this month by fan groups Pride in Football, The Rainbow Wall and Three Lions Pride said: “Let’s be clear, talking about human rights is neither ideological nor political. It is simply asking for decency and the ability for people to be able to watch their teams without fear of abuse.”\n\nA number of European federations also issued a statement saying they would continue to campaign at the tournament on human rights issues and compensation for migrant workers.\n\nUSA's team logo is displayed in a room used for briefings during a training session at the team's training camp in Doha ahead of Qatar 2022.

Wales is one of eight participating European countries at the World Cup supporting the initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to Qatar, the former Real Madrid player said: “We can shed a light on the problems that are going on.”\n\nHowever, Hugo Lloris, captain of France, another team participating in the OneLove campaign, said on Monday he had to “show respect” to Qatar’s culture when asked by reporters about wearing a rainbow-colored armband.\n\n“In France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to play by our rules and respect our culture – and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,” he said.\n\nEngland flew into Qatar on Tuesday on a plane called “Rain Bow” and the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) is displaying a rainbow logo at the team’s training facility in Doha. Talking to reporters, head coach Gregg Berhalter said: “We recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress, but there’s some work still to do.”\n\nThe nearer we get to the kick-off of the opening match between Qatar and Ecuador on November 20, the louder the dissenting voices are becoming and the more visible the signs of support for LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe World Cup, like the Olympics, puts the host country under a global spotlight. Usually, most controversies are forgotten once the sport starts, but such has been the intensity of focus on Qatar’s human rights record that it would be astonishing if all were forgotten by kickoff on Sunday.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe tennis community rallied in support of NBA player Jason Collins announcing he was gay\n\nTennis has a history of prominent players being out\n\nSo far%2C however%2C that has been exclusively women\n\nAs support poured in from the tennis community for NBA player Jason Collins' decision to come out Monday, another question cropped up.\n\nWhere are the gay men in tennis?\n\nAn individual sport with a history of prominent out athletes such as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Amelie Mauresmo — No. 1s all — tennis has been conspicuously without an active openly gay male player in the Open era.\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen male and female players over the past few months — from teenager Laura Robson of Britain to 40-year-old doubles specialist Daniel Nestor of Canada — none expressed discomfort with the idea of a gay peer.\n\nAnd many agreed that simple math suggests they exist. Studies put the percentage of homosexuals in the general population at anywhere from 2%-5%.\n\n\"There's got to be someone who plays tennis who is gay,\" said Sam Querrey, the top-ranked American at No. 19. \"Whether they are on the tour now or up and coming, I'm completely fine with it.\"\n\nStill, most scratched their heads for an explanation.\n\n\"I don't know,\" admitted nine-time Wimbledon singles winner Navratilova after learning about Collins. Navratilova came out during her prime in 1981.\n\nWhile 12-year NBA veteran Collins is the first active male in a major American team sport to declare his same-sex preference, several men have come out in baseball, football and basketball, not to mention a variety of other sports from soccer to figure skating to swimming. Until Collins, 34, nearly all did so after retiring.\n\nSome, such as diver Greg Louganis and relay swimmer Bruce Hayes, both Olympic gold medalists, reached the pinnacle of their sport.\n\nAt least one male player has come out in retirement: Francisco Rodriguez of Paraguay, a former all-American who competed on the pro tour from 2001-2006 and earned a high ranking of No. 373.\n\nRodriguez spoke about being gay in a 2008 article in Out Magazine, saying: \"'If you came out on the tennis tour you would be an outcast.'\"\n\nPro tennis might not be a bastion of tolerance, but it would appear to contain the framework for gay athletes, male or female, to compete with greater ease.\n\nPlayers are independent contractors that control their own destiny (in singles). They do not rely on teammates. General managers or coaches cannot thwart or threaten playing time. It is non-contact. They face no external forces except the opponent on the other side of the net.\n\nIn searching for answers, players offered several possibilities for the lack of openly gay men and scarcity of publicly out women.\n\nSome wondered if a global sport like tennis might actually be less tolerant due to the complicated matrix of nationalities, languages and religions.\n\n\"It's so many different islands,\" said Mike Bryan, who with twin brother Bob is ranked No. 1 in doubles. \"I don't know how everyone feels on that issue.\"\n\nOthers such as American veteran Michael Russell pointed to the timeworn but still persistent idea that locker room etiquette is a deterrent.\n\n\"It's pretty open in the locker room,\" said Russell, who nevertheless said he'd have no problems in that scenario. \"Maybe they'd feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nA few cited the threat economic sanctions in the form of lost endorsements.\n\n\"Trust me, Martina and Billie Jean suffered with the endorsements,\" said 18-time major winner Chris Evert, referring to her rivals and friends Navratilova and King.\n\nEvert said that fear lingers, though that did not seem to affect Frenchwoman Mauresmo, who came out during her run to the Australian Open final as a 19-year-old in 1999 but seemed little penalized during her career.\n\nEvert also argued that staying closeted — or at least not publicly speaking about one's sexuality — stems from a desire for privacy. She noted that some women players continue to travel openly with their partners but have not officially come out.\n\n\"I think a lot of people feel that what they do off the court or off the set is nobody's business,\" she said, comparing professional sports to Hollywood. \"People want to keep one part of their life private.\"\n\nQuerrey wondered if gay men naturally gravitate away from sports and were thus less represented.\n\nRennae Stubbs of Australia, who came out near the end of her career and now is a commentator for television, said macho stereotypes have worked both for and against gay athletes.\n\n\"Most people perceive a lot of women athletes as being gay anyway, which is ridiculous because we all know that's not the case,\" the four-time doubles Grand Slam champion said. \"I think it's a lot more difficult for the guys, and not just tennis.

Qatar won the Asia Cup in 2019, capping off one of the most memorable runs in the tournament’s history, conceding only one goal throughout the tournament.\n\nSeventy percent of the squad that won the trophy came through the academy, and that number has only increased heading into the World Cup.\n\nCoached by Spaniard Felix Sanchez, Qatar will be looking to surprise people and faces a relatively kind group, alongside Ecuador, Senegal and The Netherlands.\n\nQatar will look to spring a surprise at Qatar 2022. Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Winter’ Cup\n\nThe World Cup has always been held in either May, June or July but Qatar 2022 will break away from such tradition – more out of necessity.\n\nTemperatures in Qatar can reach over 40 degrees Celsius over those months so, with this in mind, the tournament was moved to a cooler time.\n\nHowever, winter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees, but organizers hope to combat the heat with multiple methods, such as high-tech cooling systems in stadiums.\n\nThe change in tournament dates has played havoc with some of the biggest domestic leagues in the world.\n\nAll of Europe’s top leagues have had to work a winter break into their schedules, meaning congested fixture lists before and after the tournament.\n\nThis will be the first World Cup played in November and December. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nIslamic country\n\nOne of FIFA’s justifications for awarding Qatar the hosting rights was the ability to take the tournament to a new part of the world.\n\nNone of the 21 previous World Cups have been held in an Islamic country and this month’s tournament will be a chance for the region to celebrate its growing love for the game.\n\nHowever, it undoubtedly raises a few problems that organizers have had to tackle. For many fans, drinking alcohol has, and will continue to be, a big part of the experience of such tournaments.\n\nIn Qatar, though, it’s illegal to be seen drunk in public, which has forced organizers to come up with inventive ways to circumnavigate the issue.\n\nAs a result, alcohol will only be served in designated fan parks around Doha and there will be separate areas for fans to sober up before and after matches.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback World's only openly gay active pro footballer is concerned for LGBTQ community ahead of Qatar 2022 04:39 - Source: CNN\n\nSmallest hosts\n\nAnother question mark around the tournament is how the country will be able to deal with the influx of an expected one million visitors, given it’s the smallest country to host the World Cup, with a population of just under three million.\n\nAs a result, all eight stadiums are in and around Doha, the capital city, and are all within an hour’s drive of each other.\n\nOrganizers say the travel infrastructure – including buses, metro and car hires – will be able to cope with the increased pressure.\n\nOne benefit of the small distances between venues is that fans will be able to see up to two games in one day. Should traffic be kind.\n\nDue to its size, Qatar has also had to be smart with its accommodation.

Tensions quickly escalated as patrons resisted arrest and a growing crowd of bystanders threw bottles and coins at the officers. New York’s gay community, fed up after years of harassment by authorities, broke out in neighborhood riots that went on for three days.\n\nThe uprising became a catalyst for an emerging gay rights movement as organizations such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance were formed, modeled after the civil rights movement and the women’s rights movement. Members held protests, met with political leaders and interrupted public meetings to hold those leaders accountable.

Among those, 24 cases and six deaths were in men who have sex with men.\n\nThe CDC says the outbreak is “primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, including those living with HIV. Recent data show that about half of the cases associated with this outbreak are among Hispanic men. This outbreak is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida.”\n\nMeningococcal disease includes meningitis – infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord – and bloodstream infections. “Meningococcal disease can affect anyone and can be deadly,” the CDC said in its statement.\n\nThe bacteria is spread through sharing respiratory or throat secretions, such as saliva or spit. It normally takes close or lengthy contact, for example kissing or being close to someone who is coughing, to spread the bacteria.\n\nSymptoms include high fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea or vomiting or a dark purple rash, the CDC said. While they can first appear as flu like, they typically get worse very quickly. If someone has these symptoms, they should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nCDC is recommending that gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men get the meningococcal vaccine if they live in Florida, or talk to their health care provider if they are traveling to the state. For those who live with HIV, health officials are emphasizing the importance of routine vaccination.\n\n“Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease is the best way to prevent this serious illness, which can quickly become deadly,” said Dr. José R.

Demands from international leaders for proof of her well-being show that while the Chinese government “has become extremely effective in controlling what the country’s 1.4bn people think and talk about”, influencing the rest of the world “is an entirely different matter”, said The New York Times columnist Li Yuan. Peng went missing for more than two weeks after claiming in a social media post that former vice premier Zhang Gaoli had “forced” her to have sexual relations with him. Amid growing global concern, the 35-year-old tennis champ spoke to the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during a 30-minute video call on Sunday. But while Peng insisted she was safe and well at her home in Beijing, experts told The Telegraph that she might have been abducted under the Chinese regime’s programme of “enforced disappearances”, known officially as RSDL – Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location. People who have criticised the Beijing regime often vanish “for several months, while they are interrogated in a nondescript government building”, said the paper. Many then “re-emerge in society with an outwardly different personality, their plucky mode of resistance replaced by a supine deference to Beijing authorities”. Here are five other high-profile people who have disappeared after falling foul of President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party. Zhao Wei One of China’s most popular actresses, Zhao disappeared from public view in August. Films and TV series in which she appeared were removed without explanation from video platforms, and her name was scrubbed from the Chinese internet. Her profile on social media platform Weibo – where she had accumulated 86 million followers – was also shut down. And social media users were censored when trying to discuss Zhao, the Chinese ambassador for luxury Italian fashion house Fendi. Skip advert Chinese state newspaper Global Times said that Zhao was “widely known as a billionaire investor surrounded with lawsuits” and that she and her husband had previously been banned from “China’s securities markets” for five years for market violations.\n\nBut according to Variety, her disappearance “epitomises many aspects of the Chinese government’s campaign to tear down fandom, celebrity and the driving forces behind them”. “Zhao Wei is like a poster child for what the Communist Party sees as what’s wrong with celebrity culture in China,” Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California specialising in Chinese films and politics, told the magazine. “Going after her without offering a smoking-gun explanation as to why they did it will certainly make other celebrities extremely cautious and proactive in embracing regime goals. “It’s a demonstration that no one, no matter how wealthy or popular, is too big to pursue.” Whether Zhao is now “under house arrest” or just “keeping a low profile” is unclear, said The Guardian. She was reportedly spotted in her hometown in eastern China “posing for a photo” in September. And Chinese internet portal Netease has claimed that Zhao took part in a recent “online shopping event”. Jack Ma The billionaire entrepreneur behind e-commerce giant Alibaba went missing for three months shortly after criticising the Chinese financial system in a controversial speech in October last year. Ma told an audience including senior Chinese officials at the Bund Summit in Shanghai that traditional lenders operated with a “pawn shop” mentality. His criticisms “angered the banking establishment and reportedly reached the attention” of President Xi, said the BBC. China analyst Christina Boutrup told the broadcaster that Ma “apparently crossed the invisible red line for what can be said and done” in Xi’s China. Within a fortnight, Ma and two of his close colleagues were summoned to meet financial regulators, who halted the flotation of Ant Group – his financial technology firm and China's biggest payments provider. Ma wasn’t seen in public again until 20 January, when he took part in an online charity event for rural teachers. According to local media, the tycoon said he had been “studying and thinking, and we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare”.

Paramount Art Center\n\nIt is said that during some early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there, and the man's ghost has forever since haunted the Paramount. In the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except for one man, a guy named Joe. When the other three returned, they found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. And since then, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and some folks even claim to have seen the image of a man appear on occasion. However, he is, by all means, a \"good ghost\" - one who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was here filming his video for \"Achy Breaky Heart,\" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. Between breaks, Billy Ray would talk to Joe, laughing and joking with him, sometimes even asking for his help. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray personally autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each lady put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers.

Since there were so many of Billy Ray, she asked the women to remove their posters since they were all so similar. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down, so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, when the ladies came to work, every single 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered!

There have been images of Soldiers killing each other and those around them. There have been sightings of the dense woods opening where you can see more than you should. The fork in the road rolls and a dense mist appears and disappears as you drive the road. There is also a guardian dog. This dog closely resembles the \"Hounds of Hell\" as described in the Bible. This dog has dead yellow eyes and casts the shadow of a demon when it gets ready to disappear in the triangle at the fork in the road. The dog appears to be injured when it first appears on the side of the road, thus making you want to stop and pick it up, which in turn gives an open invitation to any spirit that is around. When you fail to pick up the dog things begin to change. The dog will walk a few steps and then turn to see if you are still following it. However, if you speed up the dog will speed up, if you slow down it will slow down, if you go to the left it will go to the left, if you go to the right it will go to the right and it is impossible to run over this dog. There have also been sightings of wrecked vehicles with people screaming for help. Due to the period when this cemetery was beginning you will see images of men who were hung from the trees out this road before and after you pass the cemetery. You will also see images of dead family members calling to you. You will also experience a change in the weather when you turn out this road. For instance, it will be raining before you turn on the road, but when you turn on to this road the rain mysteriously stops, and the mist begins until you exit this road where the rain will start again. There are many other things that occur out this road, but you must be very alert and very open to the spirit world and you cannot show fear, or it can take your soul, according to the legend. There are many trapped souls at this location that will mess with you. Make sure you do not have an open invitation of any kind. This means windows rolled up and doors locked. These spirits can also communicate with you through your dreams if you will let them. So, go if you dare just don't show fear! Everyone sees something different when they go to this location so be prepared to be scared.\n\nMarion, Ky. Pilot's Knob\n\nWitches Grave - This cemetery is located off Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five-year-old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800s to the early 1900s for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however, the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However, she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5-year-old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she cannot rest because she is searching for her mother but cannot escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the \"Watcher\" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The \"Watcher\" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However, never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world see something different.\n\nMartin, Ky.

Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.
