Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor. Hear about other gubernatorial firsts 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nAlabama’s Katie Britt, a Republican former aide to retiring Sen. Richard Shelby, will replace him next year, winning election on Tuesday to become the state’s first female US Senator.\n\nDown the ballot, Democratic state Rep. Summer Lee will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida has also elected the youngest-ever House member, 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, now on track to become the first Gen Z candidate to hold federal office.\n\nVirginia’s split decision offers early signals\n\nThree Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.\n\n“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Dan Merica Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/politics/2022-political-instability-fault-lines/index.html", "title": "Why 2022 may bring a new peak of political instability | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nAll year, the principal question looming over the 2022 campaign has been whether Democrats could defy political gravity.\n\nAs we’re nearing the end, the answer appears to be: no, or at least not entirely.\n\nMidterm elections have almost always been bad for the party holding the White House, and they have been especially bad when most Americans are dissatisfied with the economy and the president’s performance. Those conditions are present in force now, with polls showing that most Americans disapprove of how President Joe Biden has handled crime, the border, and especially the economy and inflation. Pessimism about the economy is pervasive. Historically such attitudes have generated big gains up and down the ballot for the party out of the White House – in this case, the Republicans.\n\nThat may be how the election ultimately turns out, especially in House and state legislative races where the individual candidates are less well-known, and many voters are likely to express dissatisfaction with the country’s direction by voting against the party in power. The president’s party, in fact, has lost House seats in all but three midterm elections since the Civil War. If there is a surprise in the House, it’s less likely to come from Democrats maintaining their majority than the Republicans exceeding the average 26 seat midterm gain for the party out of power since World War II.\n\nBut Democrats have remained unexpectedly competitive in the higher-profile Senate and gubernatorial races by focusing attention not only on what Biden has done, but what Republicans might do, with power. Many of these statewide contests have become a “double negative election”: while most voters in the key states consistently say they disapprove of Biden’s job performance, most also say they hold negative personal views about the GOP candidates, many of whom were propelled to their nomination by support from Donald Trump. If Democrats hold the Senate, or hold their own in the top governor races, a principal reason will be the large number of voters who viewed GOP nominees as unqualified, extreme (particularly in their desire to ban or restrict abortion), a threat to democracy, or all of the above. The same dynamic could also save some House Democrats in districts where Biden has fallen well below majority support.\n\nSo many races are so close – within the margin of error in public polls – that the results Tuesday could range from a true red wave to a Democratic sigh of relief. The scary precedent for Democrats is that in wave years almost all of the close races often tip in the same direction – toward the party out of power. A reason for Democratic hope is that in the final surveys, their candidates are consistently running better among all registered voters than among those the pollsters consider most “likely” to vote. That means the party could outperform expectations if even slightly more of its key constituencies (particularly young people) show up than pollsters anticipate – an outcome that groups such as the powerful union Unite Here is trying to achieve with 1,000 canvassers knocking on doors each day in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. “We are in the battle every place,” says Gwen Mills, the union’s secretary-treasurer. “All of [these races] are within the margin of effort.”\n\nIf Republicans take back either chamber this week, it would mark the fifth consecutive election in which a president who went into a midterm with unified control of government had it revoked by the voters. That happened to Donald Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2010, George W. Bush in 2006 and Bill Clinton in 1994.\n\nNo president, in fact, has successfully defended unified control of Congress through a mid-term since Jimmy Carter in 1978 – and he was insulated by the huge Congressional margins Democrats had amassed after Watergate, as well as his party’s strength in what was then still a “solid South” for Democrats. (The sole asterisk on this pattern is that Republicans under George W. Bush regained unified control of Congress in the 2002 midterm held a year after the September 11 attacks after a party switch by a Republican senator in early 2001 flipped control of the chamber to Democrats and broke the GOP’s unified hold on Congress.) A Republican takeover of either or both chambers would extend one of the defining trends of modern politics: Neither party has held the White House and Congress for more than four consecutive years since 1968. That’s a stark departure from most of the 20th century when each side, at different times, cemented lasting control for as long as 14 consecutive years.\n\nNo matter what happens Tuesday, most experts don’t anticipate either party shattering this fragile modern stand-off to establish a lasting edge. “I don’t see either side getting a durable advantage,” says Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science emeritus at the University of California at San Diego. “They are highly polarized parties, and they are very closely balanced overall.”\n\nFrom that angle, Republican gains Tuesday would simply continue a long-standing tendency toward instability in our political system, with the initiative rapidly shifting back and forth between the parties. But the election could also ratchet that instability to a combustible new level. The strong tide behind Republicans virtually guarantees victories for some, maybe many, of the hundreds of candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about the 2020 elections and signaled that they will seek to tilt the electoral rules toward the GOP or simply deny future wins by Democrats. Some of those candidates, if they lose this week, seem likely to emulate Trump after 2020 and refuse to concede, claiming fraud. (Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have each suggested as much already.) The most important legacy of this week’s voting may be the beachhead inside the electoral system it will likely establish for Republican officeholders untethered to America’s democratic traditions as we have known them.\n\nIn more conventional political calculations, Tuesday’s results seem likely to resurface debates, that had somewhat receded during the Trump years, over the structural electoral challenges Democrats face in the battle to control Congress.\n\nThe modern period of Congressional elections arguably began in 1994, when Republicans captured both the House and Senate in the backlash against Bill Clinton’s chaotic first two years. That ended an era in which Democrats had held the House majority for 40 consecutive years, and controlled the Senate, usually by wide margins, for all but six years over that long span.\n\nSince 1994, though, Republicans have controlled Congress more often than Democrats. The GOP has held the Senate for about 16 and a half years (counting the roughly half year before the party switch cost them their majority in 2001) and Democrats for only about 11 and a half years. The imbalance in the House has been even more lopsided: Republicans have held it for 20 of these past 28 years, and Democrats for just eight. Especially ominous for Democrats is that if they lose the House on Tuesday, it would mark the second consecutive time they have surrendered their majority only four years after regaining it. (The previous case came when they were swept from the majority by the Tea Party uprising in 2010, just four years after they recaptured the chamber in 2006.) By contrast, Republicans held the House for 12 consecutive years from 1994 through 2006, and then for eight from 2010 through 2018.\n\nWhat makes this disparity especially striking is that it has come even as Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections since 1992 – something no party has done since the formation of the two-party system in 1828. (No Republican candidate has reached even 51% of the presidential popular vote since 1988.) These results clearly suggest the modern Democratic electoral coalition, on a nationwide basis, is larger than the Republican coalition. And yet, Republicans, more often than not, have controlled the Congressional majorities in this era anyway.\n\nAggressive GOP gerrymanders partly explain that difference in the House. But that doesn’t fully explain the GOP’s House advantage and it isn’t a factor at all in the party’s Senate edge. Instead, the Republican Congressional success largely reflects geographic and demographic limitations of the Democratic coalition that almost certainly will be evident again this week.\n\nTuesday’s election is likely to remind Democrats again that they are competing in too few places to establish a durable majority in Congress. In the House, Republicans have established such an overwhelming hold on rural and exurban districts that Democrats must win a very high share of urban and suburban districts to reach a majority. In a good year, like 2018, Democrats can meet that test. And even now, the continued resistance of college-educated suburban voters to the Trump-era Republican Party has provided Democrats a chance to hold down their losses in white-collar districts. But ceding so many rural, exurban and small-town seats leaves Democrats too little cushion to lose some of their suburban seats – as they inevitably will when discontent over the economy, and secondarily crime, is this high even in those places.\n\nIf anything, the Democrats’ geographic challenge is even greater in the Senate. A dominant trend in modern US politics is that both parties are winning virtually all the Senate seats in states that typically support their presidential candidates. The challenge for Democrats is that, despite their repeated victories in the popular vote, slightly more states reliably lean Republican than Democrat in presidential races. Democrats already hold 39 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that voted against Donald Trump both times (Susan Collins in Maine is the only exception). But 25 states voted for Trump both times, and they provide Republicans an even larger Senate contingent, with the GOP holding 47 of their 50 seats. Democrats have squeezed out their precarious 50-50 Senate majority only by capturing eight of the ten seats in the five states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia).\n\nThis geography is what makes this week’s Senate elections so crucial to Democrats. This year’s key races are occurring almost entirely in states that Biden won, albeit mostly narrowly, with Democrats defending seats in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Colorado and Washington, and targeting Republican-held seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (With longer odds, Democrats have also mounted serious challenges to Republicans in Ohio and North Carolina, two states that twice voted for Trump.) Given that map, Democratic strategists recognize it’s critical for the party to expand, or at least maintain, its Senate margin now.\n\nAfter this year, the Senate terrain will rapidly become more foreboding for Democrats. In 2024, they will be defending all three of the seats they hold in the two-time Trump states (Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana), as well as seats in half a dozen other swing states that could go either way in a presidential contest (including Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.) If most of the toss up Senate races fall to the Republicans on Tuesday, those gains, combined with the 2024 map, could put the GOP in position to dominate the upper chamber throughout this decade. “If Republicans take the Senate, I don’t see in our immediate lifetime how Democrats are going to take back” the majority, says Doug Sosnik, a senior White House political adviser to Bill Clinton.\n\nMuch of the Democrats’ Senate problem is rooted in the constitutional provision that provides two Senate seats to every state. That magnifies the influence of sparsely populated, rural and strongly Republican interior states. There’s no political repositioning that is likely to provide Democrats a realistic chance any time soon to win Senate seats in Wyoming and Idaho or North and South Dakota.\n\nBut many Democratic strategists argue that the party must expand its map in the Senate by finding ways to attract more non-college and non-urban voters, especially with white people, but across racial lines, in at least a few more states. That list of potential targets includes places like Ohio, Iowa and Florida where Democrats competed much more effectively as recently as under President Barack Obama. Rebuilding the party’s competitiveness in those states could take years and likely require a significant change in its positioning and message.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic group Third Way, points out that while the party’s modern coalition of young people, racial minorities and college-educated whites has allowed it to effectively contest the presidency, it doesn’t represent a winning majority in enough states to reliably hold the Senate. “When you look at the electoral college, college educated [and diverse] America is close to enough to elect you president,” Kessler says. “But it is not close to getting you a majority in the Senate.”\n\nTuesday’s election could also demonstrate the reemergence of a second demographic challenge for Democrats in the battle for Congress, what analysts in the past have called the “boom and bust” nature of their electoral coalition. The biggest remaining uncertainty for Tuesday’s election may be how many young people, who polls show continue to back Democrats in large proportions, turn out. Usually, turnout falls more for young people than for older generations between presidential and midterm elections (hence the “boom and bust” risk). But in 2018, robust youth turnout helped power the Democratic gains.\n\nLarge-scale polls focused particularly on young adults (such as the Harvard Institute of Politics survey) have found them expressing levels of interest comparable to 2018. Yet their participation in early voting has been lackluster, and several recent national surveys (such as CNN’s poll last week) found their engagement lagging. If turnout among young adults disappoints on Tuesday, it will strengthen those Democrats who argue the party must prioritize regaining ground among middle-income, middle-aged voters, especially those without college degrees. (That includes non-college Latinos, particularly men, who may continue to drift away from Democrats at least somewhat this week.) The sharpest post-election debates among Democrats are likely to revolve around whether the party must embrace more conservative approaches on crime and immigration, two issues Republicans wielded to powerful effect, in order to earn a second look from more non-college educated voters across racial lines.\n\nHistory says that a bad result on Tuesday need not panic Democrats about 2024 (though, in practice, it probably will). Midterms have not had much value forecasting the result of the presidential election two years later. Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush had relatively good first-term midterms and then lost their reelection races. The president (or his party) did lose the White House two years after bad midterms in 1958, 1966, 1974 and 2018. But Harry Truman in 1948, Ronald Reagan in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 all won reelection, usually convincingly, two years after stinging midterm losses. Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist who has built models that project presidential outcomes based on economic and public opinion data, says the results of the midterm add literally no predictive value to the forecasts.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election will begin almost immediately after Tuesday – probably before all the last votes are counted. Though midterm gains are the rule for the party out of power, Trump is likely to interpret GOP victories as a clarion call for his return; aides say he could announce a 2024 candidacy as soon as this month. White House officials believe Biden is certain to run if Trump does because he views the former president as an existential threat to American democracy. On Election Day 2024, the combined age of these two men will be nearly 160 years. Polls show that one of the few areas of broad public agreement is that most Americans do not want either to run again.\n\nYet, long before any newly elected officials take office, or any gavels in Congress change hands, the first consequence of Tuesday’s bitterly fought election may be to place America more firmly on the path toward exactly such a rematch. And this time, such a confrontation could occur with the electoral machinery in decisive states under control of Trump allies who share his willingness to tilt or even subvert the system. Whatever storms rattle the political system this week, the real tempest won’t arrive until 2024 – and it may bring the greatest strain on the nation’s fundamental cohesion since the Civil War.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe race for the Senate is in the eye of the beholder less than six weeks from Election Day, with ads about abortion, crime and inflation dominating the airwaves in key states as campaigns test the theory of the 2022 election.\n\nThe cycle started out as a referendum on President Joe Biden – an easy target for Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the evenly divided chamber. Then the US Supreme Court’s late June decision overturning Roe v. Wade gave Democrats the opportunity to paint a contrast as Republicans struggled to explain their support for an abortion ruling that the majority of the country opposes. Former President Donald Trump’s omnipresence in the headlines gave Democrats another foil.\n\nBut the optimism some Democrats felt toward the end of the summer, on the heels of Biden’s legislative wins and the galvanizing high court decision, has been tempered slightly by the much anticipated tightening of some key races as political advertising ramps up on TV and voters tune in after Labor Day.\n\nRepublicans, who have midterm history on their side as the party out of the White House, have hammered Biden and Democrats for supporting policies they argue exacerbate inflation. Biden’s approval rating stands at 41% with 54% disapproving in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which tracks the average of recent surveys. And with some prices inching back up after a brief hiatus, the economy and inflation – which Americans across the country identify as their top concern in multiple polls – are likely to play a crucial role in deciding voters’ preferences.\n\nBut there’s been a steady increase in ads about crime too as the GOP returns to a familiar criticism, depicting Democrats as weak on public safety. Cops have been ubiquitous in TV ads this cycle – candidates from both sides of the aisle have found law enforcement officers to testify on camera to their pro-police credentials. Democratic ads also feature women talking about the threat of a national abortion ban should the Senate fall into GOP hands, while Republicans have spent comparatively less trying to portray Democrats as the extremists on the topic.\n\nWhile the issue sets have fluctuated, the Senate map hasn’t changed. Republicans’ top pickup opportunities have always been Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire – all states that Biden carried in 2020. In two of those states, however, the GOP has significant problems, although the states themselves keep the races competitive. Arizona nominee Blake Masters is now without the support of the party’s major super PAC, which thinks its money can be better spent elsewhere, including in New Hampshire, where retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc is far from the nominee the national GOP had wanted. But this is the time of year when poor fundraising can really become evident since TV ad rates favor candidates and a super PAC gets much less bang for its buck.\n\nThe race for Senate control may come down to three states: Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, all of which are rated as “Toss-up” races by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. As Republicans look to flip the Senate, which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called a “50-50 proposition,” they’re trying to pick up the first two and hold on to the latter.\n\nSenate Democrats’ path to holding their majority lies with defending their incumbents. Picking off a GOP-held seat like Pennsylvania – still the most likely to flip in CNN’s ranking – would help mitigate any losses. Wisconsin, where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is vying for a third term, looks like Democrats’ next best pickup opportunity, but that race drops in the rankings this month as Republican attacks take a toll on the Democratic nominee in the polls.\n\nThese rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. It will be updated one more time before Election Day.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe most consistent thing about CNN’s rankings, dating back to 2021, has been Pennsylvania’s spot in first place. But the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has tightened since the primaries in May, when Republican Mehmet Oz emerged badly bruised from a nasty intraparty contest. In a CNN Poll of Polls average of recent surveys in the state, Democrat John Fetterman, the state lieutenant governor, had the support of 50% of likely voters to Oz’s 45%. (The Poll of Polls is an average of the four most recent nonpartisan surveys of likely voters that meet CNN’s standards.) Fetterman is still overperforming Biden, who narrowly carried Pennsylvania in 2020. Fetterman’s favorability ratings are also consistently higher than Oz’s.\n\nOne potential trouble spot for the Democrat: More voters in a late September Franklin and Marshall College Poll viewed Oz has having policies that would improve voters’ economic circumstances, with the economy and inflation remaining the top concern for voters across a range of surveys. But nearly five months after the primary, the celebrity surgeon still seems to have residual issues with his base. A higher percentage of Democrats were backing Fetterman than Republicans were backing Oz in a recent Fox News survey, for example, with much of that attributable to lower support from GOP women than men. Fetterman supporters were also much more enthusiastic about their candidate than Oz supporters.\n\nRepublicans have been hammering Fetterman on crime, specifically his tenure on the state Board of Pardons: An ad from the Senate Leadership Fund features a Bucks County sheriff saying, “Protect your family. Don’t vote Fetterman.” But the lieutenant governor is also using sheriffs on camera to defend his record. And with suburban voters being a crucial demographic, Democratic advertising is also leaning into abortion, like this Senate Majority PAC ad that features a female doctor as narrator and plays Oz’s comments from during the primary about abortion being “murder.” Oz’s campaign has said that he supports exceptions for “the life of the mother, rape and incest” and that “he’d want to make sure that the federal government is not involved in interfering with the state’s decisions on the topic.”\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nRepublicans have four main pickup opportunities – and right now, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s seat looks like one of their best shots. Biden carried Nevada by a slightly larger margin than two of those other GOP-targeted states, but the Silver State’s large transient population adds a degree of uncertainty to this contest.\n\nRepublicans have tried to tie the first-term senator to Washington spending and inflation, which may be particularly resonant in a place where average gas prices are now back up to over $5 a gallon. Democrats are zeroing in on abortion rights and raising the threat that a GOP-controlled Senate could pass a national abortion ban. Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt – the rare GOP nominee to have united McConnell and Trump early on – called the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling a “joke” before the Supreme Court overturned the decision in June. Democrats have been all too happy to use that comment against him, but Laxalt has tried to get around those attacks by saying he does not support a national ban and pointing out that the right to an abortion is settled law in Nevada.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThe closer we get to Election Day, the more we need to talk about the Georgia Senate race going over the wire. If neither candidate receives a majority of the vote in November, the contest will go to a December runoff. There was no clear leader in a recent Marist poll that had Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term, and Republican challenger Herschel Walker both under 50% among those who say they definitely plan to vote.\n\nWarnock’s edge from earlier this cycle has narrowed, which bumps this seat up one spot on the rankings. The good news for Warnock is that he’s still overperforming Biden’s approval numbers in a state that the President flipped in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes. And so far, he seems to be keeping the Senate race closer than the gubernatorial contest, for which several polls have shown GOP Gov. Brian Kemp ahead. Warnock’s trying to project a bipartisan image that he thinks will help him hold on in what had until recently been a reliably red state. Standing waist-deep in peanuts in one recent ad, he touts his work with Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville to “eliminate the regulations,” never mentioning his own party. But Republicans have continued to try to tie the senator to his party – specifically for voting for measures in Washington that they claim have exacerbated inflation.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that enough Georgians won’t see voting for Walker as an option – even if they do back Kemp. Democrats have amped up their attacks on domestic violence allegations against the former football star and unflattering headlines about his business record. And all eyes will be on the mid-October debate to see how Walker, who has a history of making controversial and illogical comments, handles himself onstage against the more polished incumbent.\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020 – in fact, he broke his own term limits pledge to run a third time, saying he believed America was “in peril.” And although Johnson has had low approval numbers for much of the cycle, Democrats have underestimated him before. This contest moves down one spot on the ranking as Johnson’s race against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has tightened, putting the senator in a better position.\n\nBarnes skated through the August primary after his biggest opponents dropped out of the race, but as the nominee, he’s faced an onslaught of attacks, especially on crime, using against him his past words about ending cash bail and redirecting some funding from police budgets to social services. Barnes has attempted to answer those attacks in his ads, like this one featuring a retired police sergeant who says he knows “Mandela doesn’t want to defund the police.”\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll from early September showed no clear leader, with Johnson at 49% and Barnes at 48% among likely voters, which is a tightening from the 7-point edge Barnes enjoyed in the same poll’s August survey. Notably, independents were breaking slightly for Johnson after significantly favoring Barnes in the August survey. The effect of the GOP’s anti-Barnes advertising can likely be seen in the increasing percentage of registered voters in a late September Fox News survey who view the Democrat as “too extreme,” putting him on parity with Johnson on that question. Johnson supporters are also much more enthusiastic about their candidate.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who’s running for a full six-year term after winning a 2020 special election, is still one of the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in a state that has only recently grown competitive on the federal level. But Republican nominee Blake Masters is nowhere close to rivaling Kelly in fundraising, and major GOP outside firepower is now gone. After canceling its September TV reservations in Arizona to redirect money to Ohio, the Senate Leadership Fund has cut its October spending too.\n\nOther conservative groups are spending for Masters but still have work to do to hurt Kelly, a well-funded incumbent with a strong personal brand. Kelly led Masters 51% to 41% among registered voters in a September Marist poll, although that gap narrowed among those who said they definitely plan to vote. A Fox survey from a little later in the month similarly showed Kelly with a 5-point edge among those certain to vote, just within the margin of error.\n\nMasters has attempted to moderate his abortion position since winning his August primary, buoyed by a Trump endorsement, but Kelly has continued to attack him on the issue. And a recent court decision allowing the enforcement of a 1901 state ban on nearly all abortions has given Democrats extra fodder to paint Republicans as a threat to women’s reproductive rights.\n\n6. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina slides up one spot on the rankings, trading places with New Hampshire. The open-seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr hasn’t generated as much national buzz as other states given that Democrats haven’t won a Senate seat in the state since 2008.\n\nBut it has remained a tight contest with Democrat Cheri Beasley, who is bidding to become the state’s first Black senator, facing off against GOP Rep. Ted Budd, for whom Trump recently campaigned. Beasley lost reelection as state Supreme Court chief justice by only about 400 votes in 2020 when Trump narrowly carried the Tar Heel state. But Democrats hope that she’ll be able to boost turnout among rural Black voters who might not otherwise vote during a midterm election and that more moderate Republicans and independents will see Budd as too extreme. One of Beasley’s recent spots features a series of mostly White, gray-haired retired judges in suits endorsing her as “someone different” while attacking Budd as being a typical politician out for himself.\n\nBudd is leaning into current inflation woes, specifically going after Biden in some ads that feature half-empty shopping carts, without even mentioning Beasley. Senate Leadership Fund is doing the work of trying to tie the Democrat to Washington – one recent spot almost makes her look like the incumbent in the race, superimposing her photo over an image of the US Capitol and displaying her face next to Biden’s. Both SLF and Budd are also targeting Beasley over her support for Democrats’ recently enacted health care, tax and climate bill. “Liberal politician Cheri Beasley is coming for you – and your wallet,” the narrator from one SLF ad intones, before later adding, “Beasley’s gonna knock on your door with an army of new IRS agents.” (The new law increases funding for the IRS, including for audits. But Democrats and the Trump-appointed IRS commissioner have said the intention is to go after wealthy tax cheats, not the middle class.)\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nA lot has been made of GOP candidate quality this cycle. But there are few states where the difference between the nominee Republicans have and the one they’d hoped to have has altered these rankings quite as much as New Hampshire.\n\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who lost a 2020 GOP bid for the state’s other Senate seat, won last month’s Republican primary to take on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. The problem for him, though, is that he doesn’t have much money to wage that fight. Bolduc had raised a total of $579,000 through August 24 compared with Hassan’s $31.4 million. Senate Leadership Fund is on air in New Hampshire to boost the GOP nominee – attacking Hassan for voting with Biden and her support of her party’s health care, tax and climate package. But because super PACs get much less favorable TV advertising rates than candidates, those millions won’t go anywhere near as far as Hassan’s dollars will.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were still optimistic that Gov. Chris Sununu would run for Senate, giving them a popular abortion rights-supporting nominee in a state that’s trended blue in recent federal elections. Bolduc told WMUR after his primary win that he’d vote against a national abortion ban. But ads from Hassan and Senate Majority PAC have seized on his suggestion in the same interview that the senator should “get over” the abortion issue. Republicans recognize that abortion is a salient factor in a state Biden carried by 7 points, but they also argue that the election – as Bolduc said to WMUR – will be about the economy and that Hassan is an unpopular and out-of-touch incumbent.\n\nHassan led Bolduc 49% to 41% among likely voters in a Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The incumbent has consolidated Democratic support, but only 83% of Republicans said they were with Bolduc, the survey found. Still, some of those Republicans, like those who said they were undecided, could come home to the GOP nominee as the general election gets closer, which means Bolduc has room to grow. He’ll need more than just Republicans to break his way, however, which is one reason he quickly pivoted on the key issue of whether the 2020 election was stolen days after he won the primary.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nOhio – a state that twice voted for Trump by 8 points – isn’t supposed to be on this list at No. 8, above Florida, which backed the former President by much narrower margins. But it’s at No. 8 for the second month in a row. Republican nominee J.D. Vance’s poor fundraising has forced Senate Leadership Fund to redirect millions from other races to Ohio to shore him up and attack Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee who had the airwaves to himself all summer. The 10-term congressman has been working to distance himself from his party in most of his ads, frequently mentioning that he “voted with Trump on trade” and criticizing the “defund the police” movement. Vance is finally on the air, trying to poke some holes in Ryan’s image.\n\nBut polling still shows a tight race with no clear leader. Ryan had an edge with independents in a recent Siena College/Spectrum News poll, which also showed that Vance – Trump’s pick for the nomination – has more work to do to consolidate GOP support after an ugly May primary. Assuming he makes up that support and late undecided voters break his way, Vance will likely hold the advantage in the end given the Buckeye State’s solidifying red lean.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats face an uphill battle against GOP Sen. Marco Rubio in an increasingly red-trending state, which Trump carried by about 3 points in 2020 – nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, who easily won the party’s nomination in August, is a strong candidate who has even outraised the GOP incumbent, but not by enough to seriously jeopardize his advantage. She’s leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief – it features prominently in her advertising, in which she repeatedly rejects the idea of defunding the police. Still, Rubio has tried to tie her to the “radical left” in Washington to undercut her own law enforcement background.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Bennet is no stranger to tough races. In 2016, he only won reelection by 6 points against an underfunded GOP challenger whom the national party had abandoned. Given GOP fundraising challenges in some of their top races, the party hasn’t had the resources to seriously invest in the Centennial State this year.\n\nBut in his bid for a third full term, Bennet is up against a stronger challenger in businessman Joe O’Dea, who told CNN he disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. His wife and daughter star in his ads as he tries to cut a more moderate profile and vows not to vote the party line in Washington.\n\nBennet, however, is attacking O’Dea for voting for a failed 2020 state ballot measure to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy and arguing that whatever O’Dea says about supporting abortion rights, he’d give McConnell “the majority he needs” to pass a national abortion ban.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/politics/senate-race-rankings-july-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith more than half of this year’s competitive Senate matchups set, the overall electoral environment remains consistent: President Joe Biden’s poor approval numbers, combined with a pervasive sense that the country is headed in the wrong direction, are weighing down Democrats looking to maintain control of Congress.\n\nBut bruising Republican primaries and the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last month offer a few – albeit potentially ephemeral – glimmers of optimism for Democrats.\n\nAny big Supreme Court-related development can raise the stakes of Senate races because of the chamber’s role in confirming future justices. But last month’s ruling that found there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion could drive even more attention to the Senate since it’s Congress that would set any future nationwide abortion policies.\n\nPressed on how to respond to the ruling in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last month, Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly said, “There’s an election happening.”\n\nFor Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters, especially those feeling uninspired by Biden’s first term so far, the ruling could motivate them to vote this fall. It remains to be seen, however, how much of that energy is sustainable and to what degree the ruling also persuades independents or moderate Republicans to vote Democratic. In the immediate term, the elimination of federal abortion rights has resulted in Democratic outside groups such as Planned Parenthood Votes and Women Vote!, the super PAC arm of EMILY’s List, going up on the air attacking Republicans.\n\nAnother bright spot for Democrats, underscored by the abortion issue, is that the Senate playing field includes states such as Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado that have recently voted blue. In fact, seven of the 10 races on this list of seats most likely to flip are in states Biden won in 2020.\n\nThe addition of Colorado at No. 10 on this latest ranking, however, speaks to the challenging national environment for Democrats. Economic issues – high inflation and gas prices this summer travel season – are still weighing on voters and are often cited as their most pressing concern. Republicans have also tried tapping into Americans’ post-pandemic anxieties about safety, with ads suggesting Democrats are soft on crime. Some Democratic candidates have worked to get ahead of those attacks early by featuring uniformed police in their own spots and directly refuting the idea of “defunding the police.”\n\nBesides Colorado’s appearance on the list, the biggest change to this month’s ranking is Nevada and Georgia trading places. It may seem somewhat counterintuitive, especially in this era of hyper-nationalized elections and considering Nevada is a more Democratic state than Georgia. But the change was driven by the candidate matchups in the two states, as things stand now. The ranking is based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\nJust a handful of important Senate primaries that will shape the November midterms remain. They key ones to watch in August and September: The Republican primaries in Arizona, Missouri and New Hampshire and the Democratic primary in Wisconsin.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe start of the general election in the Keystone State was a mixed bag for Democrats trying to flip the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Their nominee, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, was sidelined by a stroke just before he won the primary and has been off the trail recuperating. But then they got the Republican opponent they wanted in celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz.\n\nThe Donald Trump-backed candidate narrowly won the GOP nomination after a recount, but not without his image taking a serious hit – weeks of attack ads from Republican rival Dave McCormick and his allies had driven up Oz’s negatives. (In a Fox survey ahead of the primary, for example, 46% of GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Oz.) The race is expected to tighten as some of those Republican voters get behind Oz now that he’s the party nominee.\n\nBut Democrats’ message is picking up where the primary left off. Fetterman’s TV spots, which lean into an “us vs. Washington” theme that never mentions the candidate’s party ID, repeat that he’s “from Pennsylvania, for Pennsylvania” – an implicit knock on Oz, who has said he moved from New Jersey in late 2020. Republicans are equally happy to be running against Fetterman, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who handily defeated his more moderate primary challenger. But in a state that Biden carried and with the GOP primary forcing Oz to the right, this seat is still the most likely to flip in the fall.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nNevada moves up one spot, trading places with Georgia, where the fundamentals of the state (for example, past presidential performance) would seem to give Republicans a better chance of unseating a Democratic incumbent. But the Republican Senate nominee in the Silver State, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, is a more tested candidate than the GOP nominee in Georgia, ex-NFL star Herschel Walker.\n\nThat may not be saying much considering Walker, a political neophyte, is widely seen as the biggest wild-card candidate of the cycle and Laxalt lost his last bid for statewide office (the 2018 gubernatorial race). Laxalt, however, has held statewide office before and is the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was on the ballot just last year, also started the cycle as a better defined (and funded) Democratic incumbent than Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who hasn’t faced voters in this transient state in six years. Masto has a tough road ahead, to be sure – and fissures in the state Democratic Party aren’t helping – but the Supreme Court ruling on abortion could work in Democrats’ favor in a state where even the most recent GOP governor supported abortion rights.\n\nLaxalt sought to downplay the political impact of the court’s decision last month, saying in a statement that abortion rights were “settled law” in the state. But that likely won’t stop Democrats from pointing to his praise for the decision and arguing that he’d be another Republican vote in the Senate should Congress attempt to pass an abortion ban.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nEven Democrats are somewhat skeptical about a recent Quinnipiac University poll that showed Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term after winning a special election last year, ahead of GOP challenger Walker by 10 points among registered voters. But even if that margin was too big to be true – there aren’t yet many other public surveys for comparison – it was notably wider than Georgia’s gubernatorial matchup, suggesting there’s something specific to this race, rather than the poll itself, going on here.\n\nThe margin was also a departure from Warnock’s and Walker’s neck-and-neck standing in Quinnipiac’s January poll, which could reflect recent troublesome headlines for Walker, who received negative ratings for honesty in the June survey. His campaign recently acknowledged, for example, that he has three children by women he was not married to, in addition to his son by his former wife. That’s opened him up to charges of hypocrisy given his public criticism of absentee fathers, especially in Black families. (Walker just went up with his first ad of the general election, and the positive spot – a hybrid ad paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee – doesn’t offer more than bland platitudes about him wanting to serve Georgia.)\n\nWhat’s most encouraging for Democrats facing a tough national environment may be that Warnock is still viewed more positively than Biden. The senator’s job approval rating was at 49% in the Quinnipiac poll, compared with 33% for the President. That’s some impressive separation the first-term senator has been able to create from the White House in a state not predisposed to vote Democratic. The poll was mostly conducted after the Supreme Court’s abortion decision on June 24, so Warnock’s advantage over Walker may also reflect some of the immediate backlash to that ruling, which won’t necessarily be sustained through the fall.\n\nThe good news for Republicans? A plurality of Georgians said inflation was the most urgent issue facing the state, which means the GOP still has four months to double down on messages like this one, from One Nation, accusing Warnock of voting for “reckless spending” that, the ad contends, has led to higher costs for Georgians.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nArizona is hosting one of the few outstanding GOP primaries that will help shape how competitive things are in the fall. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s used his fundraising advantage to go on the air while his would-be GOP opponents duke it out amongst themselves.\n\nTrump-backed Blake Masters has the support of billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the Club for Growth. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon is largely self-funding his campaign, which has spent nearly $8 million on TV, including future reservations, according to AdImpact data from the beginning of July. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich – a frequent Trump target for having helped certify Biden’s win in the state – was once thought to have been the front-runner because he holds statewide elected office, but there’s little sign he’s put together a competitive campaign.\n\nThe Trump backing should position Masters well in a GOP primary, but he’s embraced the former President’s election lies and downplayed the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – a potential vulnerability in a purple state in the fall. More worrisome for some Republicans may be Masters’ suggestion, as reported by CNN’s Kyung Lah, that the US could privatize Social Security, which isn’t likely to go over well in retiree-heavy Arizona. While he doesn’t yet have an opponent, Kelly hasn’t escaped scrutiny. GOP-aligned groups are trying to tie the freshman senator, who now has a voting record, to Biden and the party in power in Washington.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the most vulnerable Republican incumbent of 2022. And with his favorability numbers mired in the 30s, it’s no surprise his campaign has been rolling out a series of positive ads featuring constituents testifying directly to the camera about what a good senator he’s been. In a June Marquette Law School poll, 37% of Wisconsin voters viewed Johnson favorably. The two-term senator, who broke a term limit pledge to run again, has been known to generate controversy. Revelations that his office was involved in an effort to send then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors prompted several of his Democratic challengers to call on him to resign. (Johnson has dismissed the story, saying they were staff-level discussions.)\n\nBut Democrats have discounted him before. His 41% favorability rating in October 2016 – just before he won a second term – isn’t much better than his numbers now. And even if their incumbent isn’t in as strong a position as they’d like, the good news for Republicans is that Biden’s job approval in the Badger State is at 40% – the lowest mark in Marquette’s polling since he took office. GOP enthusiasm to vote also outpaced Democratic enthusiasm – 67% to 58% – in the Marquette survey.\n\nThe task for Democrats, who pick their nominee on August 9, is to show that Johnson has changed and is no longer the senator Wisconsinites elected twice. The primary is the last truly unsettled Democratic contest in a competitive general election state. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes continues to lead the primary field with 25% in the Marquette poll, but his lead over Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry (21%) is within the margin of error. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski was at 9%, while Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson was at 7%. Marquette tested hypothetical general election matchups for the first time this cycle, finding a margin-of-error contest regardless of the pairing.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nA recent 30-second, direct-to-camera spot from Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan says a lot about the contours of this race. “The Supreme Court has taken away a woman’s most fundamental freedom,” the first-year senator says, before raising the specter of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and a GOP-controlled Senate trying to ban abortion nationwide.\n\nHassan is running for reelection in a state that increasingly votes blue in federal elections and has a GOP governor who supports abortion rights. Still, a bad national environment for Democrats, combined with the Granite State’s swingy nature, has Hassan on notice. Even if most of her would-be GOP challengers aren’t very well known ahead of the September 13 primary, it may not take much more than a generic Republican to unseat her if that’s the way the winds are blowing in November.\n\nThat explains why Hassan, whose campaign announced it had raised more than $5 million in the second quarter, is using the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling to try to shift the conversation toward a hypothetical Republican-controlled Washington that New Hampshire voters may not like. The great unknown, however, is whether frustrations with the economy and dissatisfaction with the direction of the country will outweigh other concerns in November.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRepublican Rep. Ted Budd enters the general election with a built-in advantage in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr given that Trump twice carried the state. And while the conservative congressman’s fundraising hasn’t impressed, outside GOP groups are carrying the weight on TV, attacking Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley’s judicial record. Local TV stations took down one of those ads, but the soft-on-crime attack line is a central message Republicans are deploying against the first Black woman elected as chief justice to the state Supreme Court.\n\nBeasley has responded by touting her law enforcement support, including with a spot that features sheriffs and police captains. “Cheri’s always had our backs, and we know she always will,” Richmond County Sheriff Mark Gulledge says. Another recent Beasley ad tries to distance the candidate from Democratic control of Washington, as she says, “Neither political party is getting it right” while promising to hold Washington accountable.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are trying to portray Budd, who was boosted by the campaign arm of the Club for Growth in the primary, as too extreme for the state. Senate Majority PAC, a major Democratic super PAC, invested in this race after initially leaving it off its early reservations – a sign that Democrats haven’t counted this one out even if it’s less of a priority than other GOP-held seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio still has the advantage in this race, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who’s heavily favored to win the Senate nomination on August 23, is keeping the race interesting by raising impressive money.\n\nWhile Rubio has the backing of some major law enforcement groups in the state, Demings is leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief to try to refute his attempts to tie her to the national party. “In the Senate, I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police. That’s just crazy,” she says in her first ad.\n\nBut in a state that has grown incrementally Republican in recent elections, Demings would face a difficult general election against Rubio, who has built a national profile over his two terms in the Senate and should benefit from political tailwinds this fall.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, the Democrat running an uphill campaign to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman, is also trying to show his support for law enforcement. “Tim Ryan knows defunding the police is ridiculous,” the Stark County sheriff says in a recent ad for the Democratic nominee.\n\nRyan, a 10-term congressman who easily won his May primary, is up against “Hillbilly Elegy” author JD Vance, who emerged from one of the ugliest GOP contests of the cycle helped by Trump’s backing. The former President has twice won Ohio, which hasn’t been very hospitable of late to Democrats running for federal statewide office – US Sen. Sherrod Brown being the notable exception.\n\nThat’s why Ryan, who once challenged Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader, is being vocal about distancing himself from his party. “When (President Barack) Obama’s trade deal threatened jobs here, I voted against it,” he says in another ad as he walks through Youngstown sporting a gray hoodie. “And I voted with Trump on trade,” he adds, trying to project an image of Buckeye State authenticity. It’s not clear that’ll be enough against a Trump-backed candidate in a nationalized election, but it may be Ryan’s best shot. And with his campaign announcing that he raised $9 million in the second quarter that ended June 30, it looks like he’ll at least have the resources to carry that message.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nGraeme Sloan/SIPA USA/AP\n\nColorado steals the 10th spot on this list from Missouri. What’s going on in the Centennial State? Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is running for a third full term against businessman Joe O’Dea, whose emergence from last month’s GOP primary makes this race competitive. (Democrats had spent millions trying to help his primary opponent win because they thought he’d be a weaker general election candidate.)\n\nAs a Republican who supports abortion rights in the early stages of pregnancy, O’Dea brings a unique profile to the race. Colorado has trended blue in recent federal elections – Biden won it by more than 13 points in 2020, the same year GOP Sen. Cory Gardner was unseated by 9 points. But Bennet’s previous elections have been close. In 2016, for example, he prevailed by only about 6 points against an underwhelming opponent whom the national GOP had abandoned. Against a more formidable Republican challenger in a tough year for Democrats, Bennet could be vulnerable.\n\nIn Missouri, meanwhile, the Republican field is still unsettled ahead of the August 2 primary. Looming over the party is the possibility of disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the nomination, which is the only way this seat would be competitive for Democrats.\n\nThe entrance of independent candidate John Wood could potentially complicate the race. Wood, a former senior investigator for the House January 6 committee, describes himself as a “lifelong Republican” and has said he would back McConnell for Senate leader, if elected. But if Greitens is the GOP nominee, Wood’s candidacy could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote in the general election, making it more likely the controversial Republican keeps this seat in party hands. We’ll revisit Missouri’s spot on the list after the crucial GOP primary.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Adam Laxalt’s relationship to the former Nevada governor and senator with the same last name.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/senate-race-rankings-may-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year’s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall – Ohio, where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him – in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nTrump’s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him – the candidate’s past criticism of Trump.\n\nThe former President’s backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, but she’s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\n\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn’t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania, but it didn’t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\n\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden’s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they’re facing.\n\nCNN’s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans’ favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nPennsylvania – a state Biden won in 2020 – has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn’t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has Trump’s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie – with a margin close enough to trigger the state’s automatic recount process.\n\nCounties need to finish recounting – which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation – by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\n\nOz has declared himself the “presumptive” nominee, following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President’s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. “I like Trump … but not his Senate pick,” voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\n\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn’t enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\n\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump’s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount – and what that means for the general election. Oz’s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\n\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to “take on Washington,” coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke, leaving him in the hospital on election night.\n\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who’s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating “Trump Republicans” in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\n\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats’ road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it’s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\n\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump’s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State’s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won’t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump’s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state’s Senate seats.\n\n3. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May’s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President’s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that’s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters. It doesn’t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\n\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year – $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn’t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general – he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role – and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump’s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it’s time for a change in Washington.\n\nLaxalt first faces a primary on June 14. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is on the air attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who’s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump’s backing in his own recent spot.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House – such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\n\nLuckily for Kelly, the messy Republican primary field won’t be sorted until August. So while he’s facing attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he doesn’t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It’s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who’s been a target of the former President’s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by Peter Thiel, who was also behind Trump’s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given his differences with the group over the Ohio Senate primary.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Ron Johnson finally stepped up his fundraising – he brought in about $6 million in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He’s been running positive spots, featuring families who say their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson’s support for so-called Right to Try legislation.\n\nThat’s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular – 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase “cares about people like me” did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\n\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\n\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn’t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field – upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu’s decision not to seek the nomination – develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state’s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire’s late primary in September.\n\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu’s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration’s plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nOne of Trump’s earliest Senate primary endorsements – for US Rep. Ted Budd last June – resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\n\nThe Trump endorsement didn’t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. “Pat’s a nice guy, but he’s no conservative,” Robinson says, admitting that he’d voted for McCrory in the past “but not this time.” McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is “weak” on a host of issues.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. “Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,” she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won’t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio’s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\n\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won’t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio’s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden’s decision to rescind Title 42. Demings’ team recently said she does not support lifting the measure “until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.”\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe first major test of Trump’s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance, who received Trump’s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\n\nVance’s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it’s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\n\nStill, missing out on Trump’s endorsement didn’t stop the jockeying among some other candidates (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in an open spat with Trump, ran more clips of Vance’s past criticism of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said “they love Trump,” questioning the former President’s judgment on endorsements past and present.\n\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party’s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nSaul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt’s still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri – does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump’s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri – a red state that shouldn’t otherwise be competitive – remains on this list.\n\nConcerns about Greitens deepened in March after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was physically abusive toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having resigned as governor amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents have called on him to drop out. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory.\n\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn’t said how much she’ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win – while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/16/politics/senate-democrats-fundraising-republicans-advertising-midterms/index.html", "title": "Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSeven Democrats in the 10 most competitive Senate races started this month and the home stretch to Election Day with bigger cash stockpiles than their Republican rivals, newly filed campaign finance reports show.\n\nBut even with that financial edge, Democrats face a withering advertising assault in the final weeks of the campaign from deep-pocketed outside groups.\n\nThe stakes are enormous for both political parties: Control of the Senate – along with the ability to shape federal policy for the remainder of President Joe Biden’s first term – hinges on the results in just a handful of states.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, led GOP outside groups in fundraising, taking in $111 million during the three-month period ending September 30, the new filings show. That figure rivaled its haul during the first 18 months of this election cycle as some of the GOP’s biggest donors stepped up their giving.\n\n“SLF is steadily closing the gap in the fight to retake the Senate majority, and our donors are fired up about slamming the brakes on Joe Biden’s disastrous left-wing agenda,” group president Steve Law said in a statement.\n\nIn all, the fund has spent more than $200 million on advertising this cycle, including ads that have already aired and reservations booked for the final weeks of the election, according to a CNN review of data compiled by AdImpact.\n\nThe McConnell-aligned group “has really been a life raft for Republican Senate candidates across the board that have struggled to fundraise in any great amount,” said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with the nonpartisan political handicapper Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. “What we see in state after state after state is the advertising burden being borne by SLF and outside groups.”\n\nHere are more takeaways from the third-quarter fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission:\n\nThe $20 million club\n\nThe reports, which were due Saturday night, show individual Democratic Senate contenders outraising their Republican rivals in a slew of competitive races – including marquee contests in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nDemocrats in all four of those states – Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Mark Kelly of Arizona; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; and Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin – each collected more than $20 million during the quarter. That was a milestone no Republican Senate hopeful in a competitive race was able to match.\n\nWarnock, Kelly and Fetterman all ended September with more cash on hand than their GOP opponents. Four other states on CNN’s most recent list of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip also saw the Democratic nominees finish with a bigger bank balance on September 30: Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and North Carolina hopeful Cheri Beasley.\n\nWarnock on top\n\nWarnock, in pursuit of a full six-year term after winning a special election last year, brought in $26.4 million during the June-to-September fundraising period, to lead all Senate candidate fundraising. His haul is more than double the nearly $11.7 million raised by his Republican rival, Herschel Walker.\n\nThose figures, however, don’t reflect fundraising since a recent spate of developments in the Georgia contest – including a contentious debate Friday night in Savannah.\n\nNational Republicans have rallied to Walker’s side in recent weeks, following news reports that the Republican paid for a woman’s abortion in 2009 and then asked her to terminate a second pregnancy two years later.\n\nWalker, who said in May that he supported a full ban on abortions, with no exceptions, has called the allegations “a lie.” CNN has not independently confirmed the woman’s allegations.\n\nIn a statement, Walker’s aides said the campaign bought in more than $450,000 online in a single day recently – as prominent Republicans, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who helms the Senate GOP campaign arm – joined him on the stump in an effort to quell the controversy.\n\nHerschel Walker, the GOP Senate nominee in Georgia, has denied the allegations against him. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n\nAlthough Warnock has used his sizable war chest to hammer Walker on the airwaves, a CNN review of advertising buys from October 1 through Election Day tracked by AdImpact shows outside groups, led by the Senate Leadership Fund, dominating the advertising in the Peach State.\n\nSLF’s advertising tops the list at $25.2 million with Georgia Honor, a Democratic super PAC, in second place at just shy of $21.7 million.\n\nBillionaire backers\n\nTop donors to the Senate Leadership Fund during the third quarter included some of the biggest financial backers in Republican politics. Leading the list at $10 million apiece were three billionaires: Miriam Adelson, a physician and widow of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson; Ken Griffin, founder of the Citadel hedge fund; and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The Senate Leadership Fund’s haul also included $20 million from its nonprofit arm, One Nation, which does not disclose its donors’ identities.\n\nSLF entered October sitting atop $85.2 million in cash reserves.\n\n(The Senate Majority PAC, the leading super PAC working to elect Democrats to the chamber, is slated to file a report detailing its most recent fundraising later this week. The group reported more than $65.7 million remaining in the bank at the end of August.)\n\nArizona suspense\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly is seeking a full six-year term. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images\n\nKelly, the Democratic incumbent in Arizona, raised $23 million in the June-to-September window, more than four times the contributions collected by his Republican challenger, Blake Masters, the new filings show.\n\nAnd Kelly, who is seeking a full six-year term, started October with more than $13 million remaining in the bank – far surpassing the $2.8 million available to Masters.\n\nNational Republican leaders have exhorted billionaire investor Peter Thiel to put more money into the Arizona race to rescue Masters, his former employee. (An initial $15 million Thiel sent to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, helped the first-time candidate survive a competitive primary earlier this year.)\n\nSaturday’s filings show Saving Arizona raised a little more than $4.4 million during the third quarter with no additional investment during that period from Thiel.\n\nAmong the biggest donors in the three-month period: Shipping and packaging magnate Richard Uihlein, who gave $3 million. And Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire twin investors perhaps best known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over who invented Facebook, donated $500,000 apiece to the super PAC last month.\n\nA Republican surprise in Washington state\n\nRepublican Tiffany Smiley is challenging Democratic Sen. Patty Murray in Washington state. Ted S. Warren/AP\n\nA notable exception to Democrats’ fundraising dominance: Washington state, where first-time candidate Republican Tiffany Smiley raised $6 million to surpass the $3.6 million brought in by five-term Sen. Patty Murray during the three-month period.\n\nNational Republican groups have not invested so far in trying to topple Murray, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, in this traditionally blue state. (Inside Elections rates the contest as Likely Democratic.)\n\nBut Smiley’s late-breaking fundraising success has put a spotlight on the 39-year-old former triage nurse, who is waging her first political campaign.\n\nMurray entered October with the larger stockpile of available cash – roughly $3.8 million to Smiley’s nearly $2.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ohio – a former bellwether state that has swung to Republicans in recent cycles – Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan raised a substantial $17.2 million, with Republican J.D. Vance lagging far behind in their closer-than-expected contest.\n\nRyan, who has plowed millions of his campaign dollars into advertising, started October with just $1.4 million remaining in the bank to Vance’s nearly $3.4 million. Ryan, a 10-term congressman, has implored national Democratic organizations to help, but they have prioritized other top-tier contests in states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nSLF and, more recently, a super PAC aligned with former President Donald Trump, have hit the airwaves on Vance’s behalf in an effort to keep this open Senate seat in the Republican column.\n\nThe current officeholder, GOP Sen. Rob Portman, is retiring.\n\nVulnerable House Democrats post big sums\n\nIn the 19 House races that Inside Elections currently rates as Toss-ups, the Democratic nominees outraised their GOP opponents during the third quarter, the weekend filings show. And a dozen entered October with more cash in the bank than their Republican rivals.\n\nIn one of the mostly closely watched contests, Alaska’s newly minted congresswoman, Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, collected nearly $4 million during the quarter – including $2.3 million raised after she won an August special election to fill the remainder of the late GOP Rep. Don Young’s term.\n\nPeltola is on the ballot again in November as she seeks a full, two-year term for the state’s lone House seat, and she started October with more than $2.2 million in available cash. That far exceeds the cash balances of her Republican rivals, Nick Begich and former Gov. Sarah Palin.\n\nBegich reported more than $547,000 in available cash and Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, had nearly $195,000.\n\nThe three, along with a Libertarian candidate, will face off next month in a general election that will be decided by the state’s new ranked-choice voting system.\n\nAs in Senate contests, Republican outside groups have been major players in the battle to flip the House.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, the main super PAC focused on GOP efforts to recapture the House majority, recently announced that the group and its nonprofit arm had raised a combined $73 million in the third quarter, bringing its cycle total to $220 million.\n\nIt has spent nearly $160 million on advertising, including future reservations for the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nTrump is not on the ballot this year, but he’s been among the GOP’s most active online fundraisers – blasting out emails and text messages seeking money from his legions of small-dollar donors.\n\nHis joint fundraising committee collected $24.1 million during the third quarter, a roughly 41% jump over the previous three-month period, according to its new report with campaign finance regulators. The former President had pressed supporters with requests for donations following the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in August.\n\nBut Trump’s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee spent nearly as much as it raised, pouring more than $21.7 million into total operating expenses during the quarter.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional third-quarter fundraising information.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten David Wright", "Fredreka Schouten", "David Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/key-dates-2022-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "Key dates for the 2022 midterm election | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nVoting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days.\n\nTexas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.\n\nThe outcome of November’s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden’s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they’re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.\n\nIn the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.\n\nThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors – with 36 seats up for grabs this November – including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.\n\nHere are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:\n\nMarch 1: Texas primaries\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Lynda M. Gonzalez/Pool//Getty Images\n\nThe Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.\n\nThere is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton’s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the “ongoing investigation.”\n\nThe Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He’s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor’s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn’t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary.\n\nApril 5: Special election primary in California’s 22nd Congressional District\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes JIm Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump’s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.\n\nMay 3: Indiana and Ohio primaries\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine Paul Vernon/AP\n\nThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio “like a blue-state liberal.” On the Democratic side, it’s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton’s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati’s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.\n\nIn the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders – most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance – have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn’t fully embrace the former President.\n\nAfter a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018.\n\nMay 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primaries\n\nWest Virginia Rep. David McKinley Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nWest Virginia is poised to hold the country’s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump’s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package.\n\nIn Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nMay 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primaries\n\nCelebrity doctor Mehmet Oz Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party’s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.\n\nDemocrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party’s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.\n\nThere is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth’s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump’s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump’s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nIdaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a “a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.”\n\nMay 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a “Trump ticket” of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump’s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump’s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nWhile the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump’s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump’s demands that he “find” the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state’s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President’s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.\n\nThe Atlanta area will host the year’s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath’s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans – McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020.\n\nGeorgia won’t be the only state testing the power of Trump’s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President’s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.\n\nIn Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee – has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father’s footsteps and become Arkansas’ first female governor.\n\nJune 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California’s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office – which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term.\n\nCalifornia is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state’s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State’s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state’s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.\n\nGOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn’t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council.\n\nAnother race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.\n\nPrior to serving as Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he’s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state.\n\nJune 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primaries\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.\n\nIn the Silver State’s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nThe fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump’s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.\n\nIn Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks – with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago.\n\nJune 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast November’s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP’s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave – Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman’s home near Richmond. Luria’s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.\n\nJune 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)\n\nIllinois Rep. Mary Miller Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.\n\nThe GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump’s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party’s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.\n\nOn the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWith popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor’s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan’s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\n\nJuly 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)\n\nThe calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.\n\nAugust 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primaries\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nTwo states at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day – Arizona and Michigan.\n\nSparked by the former President’s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden’s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump’s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results.\n\nCurrent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state’s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.\n\nFinchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President’s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who’ve spread election falsehoods – Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.\n\nThe new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district’s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President.\n\nTrump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he’s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.\n\nTwo House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump’s impeachment – Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nIn Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.\n\nAugust 4: Tennessee primaries\n\nFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images South America/Getty Images for Concordia Ameri\n\nTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President – US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn – are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well.\n\nAugust 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primaries\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\n\nThe GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain “yes” when asked whether they thought Biden won a “constitutional majority in the Electoral College.”\n\nUltimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don’t earn that nod.\n\nVermont is the only state in the union that’s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy’s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state’s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That’s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he’s yet to announce his plans.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year.\n\nAugust 13: Hawaii primaries\n\nHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green State of Hawaii\n\nTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state’s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November.\n\nAugust 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary)\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Oliver Contreras/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTwo of Trump’s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President’s sway in the GOP.\n\nThere is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump’s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney’s favor are her family’s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump’s support.\n\nMurkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska’s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state’s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before – winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski’s bid.\n\nAugust 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.\n\nThree Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis’ rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida’s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.\n\nBefore DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP’s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he’s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida’s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.\n\nThe outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles.\n\nSeptember 6: Massachusetts primaries\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump’s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump’s endorsement. But while Diehl won’t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn’t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn’t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they’ll avoid such a fate this November.\n\nSeptember 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primaries\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan Erin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP’s top targets in 2022, but the party’s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu’s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire’s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who’s received praise from McConnell.\n\nRedistricting is poised to make New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nThere will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor’s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden’s commerce secretary last year, and he’s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren’t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.\n\nNovember 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana", "authors": ["Terence Burlij Melissa Holzberg Depalo Ethan Cohen", "Terence Burlij", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Ethan Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/politics/senate-midterm-landscape-new-hampshire-republican-primary/index.html", "title": "Don Bolduc: Trump ally's victory in New Hampshire GOP primary ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans’ decision to nominate Don Bolduc to take on Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan locks in the final key matchup in November’s battle for control of the Senate.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army brigadier general who has embraced former President Donald Trump’s election denialism, will defeat state Senate President Chuck Morse, who has conceded. GOP Gov. Chris Sununu and national Republicans had rushed to defeat Bolduc, whom they viewed as a weaker general election candidate against Hassan.\n\nIn an evenly divided Senate, where Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to flip the chamber, Hassan is one of four key Democratic incumbents Republicans are looking to pick off this year. But as they have across the country, some candidates following in Trump’s footsteps in New Hampshire have raised concerns among GOP leaders because of their lackluster fundraising and hard-line right-wing rhetoric.\n\nThe primary in New Hampshire, which was thrown open after Sununu rebuffed national Republicans’ efforts to recruit him, has been a window into the GOP struggle that’s been waged across the political map over the spring and summer.\n\nBolduc, who lost a bid for the GOP Senate nod two years ago, had brought in just shy of $600,000 by August 24 compared to Hassan’s $31.4 million. He also has a penchant for saying controversial things, some of which he’s walked back. But in response, Sununu called Bolduc a “conspiracy-theorist-type candidate” and “not a serious candidate” in an interview with WGIR last month.\n\nIn a Sunday op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, Sununu wrote that “the stakes are too high for New Hampshire and America,” adding that Republicans needed a nominee “who will have the resources to compete in the most crucial battleground state in America.”\n\nStill, Republican voters again ignored establishment preferences and opted for the candidate who has aligned himself more closely with Trump, even if doing so comes at the cost of electability in November.\n\nA pre-primary season of recruiting misses by top Republicans left the party without what it viewed as its strongest candidates in key races – including governors like Sununu and Arizona’s Doug Ducey, who opted against taking on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Then, a summer of bruising Senate primaries – many of them shaped by Trump’s endorsements and pro-Trump voters’ demands for candidates who embrace his lies about election fraud – left Republicans fretting about the quality of the party’s nominees and scrambling to close Democrats’ fundraising advantage.\n\nRepublicans had hoped that inflation and the backlash new presidents historically have faced in midterm elections would carry the party to House and Senate majorities in November, delivering victories in competitive races across the map no matter the individual candidates in those races.\n\nBut gas prices have dropped. Biden and the Democratic-controlled Congress have enacted more of the President’s agenda. Democratic candidates have outpaced most of their GOP Senate rivals in fundraising. The FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has once again elevated a figure who galvanizes liberals and alienates suburban voters. And perhaps most significantly, the Supreme Court’s June decision to end federal abortion rights protections appears to have animated parts of the electorate that Democrats feared would slip away from the party or sit the midterms out.\n\nThe early signs of a more evenly matched midterm landscape came in Democratic victories in a special election in a bellwether House district in upstate New York and in Alaska’s ranked-choice special election for the state’s at-large House seat, which has been in GOP hands for nearly half a century, as well as voters’ overwhelming support for abortion rights in a referendum on the Kansas primary ballot.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of Republican candidates who won primaries, many with Trump’s backing, have struggled to expand their appeal to a broader electorate in critical states – including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Nevada – that could decide which party controls a Senate that is currently divided 50-50.\n\nGOP ups spending and focuses on crime\n\nAs GOP groups ramp up spending on television ads, their message in several key states is shifting away from attacking Biden on inflation. Instead, those ads target Democrats on crime and policing.\n\nThe latest example: In an ad launched Monday in Wisconsin, the National Republican Senatorial Committee labeled Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the Democrat challenging Sen. Ron Johnson, “dangerous” and a “defund the police Democrat.”\n\nBarnes, in his own ad launched two weeks ago, said Republicans are trying to scare voters, and that their charge that he wants to defund the police is “a lie.”\n\n“I’ll make sure our police have the resources and training they need to keep our communities safe, and that our communities have the resources to stop crime before it happens,” Barnes says in the spot.\n\nThe shifting strategy underscores how unsettled the playing field is in the battle for control of the Senate just eight weeks from the November 8 midterm elections.\n\nIn August, Republican campaigns and groups spent $25 million airing over 160 ads about inflation, while also spending about $11 million airing 80 ads about crime, according to AdImpact data. In just two weeks of September so far, Republicans have spent about $9 million airing 89 ads about inflation, while also spending about $9 million airing 54 ads about crime.\n\nIn Ohio’s key Senate race, Republican J.D. Vance launched an ad last week, saying, “Streets are exploding with drugs and violence, while liberals like [Democratic opponent] Tim Ryan attack and defund our police.”\n\nRyan has repeatedly distanced himself from “defunding the police.” In a recent ad in which he throws footballs at TV screens showing Republicans’ ads, he says, “Here come the culture wars; I’m not that guy,” as a football crashes into a screen showing the phrase “defund the police.”\n\nDemocratic Senate candidates have so far vastly outspent their Republican rivals in races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, forcing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell-aligned outside GOP groups to attempt to make up the difference. As the campaign season shifts into a new gear post-Labor Day, Senate Leadership Fund, for example, is set to massively ramp up its spending. The super PAC has placed nearly $200 million in ad reservations over the next two months, according to AdImpact data, the most of any political advertiser.\n\nIt’s picking up attacks in the crucial Pennsylvania Senate race, for instance, with an ad that highlights Democratic nominee John Fetterman’s support for various prison reforms, echoing, “far-left John Fetterman, dangerously liberal on crime.” Fetterman, like other Democratic nominees this year, has explicitly talked about funding the police.\n\nFEC filings from SLF last week showed it upping its commitment in several key states – adding $3.7 million to Pennsylvania, $3.7 million to Georgia, $3.5 million to North Carolina, $3 million to Ohio, $2.4 million to Wisconsin, and $2 million to Nevada. The additions will complement already massive reservations in battleground states. SLF had previously booked $38 million in Georgia, $33 million in Pennsylvania, $28 million in North Carolina, $27 million in Ohio, $19 million in New Hampshire, $16 million in Nevada, $15 million in Wisconsin, and $10 million in Arizona.\n\nThe GOP spending in North Carolina and Ohio underscores Democrats’ success in expanding the map of competitive races. Both seats are held by retiring Republican senators, and are must-wins for the GOP’s chances of winning the chamber in November.\n\nIn Florida, Democratic Rep. Val Demings has also outspent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Even though Rubio has long been favored to win reelection on the same ballot that features potential 2024 Republican presidential prospect Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking a second term, Demings’ nearly $25 million in TV ads has outpaced Rubio and Republicans by about a 4-to-1 margin. A big part of her message has been leaning into her experience as the former Orlando police chief to try to head off Republicans’ attempts to tie her to her party’s most liberal members. “I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police,” she said in one recent spot.\n\nDebate about debates\n\nSeveral key midterm match-ups are now in the midst of a debate about whether, when and how many times the candidates should debate – including in Pennsylvania, where Fetterman, the Democratic lieutenant governor who suffered a stroke this spring, has committed to only one show-down with Republican Mehmet Oz, who has sought five debates.\n\nFetterman has said he would only debate in October. He said in a statement that he always intended to debate Oz and that the hold-up has “only ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of the stroke, the auditory processing, and we’re going to be able to work that out,” but he didn’t provide specifics.\n\n“Let’s be clear - Dr. Oz’s campaign won’t agree to a SECRET debate. It has to be a REAL one with REAL journalists asking REAL questions. Sorry John - imaginary debates don’t count!,” Oz communications director Brittany Yanick said in response.\n\nWhile Oz’s team has been raising questions about Fetterman’s health, the Democrat has hammered Oz over past remarks calling abortion “murder,” with his allies warning Sunday that Oz would be a “rubber stamp” for a national ban.\n\n“Women are the reason we can win,” Fetterman said at a rally in the Philadelphia suburbs. “Don’t piss women off.”\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, former University of Georgia football star Herschel Walker, have engaged in a months-long debate about debates.\n\nWalker refused to participate in a debate during the GOP primary. Warnock has sought three debates, and Walker has said he’d debate Warnock on October 14 in Savannah. Warnock responded by saying he would debate Walker then, if Walker would accept another debate.\n\nA person familiar with the Republican candidate’s thinking told CNN last week that Walker is not going to agree to another debate, effectively sending both candidates back to square one.\n\nDebates typically drive news coverage of key races in their final weeks. The limited number in several key races, including Pennsylvania and Georgia, could increase the importance of television ads as the primary way of reaching voters – a reality that explains why McConnell and other top Republicans have increased outreach to major donors and urged senators to transfer campaign cash to the Senate Leadership Fund.\n\n“The Democrats are going to vastly outspend Republicans across the board. But as long as we have enough money to tell our story and to defend our opposition, I think we’ll be fine,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of McConnell’s leadership team, said last week.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner David Wright", "Eric Bradner", "David Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/politics/mitch-mcconnell-interview-midterm-cliffhanger/index.html", "title": "McConnell ignores Trump's attacks and says 'I have the votes' in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s become a throwaway line at former President Donald Trump’s campaign rallies: GOP senators must boot Mitch McConnell from the leadership position he’s held longer than any Republican in American history.\n\nBut McConnell has a message.\n\n“I have the votes,” the Senate GOP leader said bluntly, indicating he’s locked down enough support to claim a new feat: The longest-serving Senate party leader ever, a record held by Democrat Mike Mansfield for more than four decades and which McConnell would surpass in the next Congress.\n\nYet whether he’s in the minority or majority next year – and if he continues to serve as GOP leader after 2024 – are different questions altogether.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNN, McConnell weighed in on his outlook for the high-stakes battle for control of the Senate and warned President Joe Biden about how his nominees would be handled in a GOP majority. The GOP leader expressed his preference for a new Nebraska senator, defended votes that put him at odds with Republicans in the 50-50 Senate and steered clear of Trump’s brazen personal attacks against him and his wife, Elaine Chao – in an apparent attempt to avoid a distracting fight with the former President before the midterms.\n\nAnd as Republicans grow nervous about their prospects of retaking the Senate, especially after allegations that Georgia Republican nominee Herschel Walker paid for a woman to have an abortion 13 years ago, the GOP leader indicated his belief that the battle for the majority is a true “cliffhanger” and that it’s too early to know if the 2022 cycle will turn into a GOP debacle like 2010 and 2012 when lackluster general-election candidates cost his party a serious shot at the Senate majority.\n\n“It was clearly a challenge in 2010 and 2012, with Sharron Angle, Christine O’Donnell, Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock,” McConnell said, referring to GOP candidates in Nevada, Delaware, Missouri and Indiana, respectively, who lost general election matchups. “So it was clearly a problem in 2010 and 2012. Whether it’s a challenge, whether it’s fatal or a big problem this year, we’ll find out” next month.\n\nMcConnell, who has been devoting enormous time to ensure his high-spending super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, continues to spend staggering sums across the airwaves in the final weeks of the midterm elections, indicated that he plans to stand by the anti-abortion Walker who has denied stunning allegations that one of the mothers of his four children had an abortion at his request.\n\n“I think we’re going to stick with Walker and all the effort we put in through SLF, we’re going take it all the way to the end,” McConnell said when asked if he had concerns about the revelations, arguing instead he believed the election would turn on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock’s alliance with Biden.\n\n“I talk to him fairly often,” McConnell said of Walker, the former football star and novice candidate pushed into the race by Trump and backed by the GOP leader in the primary. “I think they’re going to hang in there and scrap to the finish.”\n\nWhile McConnell and Trump have been at sharp odds since the GOP leader cast him as “practically and morally responsible” for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, despite voting to acquit him at his impeachment trial, the Senate GOP leader has taken pains to avoid mentioning the former President or engage in a tit-for-tat with Trump and his powerful megaphone. In a recent tirade on his social media page, Trump said McConnell has “a death wish,” attacking his votes on unspecified bills and saying the GOP leader is “willing to take the country down with him.”\n\n“I don’t have anything to say about that,” McConnell said about the attack against him, his first response to the episode.\n\nIn the same post, Trump issued a racially charged attack against Chao, a naturalized American citizen who was born in Taiwan and also served as Trump’s secretary of transportation, calling her McConnell’s “China loving wife, Coco Chow.”\n\nAsked if the racist comment about his wife was acceptable, McConnell did not want to respond to it.\n\n“The only time I’ve responded to the President, I think, since he left office is when he gave me my favorite nickname – Old Crow – which I considered a compliment and after all, it was Henry Clay’s favorite bourbon.” He declined to comment further on the matter.\n\n(The interview was conducted Friday before a member of his conference, Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, made racially charged remarks at a Trump rally over the weekend.)\n\nWith less than a month to the midterms, the GOP leader knows full well that a back-and-forth with the former President could distract the party’s focus at a crucial time. And for McConnell, he says he’s not concerned that a growing number of Republicans act like Trump rather than hew to the traditional GOP orthodoxy espoused by the likes of Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her Wyoming primary this year after her battle over Trump’s “stolen” election lies. His only goal, he said, is winning elections.\n\n“I don’t have a litmus test,” McConnell said when asked if he wants a party more in line with Trump or with Cheney. “I’m for people that get the Republican nomination, and for winning, because if we win we get to decide what the agenda is, and they don’t.”\n\nThen-President Donald Trump listens to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speak about legislation for additional coronavirus aid in the Oval Office at the White House in July 20. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nMcConnell’s future atop his conference\n\nBut Trump doesn’t get a vote in a secret-ballot election in the Senate after the November midterms, and McConnell’s reelection to the top post is virtually a lock – whether they win or lose in next month’s elections, according to interviews with more than two dozen GOP senators.\n\nYet publicly and privately, the interest in his Senate seat – and his leadership post – has begun to sprout. On Capitol Hill, the timing of McConnell’s decision of when he may step aside as leader could have a profound impact on the leadership race to succeed him. That’s because the current whip – John Thune of South Dakota – is term limited in the No. 2 position at the end of the next Congress.\n\nIf McConnell were to step aside from his top position at the end of 118th Congress, which ends in January 2025, it could give Thune a leg-up in a secret-ballot election. But if McConnell waits for longer to step aside, the next No. 2 could be seen as a frontrunner in the race.\n\nAs they await McConnell’s decision, his potential successors-in-waiting are signaling interest in the top job if the GOP leader steps aside.\n\n“Well, sure,” Thune said when asked if he’s interested in the GOP leaders’ job when McConnell steps aside. “I mean, who wouldn’t be, right?”\n\n“If there’s an opportunity, that’s something I would be interested in pursuing,” said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a former GOP whip and current member of McConnell’s leadership team.\n\n“I’m going to continue to serve the conference in any way that they feel is useful,” Sen. John Barrasso, the Wyoming Republican and currently the No. 3 in leadership, said when asked if he’s interested in running for leader.\n\nThere are signs that McConnell could be preparing for the end of his term. Last year, he backed an effort in the state legislature to change Kentucky law on how successors to Senate seats could be named. The new McConnell-backed law would require the governor – who is currently a Democrat – to pick a successor from the same political party as the departing senator.\n\nPrivately, there’s interest in his seat from his state’s US House delegation, including Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican who has privately expressed serious interest in the seat if it opens up, according to sources close to the GOP congressman, with the domain name “BarrForSenate” already secured in case he decides to run. Other members of the delegation have kept the option open as well.\n\nIn the interview, the 80-year-old McConnell put to rest speculation that he might cut his current Senate term short and quit after the next Congress. His term ends in January 2027.\n\n“Oh, I’m certainly going to complete the term I was elected to by the people of Kentucky, no question about that,” McConnell said of the seat he’s held since 1985.\n\nBut asked if he would stay as the Republican leader through his current Senate term, McConnell wouldn’t say.\n\n“I’m not going to go there,” the GOP leader said. “I’m confident I’ll be reelected to another two-year term.”\n\nOn his preference for a potential successor for the leadership job, McConnell would only say: “I think there are plenty of people who could step in and do this job.”\n\nAnd he brushed back a question about whether he has made a decision about running again.\n\n“I’m in the second year of my term, for God’s sake,” the GOP leader said.\n\nBut even though polls in Kentucky have long shown his popularity lagging, Republicans in the state say he could win again if he wants to run – despite his battle with Trump.\n\n“The thing about Mitch McConnell: his polling has never been really good,” said Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican. “But he’s such a good politician that on Election Day, he always makes sure that his opponent is less popular than he is.”\n\nComer added: “He’s a vicious politician in battle, and that has served him well over the years.”\n\nMaintaining support within his conference will be essential to keeping his leadership position. While most Republicans indicated they back the GOP leader maintaining his leadership post, several Republican senators declined to commit, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, John Kennedy of Louisiana, fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul and Rick Scott of Florida, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman who has been at odds with McConnell over strategy this year.\n\n“There’ll be an election and we’ll figure it out,” Scott said when asked if he’d back McConnell again.\n\nMcConnell, for his part, said this when asked if he had confidence in the job Scott is doing at the NRSC: “I don’t have any criticism of Rick. I think they’re doing the best they can.”\n\nMcConnell’s fingerprints are all over both the Senate races at play in the midterms and over potential newcomers as well. In Nebraska, where Sen. Ben Sasse just made known his plans to resign by year’s end and take a job as the president of the University of Florida, McConnell has made his preference for Sasse’s successor known. He has personally urged the outgoing Nebraska governor, Pete Ricketts, to seek the seat, calling him a “great choice.”\n\n“I’ve talked to Gov. Ricketts,” McConnell said. “We’re hoping that he will end up in the Senate. Exactly how that happens under Nebraska law is yet to be determined.”\n\n“If that were the way it worked out I think it’d be a smooth transition,” McConnell added of Ricketts taking the spot.\n\nRicketts said in a statement that he would leave the appointment decision to the next governor but didn’t express whether he had interest in seeking the seat.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell waits to be sworn-in with his wife Elaine Chao, then-Secretary of Transportation, at the US Capitol on January 3, 2021. Samuel Corum/Pool/Getty Images\n\nWarning to Biden\n\nBut if Republicans take back the Senate, McConnell would find himself again as majority leader in opposition to a Democratic President – as he was with then-President Barack Obama after the 2014 midterms.\n\nIn a career-defining move already being felt across American society, McConnell took the unprecedented step and refused in 2016 to hold a vote on Merrick Garland, Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court, keeping open the seat for more than a year and allowing Trump to shift the balance of the court markedly to the right with the selection of conservative Neil Gorsuch.\n\nIn the interview, McConnell declined to say if he would even consider holding a vote on a Biden Supreme Court nominee should a vacancy arise next year in a GOP majority. Instead, he warned that Biden must talk to Republicans as he goes about making any number of executive and judicial branch appointments.\n\n“Many of the appointments the President has made during the first two years have been quite extreme,” McConnell said. “I’m not just talking about judges. I’m talking about the boards and commissions. And I think our view would be on appointments that we need to talk about it more and maybe have some recommendations to make ourselves before going down that path.”\n\nMcConnell said Republicans and the White House “need to talk about appointments, rather than just reacting to them.”\n\nIf Republicans take back the majority, McConnell has contended that they would “look for things within the 40-yard-line.” But that proposition will be quickly put to the test, with some House Republicans already talking about potentially impeaching Biden and launching an inquiry against his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nThe GOP leader would not say if he believes House Republicans should tamp down that impeachment talk.\n\n“I don’t have any advice to give the House Republicans,” he said, instead arguing that a GOP majority would turn Biden into a moderate.\n\nBut even as he and Biden cut fiscal deals in the Obama presidency, and much was said about their close relationship, the two barely talk, with McConnell saying: “I don’t even remember” the last time they spoke. “It’s been a while.”\n\nMitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, speaks late last month during a new conference following the weekly Republican caucus luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMcConnell in the 50-50 Senate\n\nDuring this Congress, the longest period of a 50-50 Senate in the nation’s history, McConnell has battled party-line Democratic efforts to pass their Covid-19 relief legislation and the climate-and-health law, but he’s had had a hand in some of the biggest bipartisan achievements of Biden’s time in office. He endorsed a major infrastructure law, the first gun violence legislation in a generation and a measure to bolster production of semi-conductor chips – all issues that put him at odds with a majority of his conference, House Republican leaders and Trump himself.\n\nSen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, said “yes” he had concerns with the GOP leader’s positions on those issues.\n\n“Can you recall any Democrat has ever voted on a Republican proposal?” Braun asked, while also criticizing the GOP leader for not putting forward an election-year agenda for Republicans to discuss on the campaign trail.\n\n“I think if you’re going to appeal to independents, and they hold the political power in this country, they want something more than ‘I’ll tell you after the election,’ ” Braun said.\n\nMcConnell contends that even when he was majority leader, he didn’t ascribe to the notion that every bill must be supported by a majority of Senate Republicans before he put it on the floor. And when Obama was President, he cut three fiscal deals with Biden – even though it got pushback from many in his party.\n\n“I never think it’s to the advantage of the country or my party to be perceived as unwilling to do anything at all,” McConnell said in defending his approach.\n\nGetting back to the majority and setting the agenda would require a one-seat net pickup, but that has proven to be an enormous challenge given the difficult Senate map his party faces – despite the favorable midterm environment for the GOP.\n\nBy the end of the cycle, McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund will have spent $209 million in ads across the country, with its affiliated nonprofit group, One Nation, spending another $71 million, according to data from AdImpact.\n\n“He has raised the overwhelming amount of money that is supporting Republican candidates across the country,” Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said. “He has done his job.”\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, his group has not opted to spend sizable sums to bolster GOP candidate Blake Masters in Arizona, though McConnell contends that is the result of a discussion over “resource allocation” with a major Republican donor, Peter Thiel, and his outside group, looking at that race instead. Masters, he said, has a “good chance of winning.”\n\n“I’ve got a lot of bases to cover,” he said, pointing to the key battleground states across the map.\n\n“Many of these general election campaigns have been woefully underfunded, not because of the NRSC, but because of the candidates’ campaigns themselves,” McConnell said. “And we certainly – SLF has certainly – carried the lion’s share of load.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/pennsylvania-north-carolina-primary-election/index.html", "title": "Dr. Oz: High-stakes Pennsylvania GOP primary that could shape ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Republican primary for Pennsylvania’s US Senate race, which could be key to determining control of the chamber in November, was too close to call early Wednesday as Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick battled for the top spot with thousands of mail-in ballots still to be counted.\n\nThe race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey had been dominated by millions of dollars in negative advertising, mostly between Oz, the celebrity doctor backed by former President Donald Trump, and McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, and their allies.\n\nIn the final days before Tuesday’s primary, political commentator Kathy Barnette had appeared poised for a late surge as she tried to claim the “Make America Great Again” label, attempting to channel concerns about Oz’s conservative bona fides among Trump supporters. But by early Wednesday, Barnette was trailing in third place.\n\nWhile Oz held a razor-thin lead Wednesday morning, advisers to McCormick were confident of their candidate’s path to victory.\n\n“Based on how many uncounted absentee ballots there are and the margin by which Dave has won them so far, that’s why we are confident of victory. Dave will win this race,” Jeff Roe, chief strategist to the McCormick campaign, wrote in an overnight message on Twitter.\n\nAn adviser to Oz pointed to ballots yet to be counted in Philadelphia, where the candidate currently holds a double-digit edge, as well as several counties across the eastern edge of the commonwealth where he is leading McCormick.\n\n“It’s a jump ball,” the Oz adviser told CNN.\n\nPennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke last week that kept him in the hospital for the final days of the primary, will win the Democratic nod for Senate, CNN projected Tuesday. His victory over moderate Rep. Conor Lamb is a win for progressive Democrats in a race that represents the party’s best chance of flipping a seat this fall.\n\nIt appeared to be a mixed night for the former President, who has been preoccupied with trying to pick winners in midterm contests ahead of a possible 2024 White House bid. One of the candidates he backed in an 11th-hour endorsement – Pennsylvania Republican Doug Mastriano, who championed his election lies – will win the gubernatorial nod in the Keystone State, CNN projected.\n\nBut one of Trump’s acolytes in Congress, North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn, was ousted after a fierce campaign to unseat him by some of his fellow Tar Heel Republicans – proving that Trump isn’t enough of a lifeline to rescue the most controversial candidates.\n\nIn Idaho, incumbent GOP Gov. Brad Little will win reelection, CNN projected, fending off an unusual challenge from his lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, whom Trump had endorsed.\n\nElection denier wins Pennsylvania gubernatorial primary\n\nIn a state that was pivotal to the 2020 election, Mastriano is seeking an office that would allow him sway over the state’s electors in the 2024 presidential contest. He will face Democrat Josh Shapiro, the current state attorney general, in November.\n\nIn a taste of the bruising race to come, Shapiro immediately put out a statement Tuesday night calling Mastriano “a dangerous extremist who wants to take away our freedoms,” charging that the Republican would seek to “restrict the vote and spread conspiracy theories.”\n\nMastriano took a leading role in amplifying those false claims, and spent more than $3,000 from his campaign account to charter buses to Washington ahead of the January 6, 2021, “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the attack on the US Capitol, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Mastriano condemned the violence in a video posted on Facebook, but video and pictures from the event show him near the Capitol, raising questions about his involvement.\n\nIn his victory speech Tuesday night, Mastriano rejected the “extreme” label, arguing that Democrats’ Covid-19 public health measures were extreme.\n\n“On day one, any mandates are gone. On day one, any jab for job requirements are gone,” he said to cheers. “There is a movement here that is going to shock the state this November.”\n\nMadison Cawthorn loses\n\nCawthorn, the controversial freshman congressman backed by Trump, conceded his North Carolina primary to state Sen. Chuck Edwards on Tuesday evening, according to Cawthorn’s spokesperson.\n\nCawthorn’s concession marked a stunningly quick fall for a young conservative once viewed as a potential star within the GOP after he succeeded Mark Meadows, who left Congress to become chief of staff to Trump.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis had backed Edwards, telling CNN it was the first time in his career that he’d opposed a sitting Republican.\n\nEdwards confirmed the concession call in remarks to supporters Tuesday night.\n\n“I received a call from Congressman Cawthorn just a few minutes ago. Just as I expected, he presented himself in a very classy and humble way and offered his support to our campaign in absolutely anyway that we can use him.”\n\nIn North Carolina’s Senate race, Rep. Ted Budd will win the GOP nomination to replace retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, CNN projected Tuesday.\n\nTrump endorsed Budd nearly a year ago, but his candidacy was slow to take off and he struggled to break away from former Gov. Pat McCrory and Rep. Mark Walker in the primary. Heavy spending from the Club for Growth’s political action committee ultimately boosted the conservative congressman, who backed voting to toss out the electoral results in Arizona and Pennsylvania in January 2021.\n\nDemocrat Cheri Beasley, who was the first Black woman to lead the North Carolina Supreme Court as chief justice, will be the party’s Senate nominee in the state, CNN projected Tuesday. Her main rivals had dropped out of the primary before Tuesday.\n\nA test for Biden too\n\nFarther west, Democrats are closely watching a House primary in Oregon’s newly drawn 5th Congressional District, where Rep. Kurt Schrader is fending off a challenge from his left from Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who has received a relatively modest boost from progressive outside groups, led by the Working Families Party.\n\nSchrader, who was President Joe Biden’s first congressional endorsement of 2022, has angered some of his fellow Democrats by voting against the American Rescue Plan, Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, and a measure in the President’s Build Back Better package to allow the government to negotiate the price of pharmaceutical drugs, which would dramatically lower prices.\n\nSchrader pushed an alternative provision and ultimately voted for the full bill, but not before joining a group of nine moderates in an effort to decouple it from the bipartisan infrastructure bill – a tactical step that ultimately helped doom Build Back Better, Biden’s would-be signature legislation – in the Senate.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the potential historic significance of Barnette winning the Pennsylvania Senate seat.

A hurricane warning is in effect for the northwest Bahamas as the storm is expected to be at or near hurricane strength when it passes near or over the northwest Bahamas and reaches Florida’s east coast late Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n“Regardless of Nicole’s exact intensity, the storm’s large size will likely cause significant wind, storm surge, and rainfall impacts over a large portion of the northwestern Bahamas, Florida, and the southeastern coast of the United States during the next few days,” the center said in an advisory Monday.\n\nAreas south of Tampa – some of which are still trying to recover from Hurricane Ian’s destruction in September – could get drenched with 2 to 4 inches of rain.\n\nOrlando could get 1 to 2 inches of rain, and areas south of Jacksonville could be hit with 1 to 4 inches.\n\nAhead of the storm, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents Sunday to take precautions.\n\n“I encourage all Floridians to be prepared and make a plan in the event a storm impacts Florida,” DeSantis said in a news release.\n\nDeSantis said residents should prepare for an increased risk of coastal flooding, heavy winds, rain, rip currents and beach erosion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Election Day, much of the Florida Peninsula can expect breezy to gusty conditions. Chances of rain are expected to increase throughout the day for central and eastern cities such as Miami north to Daytona Beach and inland toward Orlando and Okeechobee.\n\n“Conditions may deteriorate as early as Tuesday and persist into Thursday night/Friday morning,” the National Weather Service in Miami said.\n\n“Impacts to South Florida may include rip currents, coastal flooding, dangerous surf/marine conditions, flooding rainfall, strong sustained winds, and waterspouts/tornadoes.”\n\nDeSantis said officials are coordinating with local emergency management authorities across the state’s 67 counties.\n\nThe goal is to “identify potential resource gaps and to implement plans that will allow the state to respond quickly and efficiently ahead of the potential strengthening” of the storm system, the statement said.\n\nWill the storm delay moon rocket launch?\n\nNASA is monitoring the situation ahead of its plan to launch moon rocket Artemis next week, but is keeping the rocket out on its launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center for now, the agency said Monday.\n\n“Teams at Kennedy will continue to monitor the weather, make sure all personnel are safe, and will evaluate the status of the Monday, Nov. 14, launch attempt for the Artemis I mission as we proceed and receive updated predictions about the weather,” NASA said in a statement.\n\nThis is the second time in six weeks that a powerful storm has threatened the first test flight of the most powerful rocket ever built. At the end of September, Hurricane Ian forced NASA to roll the rocket back to the safety of its garage, known as the Vertical Assembly Building, after two failed launch attempts due to a hydrogen leak and other technical issues.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall September 28 as a strong Category 4 storm on the west coast of the Florida peninsula, packing winds of nearly 150 mph.\n\nThe ferocious storm killed at least 120 people in Florida, destroyed many homes and leveled small communities.

Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Sunday, warning residents that even if the storm weakens before landfall, it would “still have significant impacts.”\n\nCNN Weather\n\nFloridians can expect “heavy rains, strong winds, flash flooding, storm surge and even isolated tornadoes,” the governor said. But the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management was particularly focused on the storm surge threat, cautioning that whatever surge develops while Ian is a major hurricane could persist as it nears land, even if the storm weakens.\n\n“We could see a situation where we have Cat 4 storm surge and potentially a Cat 1 or 2 hurricane landfall,” Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\nAnne Bink, associate administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery, kept the message simple: “Prepare now.”\n\nFlorida residents should know their evacuation routes and have preparedness kits that can last them at least three days, Bink told CNN. “Things like food, water, battery chargers for your phone. Even things like your insurance documents – take pictures of them so you have them with you,” Bink said.\n\n“We expect rapid intensification with this storm,” Bink said. “My message is: Please take this seriously, and please listen to your local officials.”\n\nIn the meantime, Ian is expected to be a major hurricane by the time it passes near or over western Cuba, the hurricane center said Sunday morning, and forecasters are becoming more confident residents there will face life-threatening storm surge and hurricane force winds.\n\nAs of Sunday night, Ian was about 160 miles south of Grand Cayman and about 430 miles southeast of western Cuba.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Grand Cayman and several Cuban provinces, including Isla de Juventud, Pinar del Rio and Artemisa, while a tropical storm warning has been issued for the provinces of La Habana, Mayabeque and Matanzas.\n\nThe Cayman Islands government has issued tropical storm watches for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, according to the hurricane center.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible across Cuba on Monday afternoon, and hurricane conditions will likely follow late Monday into Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Ian is forecast to bring 6 to 10 inches of rain with isolated totals up to 16 inches possible in western Cuba. That could contribute to flash flooding or even mudslides in areas of high terrain. And storm surge is forecast along the coast of western Cuba from Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the hurricane center, Ian will keep its major hurricane status as it moves north through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFlorida readies for potential hurricane, flooding and winds\n\nAuthorities in Florida are distributing sandbags and asking Floridians to prepare their property to reduce the risk of storm damage and to stock up on supplies like radios, water, canned food and medication. Residents should also pack up important documents and know their evacuation routes.\n\n“This is the calm before the storm,” Naples Mayor Teresa Heitmann told CNN on Saturday. “We experience this kind of adrenaline before a storm and the path could change at any time, but we want our citizens to be ready.”\n\nDeSantis echoed that Sunday, telling reporters at his news conference, “It’s better to be prepared and not have to use those preparations.”\n\nTo that end, DeSantis on Saturday expanded an emergency order to include every county in the state, saying conditions are “projected to constitute a major disaster.” President Joe Biden declared an emergency for Florida and ordered federal assistance to supplement response efforts. On Sunday, DeSantis announced 2,500 National Guardsmen had been activated ahead of the storm.\n\nSt. Petersburg, southwest of Tampa, is in a vulnerable position as a “peninsula within a peninsula within a peninsula,” Mayor Kenneth Welch told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday.\n\nDespite the storm’s unpredictable course, Welch said he’s encouraging residents to prepare emergency provisions for at least a week.\n\n“As we’re watching the storm, certainly praying it continues to move west, we at the same time are asking folks to prepare, make sure they have a plan, know their evacuation zone, take care of those things like food and water for seven days,” Welch said.\n\nAny evacuation orders will be given at least 72 hours in advance, the mayor said.\n\nIn Daytona Beach, Bethune-Cookman University issued a mandatory evacuation order and canceled classes Monday with plans to resume online Tuesday. Concerns over Ian’s arrival have also delayed the Artemis I rocket’s third launch attempt planned for Tuesday. And in Cape Coral, Mayor John Gunter said the city’s emergency operation center was operating at an “enhanced level.”\n\n“Right now, of course, we are like many other cities,” Gunter said. “We’re preparing for the worst.

This is the primary reason Miami-Dade County residents are asked to evacuate before a hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n“We’re outside of the cone of uncertainty. We can’t relax,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told CNN on Saturday. “We know there’s always a possibility it will shift. The storm has continued to move westward. This is the time everyone should make sure they have a plan.”\n\nLevine Cava urged residents to ensure they have enough food and water and check their storm surge planning zone.\n\n“We’re very hopeful that even with a major rain event, we’ll be able to manage it,” she said. “We’re on standby. We have extra pumps, and we’ve worked with the South Florida Water Management District to lower canal levels.”\n\nMiami-Dade County is preparing its “extensive shelter system,” including for those fleeing the Florida Keys if evacuations are ordered there.\n\nHeitmann is already seeing lines at the gas stations in Naples as residents brace for the potential hurricane, she said.\n\n“They’re taking it serious, and I encourage those that are not to always take a storm serious, because you can never estimate where that storm might turn. And we need to be prepared and if it’s not coming directly for us, it might have strong winds,” Heitmann said.\n\nIn Sarasota, authorities are checking on generators, planning with local police, trying to estimate how much flooding is possible and warning residents to be prepared, Mayor Erik Arroyo told CNN.\n\n“Don’t underestimate the dangers that come with gusts, with storm surges, with flooding, especially us being a coastal city.

Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home. CNN\n\nThe walk from the shoreline of Sanibel Island to Emig and Paskaly’s home was less than a mile along a windy, sandy road. On the way, the couple saw a familiar bright blue street sign lying mangled in the mud in a pile of twisted gutters, blankets and branches. They also passed a large banyan tree that had many of its branches twisted and snapped, with one large branch lying in front of a neighbor’s garage.\n\nAs they neared their home, Paskaly said with a heavy sigh: “I’m afraid to turn the corner.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly saw this mangled sign on Sanibel Island as the couple returned to check on their home. CNN\n\nSanibel’s reopening to residents came the same day President Joe Biden visited Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, was also briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nStatewide, more than 270,000 customers still have no power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties. Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers.

CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida.

Twenty-four deaths were recorded in Charlotte County – up from 12.\n\nHurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of eight people in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County and one each in Lake, Hardee, Hendry, Hillsborough and Polk counties, officials said. Four other people died in storm-related incidents as Ian churned into North Carolina.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been rescued from Hurricane Ian’s path in parts of southwest and central Florida since last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said Sunday.\n\nNow, as blue skies return, Floridians who took shelter while the hurricane raged have emerged – many of them still without power or clean drinking water – to find their communities unrecognizable.\n\nMore than 491,000 homes, businesses and other customers in Florida still did not have power as of Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. In Fort Myers Beach, where search crews are going through the rubble one house at a time, power may not be restored for 30 days due its electrical infrastructure being destroyed, Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nThe National Guard will be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to assess the damage and start working on restoring power, DeSantis said.\n\nMany residents are without clean tap water, with well over 100 boil-water advisories in places around the state, according to Florida Health Department data.\n\nLIVE UPDATES\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex by the powerful hurricane, landing in his neighbor’s yard. And the water brought someone’s car into his own backyard. He doesn’t know who it belongs to or how to remove it.\n\nAs crews in Naples comb through the wreckage to make sure no one is still trapped, residents face the enormous task ahead of cleaning up and restoring the city, Jay Boodheshwar, city manager of Naples, told CNN.\n\n“People need to take care of their emotional and mental health, because we’re really going to need to work together on this,” Boodheshwar said.\n\nNaples received record-high storm surge, when the hurricane sent rising ocean water flooding into the city’s streets and tearing through its infrastructure.\n\n“The amount of water that we received and the height of the surge affected a lot of the infrastructure,” Boodheshwar said. “So there are transformers that are fried. It is not simply rehanging lines. There are things that may need to be replaced.”\n\nA man stands in front of a home damaged by storm surge in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Naples, Florida. Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nIn Lee County, Desjarlais said officials cannot stop residents from coming home, but with no water or electricity and with extensive damage, it’s not safe.\n\nSimilar scenes are playing out in other communities. Hurricane Ian – expected to be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history – devastated neighborhoods from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nIn some cases, emergency workers out searching for signs of life are at the same time contending with losing their own homes.\n\n“Some of the guys on Pine Island, they lost everything, but they’re doing what they can,” said emergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who was preparing to join first responders on a rescue mission Sunday near decimated Sanibel Island and Pine Island.\n\nAnd the flooding isn’t over yet.\n\nSeminole County continues to experience significant flooding in certain neighborhoods, with families being rescued from waist-high waters over the weekend.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameraman rushes to help family during live report 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDays after the hurricane left, flooding continues to increase in areas near the St. Johns River, Lake Monroe, and Lake Harney, with an additional 100 homes suffering floodwater damage over the last 24 hours, Seminole County emergency management officials told CNN affiliate WESH.\n\nQuestions over timing of evacuation orders as deaths mount\n\nLee County officials have faced criticism about why the first mandatory evacuations weren’t ordered until a day before Ian’s landfall, despite an emergency plan which suggests evacuations should have happened earlier.\n\nDeSantis has said Lee County officials acted appropriately when they issued their first mandatory evacuations on Tuesday, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Ian made landfall on the barrier island Cayo Costa, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDesjarlais said the county made the decision to evacuate at the earliest time possible.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that so many people chose not to evacuate,” he said. “You know, I think I told you the other day we had room for 40,000 people in our shelters, but only 4,000 showed up, which means that people made the conscious choice not to evacuate, and it is regretful and you know, no one feels worse than we do about all that.”\n\nBut people are “used to longer evacuation orders,” Shawn Critser, a pastor in Fort Myers Beach, told CNN Monday. “But we got it the day before.”\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, Critser believed – like many others – that the heaviest impacts would be felt farther to the north, near Tampa Bay. But then the forecast was revised, showing the storm’s track shifting to the south.\n\n“When that evacuation order came, we’re like, ’24 hours, that’s not a lot. But we’ll still kind of make it,’” Critser said. “And it wasn’t until Wednesday morning when we woke up and saw that it had made another adjustment. And at that point, it’s just too late.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Miracle': Captain tells incredible story about his boat during Hurricane Ian 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSheriff Marceno stood by the handling of the evacuation orders Monday, saying he was “confident in our county manager, our leaders, our governor, all of us in law enforcement that we got that message out at the right time.”\n\nHard-hit Sanibel Island will be ‘out of commission’\n\nHurricane Ian wiped away parts of the Sanibel Causeway, which connects Sanibel Island to the mainland, stranding residents as their only link became impassable.\n\nSearch and rescue personnel have been going door-to-door searching properties for anyone who may need to be evacuated, and nearly 100 members of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue continue to conduct rescue efforts along Southwest Florida’s Barrier Islands like Sanibel, Captiva and Pine Island.\n\nThe fire rescue team is helping evacuate residents, dispensing medicine, treating injuries, helping people get in touch with family and just providing hard-to-come-by information, said Capt. Michelle Steele, a medical specialist.\n\n“People aren’t getting a whole lot of information right now. So whatever we can offer, that’s what we’re here for,” Steele said.\n\nA man along with his dog prepares to be evacuated in a Florida Army National Guard helicopter in Pine Island, Florida.

It doesn’t have the basic infrastructure.”\n\nAmy Lynn was at her friend’s home on Sanibel Island when Ian hit, forcing her to hide in a closet with seven dogs, praying and holding the door shut as the hurricane roared outside.\n\nWhen she came out, the home had been badly damaged, with walls blown off, video showed.\n\n“I prayed for 6 solid hours and came to peace that it may be my time to go. It wasn’t. God is good. We made it out alive,” Lynn wrote on Facebook. “We lost everything. My car is gone. I haven’t seen my home on Sanibel. I’ve been told it’s destroyed.”\n\nLynn was thankful to be alive, but, she wrote, “This is so much more than devastating. The heart of the (Southwest Florida) coast is forever changed.”\n\nAuthorities will allow residents to return Wednesday by private boat but said they should look online first. Sanibel officials plan to post photos and information on whether the property is deemed destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe bridge to Pine Island was knocked out by the storm and the transportationdepartment hopes to have a temporary bridge in place by the end of the week, the governor said Monday.\n\n“This is not necessarily going to be a bridge you’re going to want to go 45 miles per an hour over, maybe, but at least you’ll have connectivity to the mainland,” DeSantis said.\n\nOfficials said food is being dropped at fire stations on Pine Island.\n\nPower could be out for weeks\n\nSome residents and businesses in storm-damaged counties may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because of the structural damage caused by the hurricane, said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nFPL expects to have power restored by Sunday to 95% of its 126,700 customers in Charlotte County, which includes Punta Gorda, Patrick Fuller, the county emergency management director said Monday.

Andrew West/USA Today Network Prev Next\n\n‘Anybody who lives near water’ should get flood insurance, FEMA chief says\n\nHurricane Ian could be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history, devastating communities from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nWhile Florida has more flood insurance policies than any other state, only about 13% of homes there have flood insurance, and only 18% who live in the counties that had mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders in place ahead of Ian, according to an analysis by actuarial firm Milliman.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Americans don’t have to live in a flood zone to benefit from flood insurance.\n\n“I think anybody who lives near water should certainly purchase flood insurance because it’s your No. 1 tool to help protect your family and your home after the storm,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said.\n\n“If you live near water or where it rains, it can certainly flood, and we have seen that (with) multiple storms this year.”\n\nShe said FEMA is in the process of updating its flood zone maps. “While in certain areas we require flood insurance, everybody has the ability to purchase flood insurance,” Criswell said\n\n“It is certainly in your best defense to help protect your property in the aftermath of any of these storms.”\n\nParts of Florida are now ‘unrecognizable’\n\nBut the most severe lashing took place in southwestern coastal cities like Fort Myers and Naples, where some neighborhoods were annihilated.\n\n“We’re flying and we’re operating in areas that are unrecognizable,” US Coast Guard Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson said.\n\n“There’s no street signs. They don’t look like they used to look like. Buildings that were once benchmarks in the community are no longer there.”\n\nMany of the Ian-related deaths have been reported in southwestern Florida’s Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Sanibel Island, where at least 42 people died.\n\n‘Unfortunately, people did get complacent’\n\nLocal officials are facing criticism about whether mandatory evacuations in Lee County should have been issued sooner.\n\nOfficials there did not order evacuations until less than 24 hours before the storm made landfall, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDeSantis defended the timing of Lee County’s orders, saying they were given as soon as the storm’s projected path shifted south, putting the area in Ian’s crosshairs.\n\n“As soon as we saw the model shift northeast, we did exactly what we could to encourage people to” evacuate, Lee County Commissioner Kevin Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“I’m just disappointed that so many people didn’t go to shelters, because they’re open.”\n\nRuane called the reporting about a possible delay in issuing a mandatory evacuation “inaccurate.” He said the county did what it was supposed to do, without providing any evidence that the reporting was inaccurate.\n\n“I think the most important thing that most people need to understand is we opened up 15 shelters. During Irma there were 60,000 people in our shelters. There’s 4,000 people in the shelters right now,” Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“Unfortunately, people did get complacent … As far as I’m concerned, the shelters were open, they had the ability, they had all day Tuesday, they had a good part of Wednesday as the storm was coming down – they had the ability to (go to a shelter).”\n\nThe US Coast Guard made plans to evacuate people from Lee County’s Pine Island on Sunday, according to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nIn addition to the 42 deaths in Lee County, Hurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of 12 people in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County, and one each in Polk, Lake, Hendry and Hillsborough counties, officials said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida, saying Hurricane Ian is “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history.”\n\nThe President and first lady Jill Biden are set to travel to Puerto Rico Monday to survey damage from Hurricane Fiona, then head to Florida on Wednesday.\n\n‘The houses … are all gone’\n\nMembers of mediccorps.org help evacuate Tom Acerbo on Pine Island, Florida, on Saturday. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian finished its devastating crawl over Florida, residents tried to venture back to their damaged or destroyed homes and sifted through debris.\n\nResidents from Sanibel and Captiva islands were cut off from mainland Florida after parts of a causeway were destroyed by the storm, leaving boats and helicopters as their only exit options.\n\nCivilian volunteers rushed to help residents on Sanibel, where some homes were obliterated.\n\nAndy Boyle was on Sanibel Island when the hurricane hit. He said he lost his home and two cars, but feels lucky to be alive.\n\n“A lot of people have very expensive, well-built homes on Sanibel, and they felt with their multi-million dollar homes built like fortresses, they would be fine,” he said.\n\nBoyle was riding out the storm at home when the dining room roof collapsed. “That’s when we started to get concerned,” he said.\n\nHe described waving down National Guard aircraft the next day outside his house, and seeing the scenes of devastation around the island.\n\n“When you go to the east end of the island, there’s just a lot of destruction. The houses surrounding the lighthouse are all gone. When you go to the west end of the island, the old restaurants up there, they’re all gone. The street going to Captiva is now a beach,” Boyle said.\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex and is now in his neighbor’s yard. And the water brought someone’s car into his own backyard. He doesn’t know who it belongs to or how to remove it.\n\nAnother neighbor, Joanne Fisher, told CNN she’s coping with some shock in the storm’s aftermath, but she is in clean-up and salvage mode. Her oven is filled with mud, and water still spills out of the kitchen cabinets.\n\n“I’m almost ready to cry right now talking to you,” Fisher said. “But it’s okay because we’re alive and we’re here. And that is the most important thing.”\n\nResidents were also evacuated from the Hidden River area of Sarasota County after a compromised levee threatened to flood homes, the sheriff’s office said Saturday.\n\nA man surveys his damaged trailer home Saturday in Matlacha, Florida. Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘We need everything’\n\nFurther complicating recovery is the lack of electricity and spotty communication in impacted areas.\n\nIt could take up to a week from Sunday before power is restored in storm-damaged counties, said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nAnd some customers may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because some buildings with structural damage will need safety inspections.\n\nIn Cape Coral, just southwest of Fort Myers, 98% of the city’s power structure was “obliterated” and will need complete reconstruction, Fire Department Chief & Emergency Management Director Ryan Lamb told CNN’s Jim Acosta.\n\nAround 65% of all power outages in Florida from the storm had been restored as of early Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nFlorida is also working with Elon Musk and Starlink satellite to help restore communication in the state, according to DeSantis.\n\n“They’re positioning those Starlink satellites to provide good coverage in Southwest Florida and other affected areas,” DeSantis said.\n\nEmergency responders in Lee County will be among those receiving Starlink devices.\n\nIn Charlotte County, residents are “facing a tragedy” without homes, electricity or water supplies, sheriff’s office spokesperson Claudette Smith said.\n\n“We need everything. We need all hands on deck,” Smith told CNN Friday. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear why this expert believes Hurricane Ian damage could have been prevented 03:54 - Source: CNN\n\nHurricane Ian may have caused as much as $47 billion in insured losses in Florida, according to an estimate from property analytics firm CoreLogic.

Coastal flooding, large waves and rip currents will extend from the tip of FL to NC,” the National Weather Service tweeted.\n\nNicole was very close to hurricane strength Tuesday night, with 70 mph sustained winds, and is expected to become a hurricane – meaning sustained winds of at least 74 mph – overnight. At 10 p.m. ET, it was about 325 miles east of West Palm Beach and moving west-southwest at about 10 mph.\n\nNicole’s tropical storm-force winds extend 380 miles from the center and are expected to be felt in Florida beginning late Wednesday morning.\n\nNicole is then due to produce heavy rain that could lead to dangerous storm surge and high winds Wednesday, said Jamie Rhome, the acting director of the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIt is projected to be a strong tropical storm or a Category 1 hurricane – with sustained winds of at least 74 mph – by the time it reaches Florida Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, Rhome said Monday in a video briefing posted online.\n\nUp to 7 inches of rain and storm surge that could rise up to 5 feet along the coast, combined with high winds, are mainly forecast for Wednesday evening and Thursday. And because the storm’s track shifted west late Tuesday, a storm surge watch is now in effect for the panhandle and some of the west coast, the center said.\n\n“The storm surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves. Residents in the warning area should listen to advice given by local officials,” the hurricane center said.\n\nOrlando International Airport will suspend operations as of 4 p.m. Wednesday “until circumstances permit operations resume,” the state’s busiest airport said Tuesday afternoon on Twitter.\n\nPalm Beach and Volusia counties have issued mandatory evacuation orders starting Wednesday morning for some residents. In Palm Beach, the order is in effect from 7 a.m. ET for zones A and B and include barrier islands and low-lying areas, according to a release on the county’s website.\n\nIn Volusia County, home to Daytona Beach, the order is in effect Wednesday at 10 a.m., including those east of the intracoastal waterway or in flood-prone areas, all campsites and RV parks and all mobile and manufactured homes.\n\n“Tropical Storm Nicole poses a direct threat to property and life,” County Manager George Recktenwald said on the Volusia County website. “Our infrastructure, especially along the coastline, is extremely vulnerable because of Hurricane Ian’s impacts. We expect further erosion along the beach, along with flooding in areas that were previously flooded by Ian. Residents need to take this storm seriously.”\n\nBrevard County on Tuesday issued an evacuation recommendation starting Wednesday for some residents, including people on the barrier islands, “including areas from Kennedy Space Center south beaches, and Merritt Island,” those in flood-prone areas, mobile and manufactured home residents, and people with special medical needs who are dependent on electricity.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nSoutheastern Florida is already experiencing some of the highest tides of the year, thanks to this month’s full moon. These tides will be pushed significantly higher by Tropical Storm Nicole’s approach, creating even higher water levels and more beach erosion for coastal communities on the east coast of the state during the next several high tide cycles, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe large and strengthening storm is creating a steady stream of onshore winds that will only increase as Nicole gets closer, pushing and piling the water on the shoreline, so that coastal flooding and beach erosion will be possible even before Nicole makes landfall.\n\n“These winds, high seas, and surf will combine with high astronomical tides to bring the threat of significant beach erosion around the times of the next several high tide cycles,” said the NWS in Melbourne.\n\nBut flooding in the state will not be limited to the immediate coastline, as heavy rainfall will lead to freshwater flooding well inland as well.\n\nThe St. John’s River in Florida still remains at Moderate Flood Stage from Hurricane Ian. Nicole’s passage and the resulting rainfall is expected to cause the water to rise once again on this slow-moving river, creating flooding concerns once again.\n\n“Levels are forecast to reach Major Flood Stage at 4.0 feet once again on Friday, remaining steady into the weekend. A higher rise is possible depending on rainfall totals as well as the northerly wind surge leading to a backup of water on Lake George,” the NWS said.\n\nMore than 5 million people are under a storm surge warning from North Palm Beach, Florida, north to Altamaha Sound, Georgia, including the mouth of the St. Johns River to Georgetown.\n\nThe storm is not expected to intensify rapidly like Ian did in late September before killing at least 120 of people in Florida and destroying communities still reeling from the destruction. No hurricane has hit the US in November since Hurricane Kate struck Florida as a Category 2 in 1985.\n\n“We’re not forecasting a major hurricane,” Rhome said. “Again, not an Ian situation, but still a potentially impactful system.”\n\nNearly 2 million people are now under a hurricane warning that extends from Boca Raton to the Flagler-Volusia County line; a hurricane watch runs north from there to Ponte Vedra Beach.\n\nNearly 15 million people are under a tropical storm warning – with conditions expected in the zone within 36 hours – from Hallandale Beach, Florida, north to Altamaha Sound, Georgia, plus Lake Okeechobee in southern Florida. And along the state’s west coast – from north of Bonita Beach to the Ochlockonee River – places slammed by Ian are now under tropical storm watches.\n\nA tropical storm watch was issued Tuesday for north of Altamaha Sound in Georgia to South Santee River in South Carolina, and a storm surge watch was issued from the Savannah River to the South Santee River in South Carolina and from the Suwannee River to the Ochlockonee River in Florida.\n\nA storm surge watch is in effect on the west coast along the Florida panhandle from the Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, the hurricane center said late Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor of Miami-Dade County urged residents to prepare for the storm.\n\n“Residents and visitors should monitor the forecast and make sure their storm kit is up-to-date,” Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said online. “We’re taking all needed precautions to prepare for potential flooding and power outages.”\n\nMiami-Dade County officials are not expecting the storm to impact Election Day, Levine Cava said.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Jennifer Gray", "Aya Elamroussi", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-live-updates-damage-forecast-florida/10457271002/", "title": "Hurricane Ian regained strength; death toll mounts: Recap", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Thursday, Sept. 29. For our latest coverage of Hurricane Ian, see updates from Friday, Sept. 30.\n\nClick here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nIan became a hurricane again Thursday evening after hammering Florida with heavy rains and powerful winds, leaving a rising death toll and thousands of residents desperately seeking rescue from the effects of one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history.\n\nThe large system, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm on its way out of Florida and into the Atlantic ocean, is expected to head toward the Carolinas and Georgia. Ian's sustained winds increased to 85 mph late Thursday and it could bring \"life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds'' to those states, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the storm caused a \"500-year flooding event\" and said Coast Guard helicopters were plucking trapped residents from the roofs of homes. Communities across the state were or will be swamped by the overwhelming waters, he said.\n\n\"The impacts of this storm are historic and the damage that has been done is historic,\" DeSantis said. \"We've never seen a flood event like this, we've never seen a storm surge of this magnitude.\"\n\nAt least 14 people were reported dead in counties across the state, a number that's expected to rise substantially. Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. More than 1.9 million Florida homes and businesses were without power Thursday evening.\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses thus far range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nEven after Ian had weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to the Atlantic early Thursday, its outer bands were still buffeting the state. The storm flooded entire communities, leaving residents stranded in their homes after making landfall Wednesday with 150-mph maximum sustained winds – just 7 mph shy of a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale.\n\nMajor to record flooding will continue across central Florida and considerable flooding is expected in portions of the Carolinas and southern Virginia through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm previously tore into Cuba, killing two people and bringing down the entire country's electrical grid.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►President Joe Biden declared an emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal assistance for the state, according to a White House statement. Ian is located about 185 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina, and is moving north-northeast at 10 mph, the hurricane center said late Thursday.\n\n►The U.S. Coast Guard was searching for a group of more than 20 Cuban migrants after their boat sank in stormy weather near the Florida Keys. A U.S. Border Patrol agent tweeted that nine have been rescued and that the search for the rest continues.\n\n►Ian’s strength at landfall tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane when measured by wind speed to strike the U.S. It's tied with five other hurricanes that reached 150 mph — two in Florida, two in Louisiana and one in Texas.\n\n►Waffle House, known for always being open, said 35 outlets were shut down due to the storm as of Thursday morning.\n\n►Residents described the terror after a tornado tore through a condominium complex near Delray Beach on the Atlantic side of South Florida, ripping off roofs and turning over vehicles. \"I felt things blow past my head and face,\" resident Jim Travis said. \"When I opened the door, my apartment was destroyed.\" Read more.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES : Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\n: Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian. HURRICANE IAN TRACKER: Where is Ian headed? See the map.\n\nReenergized Ian expected to make landfall in South Carolina\n\nLike a villain in a horror movie, Ian is coming back to wreak havoc just when it seemed to go away.\n\nOnce a Category 4 hurricane, Ian was a tropical storm as it moved Thursday off the coast of Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean, where the warm water reenergized it. In the afternoon, Ian once again became a hurricane — meaning it packs winds of at least 74 mph — and is expected to make landfall once again, this time Friday in South Carolina.\n\nHurricane and storm surge warnings have been issued for the South Carolina coast because of Ian's predicted approach, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nForecast call for a storm surge of several feet and flooding in low areas along the coast, like Charleston, where Mayor John Tecklenburg warned residents: “Take this storm seriously. Tomorrow, stay home and stay out of harm’s way.”\n\nCollapsed causeway, shark swimming on a street part of Ian's legacy\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast were devastated as Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nSanibel Island in Lee County, near where the hurricane made landfall, was among the hardest hit. Parts of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed, disconnecting the barrier island of 6,300 residents from the mainland.\n\n“Sanibel is destruction ... it got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said.\n\nSanibel Island officials said two people died as a result of the hurricane. At a Thursday night news conference, the officials said members of at least 200 households remained on the island during the storm. At least 40 uninjured people were evacuated and another 12 injured ones were taken to hospitals.\n\nIn Fort Myers, the water on the streets of one neighborhood was so deep a shark was seen swimming through it. In Cape Coral just to the south, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water.\n\nAbout 70 miles north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.\n\nAt least 14 deaths confirmed in Florida, toll expected to grow\n\nThe destruction and upheaval left behind by Ian has made it difficult to get an accurate assessment of the loss of life, but there are already reports of 14 deaths, and more are expected.\n\nTwo of them were reported by officials in Sanibel Island, where residents of at least 200 households declined to evacuate and rode out the storm.\n\nCharlotte County Commissioner Chris Constance told CNN Thursday afternoon there have been six confirmed fatalities in the county, which is just north of Fort Myers.\n\nAlso speaking to CNN, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said at least five deaths have been confirmed in his county, which includes Cayo Costa — the island near Cape Coral where the storm made landfall Wednesday.\n\nAnd a 72-year-old man in Deltona, about 30 miles northeast of Orlando, died after falling into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nConstance said four shelters in his county had to be evacuated because of structural damage, and many roads were impassable because of downed power lines or flooding.\n\n“It is the biggest catastrophe I have ever seen in my lifetime,” said Constance, speaking from Broward County in South Florida, where he traveled ahead of the storm. “This is unprecedented and I was in Punta Gorda through Hurricane Charley (in 2004). While that was devastating, this is so much bigger, is affecting so many more people.''\n\nBiden: Ian could be 'deadliest hurricane in Florida's history'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that Ian could be the “deadliest hurricane in Florida's history,” vowing the federal government will provide assistance “however long it takes” to ensure a full recovery.\n\n“The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life,” Biden said after he was briefed on FEMA’s disaster response at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.\n\nAt least 13 people were reported dead in counties across the state, though Florida officials have not provided an official death total from the storm. It wasn’t clear on what Biden based his estimate on the loss of life. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane killed up to 2,500 in Florida. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 killed 43 people.\n\n“We know many families are hurting today, and our entire country hurts with them.'' Biden said. \"My message to the people of Florida and to the country is that at times like these America comes together.”\n\nThe president said he offered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “the fullest federal support” in a phone conversation Thursday morning and told Florida mayors to “call me directly” if they need help.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHurricane Ian losses: $25-$40 billion\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses, mostly in Florida, range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nFitch said the losses could climb higher “depending on the effect of the storm in the Carolinas.” The storm made landfall Wednesday on the Gulf Coast and traveled across central Florida before exiting on Thursday as a tropical storm. It has since turned into a Category 1 storm and headed toward South Carolina.\n\nIn comparison to other storms, Fitch said Hurricane Katrina’s losses were $65 billion in 2005 and Hurricane Ida’s losses were $36 billion last year.\n\n- Sergio Bustos\n\nIan the 'ultimate villain' at Disney World; parks to start reopening Friday\n\nWhile Disney World was closed to guests Thursday as Ian swept across central Florida, some who were already staying at the park's resorts weathered the storm with limited staff and upset children.\n\nJan Tuckwood, who splits time between Lake Worth, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, said Disney's Swan Reserve hotel felt like the Twilight Zone to her and her family.\n\n\"Disney World is as you would imagine it to be if an incredible amount of children have been pent up for two days and basically had their hopes dashed by the ultimate villain, Hurricane Ian,\" she said.\n\nDuring the storm, water started leaking into their hotel room on the 14th floor and they were relocated to another room, she said.\n\nDisney officials said the parks were being assessed for damage Thursday and operations would resume in a phased approach Friday.\n\n– Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nErosion-control rocks tossed by high surf\n\nIn Flagler Beach, county emergency officials reported damage to the end of the pier as a result of the high and pounding surf, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said, adding that public reports indicated the surf was tossing erosion-control rocks over the beachside highway State Road A1A.\n\nAt Pellicer Creek near Marineland, the tide gauge reached a height of 4 feet over the high-water mark, which represents major flooding of the Intracoastal Waterway, as a result of storm surge. A Weatherstem camera showed flooding of the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience.\n\n-- Dinah Pulver\n\nIan as viewed through a peephole in North Port\n\nElizabeth Hayes watched the entirety of Hurricane Ian pass over her home in North Port, 50 miles northwest of Fort Myers, through a peephole in her shutters. The longtime resident says she was not prepared for the devastating flooding – and she knows more floodwater is on its way.\n\nHeyes said only the roof of her shed in the yard is above water. North Port residents are using small boats, kayaks and paddle boards to inspect homes that flooded along the Myakkahatchee Creek on Thursday morning.\n\n“We’ve seen it flood, we’ve boated in and out before, but this is devastating,” Hayes said.\n\nAirports closed, flights canceled\n\nMost Florida airports remained closed Thursday and numerous flights were canceled. Airports that are open are dealing with delays as well as cancellations.\n\nNearly 2,000 U.S. flights were canceled Thursday, and the highest numbers were across Florida, according to Flight Aware, which tracks flight status in real time. Travel through parts of Georgia and the Carolinas was also impacted as the storm moved north. Tampa International Airport officials tweeted that damage assessments were underway.\n\n\"We are closely coordinating our reopening with the FAA, TSA, airlines, and other partners based on roadway safety, facility readiness, and required staffing,\" the post said. \"We hope to have an update on reopening plans later today.\"\n\n– Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nSection of Sanibel Causeway crashes into sea\n\nA section of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed into San Carlos Bay, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people normally live. A mandatory evacuation order had been issued for the island ahead of the storm but authorities said about 200 households stayed behind.\n\nDeSantis said Thursday morning that more than 100 engineers in pairs of two will work to assess the bridges along the west coast of Florida.\n\nBiden issues disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration to make federal funding available to affected residents in the Florida counties of Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota. DeSantis said he would ask that the declaration be expanded as more counties report crippling damage from Ian.\n\nAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help residents and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding also is available for debris removal.\n\nBiden said his administration was \"continuing to take swift action to help the families of Florida. ... I want the people of Florida to know that we will be here at every step of the way.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg dodged worst of Ian\n\nAfter thousands of people evacuated earlier this week, preparing for life-threatening storm surge, residents in St. Petersburg awoke Thursday to minimal damage.\n\nPolice directed traffic at intersections with broken traffic lights. Some trees had fallen, blocking roadways and taking down power lines. In Coquina Key, an island community south of downtown, a Norfolk Island pine had snapped in half, its branches scattered in a yard. Nearby, Dale Fredrick used a chainsaw to cut branches of another downed tree blocking a roadway.\n\n“It won’t take long,” Fredrick, 58, said. “Just little by little.”\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nUSA TODAY's Hurricane Ian tracker will remain updated and offer the latest look at where the storm is headed.\n\nLee County sheriff fears 'hundreds' could be dead but DeSantis says nothing confirmed\n\nThe hurricane’s center made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of heavily populated Fort Myers in Lee County.\n\n\"While I don't have confirmed numbers, I definitely know the fatalities are in the hundreds,\" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said on ABC-TV's \"Good Morning America.\" \"There are thousands of people that are waiting to be rescued.\"\n\nPressed on the numbers, Marceno said, \"So far confirmed in the hundreds. Meaning that we are responding to events, drownings. Again, unsure of the exact details because we are just starting to scratch the surface on this assessment.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis attempted to downplay the sheriff's assessment, telling \"Good Morning America'' those numbers weren't verified.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\n“None of that is confirmed,” DeSantis said at a morning briefing at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “What that is, there were 911 calls from people in their homes saying, ‘Hey, the water is rising. I’m going to go up in the attic, but I’m really worried.’”\n\n“Of course, those folks now are going to be checked on,” DeSantis said. “I think you’ll have more clarity about that in the next day or so, as (rescuers) are able to go to those locations and determine whether people need services.”\n\nMore than 1.9M Floridians without power\n\nMore than 1.9 million homes and businesses across Florida were without power Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of the homes and businesses in 12 counties were without power, although authorities said they were making progress in restoring electricity.\n\nDeSantis said the power grids in Lee and Charlotte counties will likely have to be rebuilt.\n\n\"Lee and Charlotte are basically off the grid at this point,\" DeSantis said. \"That's going to be more than just connecting a power line back to a pole.\"\n\nHospital roof partially torn off, fire station flooded: Damage in Florida\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast saw major damage as Hurricane Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire-Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water. In Cape Coral, about 30 miles up the coast, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nNearby Fort Myers saw intense storm surge flooding coastal communities and the area around WINK News, a local CBS affiliate. Videos showed water reaching car windshields in the studio's parking lot and some of the storm surge leaking into the building.\n\nFarther north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.

Click here for the latest updates and info tracking Hurricane Ian's path toward Florida on Tuesday, Sept. 27.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Cuba early Tuesday after it strengthened to a Category 3 storm with 125 mph winds. The storm was forecast to strengthen further over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before reaching Florida as early as Wednesday as a Category 4 storm with top winds of 140 mph.\n\nThe storm made landfall in Cuba’s Pinar del Rio province, where officials set up 55 shelters, rushed in emergency personnel and took steps to protect crops in Cuba’s main tobacco-growing region.\n\n“Cuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life-threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,” hurricane center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press.\n\nThe strengthening storm prompted a swath of hurricane and storm surge warnings in Florida and the first evacuations along the state's west coast.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Ian was about 500 miles wide and more evacuations are expected as Ian draws closer to his state. Hurricane-force winds extend up to 35 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 115 miles, the hurricane center said Monday.\n\n“Floridians up and down the Gulf Coast should feel the impacts of this,\" DeSantis said Monday at the state Emergency Operations Center. “This is a really, really big hurricane at this point.”\n\nThe storm was about 105 miles southeast of western Cuba as of 11 p.m. Monday, moving north-northwest at 13 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, making it a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nTampa Bay was placed under a hurricane warning as of 5 p.m. ET. A storm surge warning was also in effect for much of the southwest Florida coast.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\nIan was forecast to intensify rapidly into a major hurricane, Category 3 or greater, as soon as late Monday, AccuWeather said. The storm could ultimately reach Category 4 status, which means sustained winds from 130 mph to 156 mph.\n\nRAPID INTENSIFICATION: What does that mean?\n\nWhere is Ian headed?\n\nIan was forecast to emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, pass west of the Florida Keys late Tuesday, and approach the west coast of Florida on Wednesday into Thursday. The storm is predicted to slow during this period, the National Hurricane Center warned in an advisory.\n\n\"This would likely prolong the storm surge, wind and rainfall impacts along the affected portions of the west coast of Florida,\" the advisory says, adding that \"the roughly shore-parallel track still makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what locations will experience the most severe impacts.\"\n\n'CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE?: Florida Gov. DeSantis declares state of emergency: What we know\n\nTampa Bay prepares for Ian\n\nTampa mayor Jane Castor said she and local officials in her region fear “a near worst case scenario” following the latest report by the National Hurricane Center that predicts Ian may bring a storm surge of as much as 10 feet.\n\n“We could handle the wind if it came through quickly, but … we are already saturated in the Tampa Bay area,” Castor told CNN. “And we have a unique situation geographically with the bay being very shallow.”\n\n“It’s a near worst-case scenario for our area,” she said.\n\nHillsborough County ordered a mandatory evacuation of residents living in coastal areas, and those in trailer and manufactured homes, at 2 p.m. Monday, a decision impacting an estimated 300,000 residents.\n\nTampa Bay International Airport and the Port of Tampa Bay will suspend operations Tuesday, according to DeSantis. St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport also plans to suspend operations Tuesday. Other airports in the state will monitor Ian but have not announced closures.\n\nCuba could see 14 feet of storm surge\n\nAuthorities in Cuba were evacuating 50,000 people Monday in Pinar del Rio province after announcing plans to evacuate 20 communities \"in the shortest time possible,\" according to state media. Officials also suspended classes, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses.\n\nForecasters predicted areas of Cuba’s western coast could see as much as 14 feet of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected by this evening,\" the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. \"Destructive winds are possible where the core of Ian moves across western Cuba.\"\n\nLandfall in Florida likely for midweek\n\nFlorida's north-central coast to nearly all of North Florida is inside the five-day Ian forecast cone. Landfall is increasingly likely in Florida midweek, AccuWeather said. Some evacuations were ordered Monday in coastal Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. The county suspended classes through Thursday to prepare schools to serve as shelters for evacuees.\n\n“Please treat this storm seriously. It’s the real deal. This is not a drill,” Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said Monday in Tampa.\n\nIan is expected to miss most of Cuba's high, mountainous terrain that often disrupts tropical systems, allowing the storm to become a Category 4 hurricane. What happens next will depend largely on the track Ian takes, according to AccuWeather. A southward dip in the jet stream across the United States will help pull the storm northward and into the coast.\n\n\"Just how quickly this interaction happens will determine the track of Ian, as well as how strong the system is when it reaches land,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?:It's often a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nMandatory evacuations begin as Florida prepares for storm\n\nDeSantis, who has issued a statewide state of emergency, said an additional 2,500 Florida National Guard members were being called into duty, bringing the total to 5,000. Two thousand more were being sent to Florida from nearby states. The state is working to load 360 trailers with more than 2 million meals and more than 1 million gallons of water to prepare for distribution. Urban Search and Rescue Teams are ready to mobilize where needed, DeSantis said.\n\n“There is going to be an interruption of power, so just plan on that,\" DeSantis said. “The impacts are going to be far and wide.\"\n\nWhat is 'rapid intensification?'\n\n\"Rapid intensification\" is a process in which a storm undergoes accelerated growth: The phenomenon is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph within 24 hours. Ian is predicted to fit this definition. The storm's winds were forecast to approach 140 mph by late Tuesday.\n\nRapid intensification occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an \"extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. That typically includes very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture. Out of the nine hurricanes with winds of 150 mph or greater that struck the U.S. mainland over 103 years, all but one saw the explosion of force and power known as rapid intensification.\n\nProperty insurance crucial ahead of Ian\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist urged DeSantis to provide emergency 90-day property insurance coverage for homeowners who were dropped by their “failing companies.” State regulators asked a judge last week to place property insurance company FedNat Insurance Co. in receivership, making it the sixth Florida property insurer declared insolvent this year amid widespread financial problems in the industry, the News Service of Florida reported.\n\nThose insolvencies have contributed to massive growth in the number of customers pouring into the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp., which was created as an insurer of last resort. Crist says average property insurance premiums have risen from under $2,000 when DeSantis took office in 2019 to more than $4,200.\n\nNASA rolling Artemis spacecraft back into building\n\nNASA will roll the Artemis I Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft back into a building Monday after data gathered overnight \"did not show improving expected conditions\" for the Kennedy Space Center area, NASA said. The decision allows time for employees to address the needs of their families while also protecting the integrated rocket and spacecraft system. The launch, scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed because of the storm. Putting the spacecraft back into the Vehicle Assembly Building probably will further delay the launch.\n\nArtemis is a first step toward establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon to prepare for missions to Mars.\n\nWHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE WIND SPEED SCALE?:Breaking down how we classify hurricanes.\n\nHow are theme parks handling Ian?\n\nAs Florida officials and residents watch the path of Hurricane Ian, theme parks in Central Florida are monitoring the weather and have cancellation policies in case of a hurricane or tropical storm.\n\nWalt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort say they are continuing operations but are ready for significant weather changes. Disney World will temporarily close some resort features Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"We have plans and procedures for significant weather that are both time-proven and constantly updated. Everything revolves around the safety of our guests and team members,\" Universal Orlando Resort spokesperson Alyson Sologaistoa told USA TODAY.\n\nBusch Gardens Tampa Bay will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nFlorida braces for Ian's fury\n\nThe National Weather Service on Monday issued a hurricane watch along the west coast of Florida from north of Englewood to the Anclote River, including Tampa Bay. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide state of emergency, urging residents to load up on food, water, medicine, batteries and fuel. He said it was too soon to determine when or where Ian will make landfall, but that evacuations may be ordered in coming days.\n\nBethune-Cookman University canceled classes Monday at its campus in Daytona Beach and said it would reconvene remotely on Tuesday.\n\n\"Expect heavy rains, strong winds, flash flooding, storm surge and even isolated tornadoes. Make preparations now,\" DeSantis said Sunday. \"Anticipate power outages. That is something that is likely to happen with a hurricane of this magnitude.\"\n\nSTILL NO WATER OR ELECTRICITY: Voices from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona\n\nCategory 4 storms can cause 'catastrophic' damage\n\nIf the storm struck as a Category 4 hurricane, it could cause \"catastrophic\" damage, and power outages could last weeks or months, according to the National Weather Service's description of storms that strong. Areas can be uninhabitable for weeks or months, the weather service says.\n\n“Even if you’re not necessarily right in the eye of the path of the storm, there’s going to be pretty broad impacts throughout the state,\" DeSantis warned.\n\nStorm could drive heavy rains all week\n\nHeavy rainfall is expected to affect North Florida, eastern portions of the Florida Panhandle, and portions of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions into the weekend. Parts of west-central Florida will see the most: 8 to 10 inches across much of the area. Some parts could see up to 15 inches.\n\n\"Considerable flooding impacts are possible mid- to late week in central Florida given already saturated antecedent conditions,\" the weather service warned. \"Flash and urban flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida peninsula through midweek.\"\n\nLimited flood impacts and rises on area streams and rivers are possible over northern Florida and portions of the Southeast mid- to late week.\n\nFLORIDA'S EAST COAST NOT IN CLEAR:Hurricane threat from Ian prompts preparations for flooding, power outages in Brevard\n\nFlorida's west coast could take rare hurricane hit\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists are warning that the storm could slam the west coast of Florida – an often-missed target. The U.S. database shows that about 160 hurricanes, excluding tropical storms, have affected Florida. Only 17 have made landfall on the west coast north of the Florida Keys.\n\nMost storms typically travel northeast or northwest, not up the coast, AccuWeather senior weather editor Jesse Ferrell said. There is no record of a hurricane ever having tracked entirely up the west coast of Florida since records began in 1944. But Ian appears likely to take a \"very unusual track,\" he said.\n\nFlorida has been the target of recent storms that were hurricanes but were downgraded to tropical storms before landfall, Ferrell said. Elsa in 2021 made landfall west of Tampa, and Eta in 2020 made landfall north of Tampa in Cedar Key. Neither had the firepower close to a Category 3 storm, however.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Sergio Bustos, Tallahassee Democrat; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/us/tropical-storm-ian-florida-hurricane-monday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian strengthens to Category 2 storm and could be ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Affected by the storm? Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth.\n\nCNN —\n\nHurricane Ian keeps getting stronger as it barrels toward Florida, prompting urgent evacuations and threatening dangerous storm surges in places not used to getting hit directly by a hurricane.\n\nIan is now a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, according to a 5 p.m. ET update from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. The eye of the storm is located around 150 miles southeast of the western tip of Cuba and Ian is moving north-northwest near 13 mph, the center said.\n\nFlorida could start feeling Ian’s wrath as early as Tuesday, with hurricane conditions potentially hitting the state Wednesday.\n\nThe hurricane center’s forecast for Ian “has shown an unprecedented rate of strengthening from a tropical storm to powerful hurricane,” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nIan’s winds intensified from 85 mph Monday afternoon to 100 mph at 5 p.m. ET. Forecasters expect Ian to become a major hurricane before it lashes the US, with winds reaching 111 mph or greater.\n\n#Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of\n\nMexico during the middle of this week. Regardless of Ian’s exact track, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, & heavy rainfall along the west coast/Panhandle of Florida by mid-week pic.twitter.com/koVmW9yrtJ — National Weather Service (@NWS) September 26, 2022\n\nConditions in western Cuba are expected to deteriorate this evening and through the night, with “significant wind and storm surge impacts expected,” the hurricane center said. Ian will likely be a Category 3 with winds of 120 mph or greater when it moves over Cuba Tuesday morning, forecasters say, and it’s also expected to produce flash flooding and possible mudslides in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.\n\nA total of 19,283 people have been evacuated from their homes in the Western Cuban province of Pinar del Río, according to the state news channel TelePinar.\n\n“Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area tonight and early Tuesday,” the center said.\n\nIn the US, more than 15 million people are expected to suffer at least tropical storm-force winds in cities including Tampa, Orlando, Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Miller said.\n\nA storm surge warning has been added for portions of western Florida with 5 to 10 feet of surge possible, according to the latest advisory. The warning of “life-threatening inundation” stretches from Anclote River southward to Flamingo and includes Tampa Bay.\n\nThe hurricane watch from Englewood to the Anclote River, including Tampa Bay, has been upgraded to a hurricane warning, according to the latest advisory from the hurricane center. This means “hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case, within 24 to 36 hours,” the center said.\n\nLive updates: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement Monday that tropical storm-force winds may begin as soon as Monday night in the Florida Keys and south Florida. “Storm surge has the potential to impact much of Florida’s west coast, with the highest risk from Ft. Myers to the Tampa Bay region,” the statement read.\n\n‘The storm of a lifetime’ for Tampa Bay\n\nWhile projection models show a wide range of possible paths, one fear is evident: The Tampa area, on the western side of Florida, could get its first direct hit from a hurricane since 1921. And that could be devastating.\n\n“The last major hurricane that actually made a direct hit was 100 years ago,” said meteorologist Rick Davis of the National Weather Service’s Tampa office. “So there’s a lot of people that have been brushed by hurricanes in the last five or 10 years in Florida.”\n\nDavis added: “We tell people even if they’re lifelong Floridians like myself, this is something that we haven’t seen in our lifetime… So we definitely need to take it seriously.”\n\nBut the area doesn’t need a direct hit to see catastrophic damage from flooding. Tampa Bay is extremely vulnerable to storm surge because water being pushed into it has nowhere to go.\n\nThe current forecast track for Hurricane Ian puts all of the Tampa Bay region – Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Bradenton and others – on the right side of the storm, which would see winds push water northward into the bay, maximizing the inundation from storm surge. The current storm surge forecast for this area is up to 10 feet.\n\nThe center of the storm tracks within 10 miles of the St. Petersburg coastline in Pinellas County, near Clearwater, while also slowing the storm down to a walking pace between 3 to 4 mph on Thursday as it makes its closest pass.\n\nThe combination of mammoth storm surges and a stubborn, slow-moving hurricane could be disastrous for Pinellas County, officials there said.\n\n“It could potentially sit on top of us for 47 hours,” said Cathie Perkins, Pinellas County emergency management director. Officials are expecting 10 to 15 inches of rain, Perkins said.\n\nJamie Rhome, the National Hurricane Center acting director, told CNN Monday that Ian “would be the storm of a lifetime for many Tampa Bay residents.”\n\n‘If you can leave, just leave now’\n\nFishermen prepare to move their boats in Havana, Cuba, on Monday before the arrival of Hurricane Ian. Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nOn Florida’s west coast, officials urged residents to flee instead of staying to protect their property.\n\n“This is nothing to mess around with. If you can leave, just leave now,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Monday. “You certainly could replace personal possessions. You can’t bring anyone back to life.”\n\nCastor said 49 shelters are open, including some accepting pets and others accommodating residents with special needs.\n\n“We’re not trying to instill fear,” Castor said. “We’re just asking everyone to be responsible, to be cognitive of what this storm can bring us.”\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued Monday for Zone A of Pinellas and Hillsborough counties. The Pinellas order goes into effect at 6 p.m. Monday, and the Hillsborough order went into effect at 2 p.m. Voluntary evacuation has been recommended for Zone B of Hillsborough, and emergency shelters are being opened, county administrator Bonnie Wise said Monday.\n\nEffective 6 p.m. today, all residents in Evacuation Zone A (including all mobile home residents) will be under mandatory evacuation orders. Mandatory orders for evacuation zones B and C will be effective tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/36ayoOEMIz — Pinellas County (@PinellasCoNews) September 26, 2022\n\nIn Pinellas, mandatory orders for Zones B and C will go into effect Tuesday morning, a tweet from the county read.\n\n“When we issued that mandatory evacuation, what that means is if you don’t and you call for help, we’re not coming because we’re not going to put our people in harm’s way and put them in peril because you didn’t listen to what we told you to do,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri.\n\nGualtieri added that officials would not be knocking on doors to evacuate people. “You need to do it and if you don’t do it, you’re on your own.

Several presidents have also descended on various states for a final midterm push. President Joe Biden is set to join a rally tonight in Maryland. Former President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis held dueling events in Florida on Sunday. On Saturday, Biden made a rare joint appearance with former President Barack Obama to boost Democratic candidate John Fetterman in the key state of Pennsylvania, while Trump also held a rally in the state. Voters will decide the fate of both chambers of Congress, with all 435 seats of the House up for grabs. Thirty-five of the 100 Senate seats are also on the line – in addition to dozens of governorships, secretaries of state and attorneys general. Find out how and when to vote in your state here.\n\n2. Storms\n\nMany Florida residents who are still recovering from Hurricane Ian are being asked to prepare for a possible tropical system later this week. Subtropical Storm Nicole has formed in the southwest Atlantic about 555 miles east of the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said, and could impact Florida on Election Day. Specifically, Tuesday’s current forecast calls for breezy to gusty conditions for much of the Florida Peninsula and rain chances will increase throughout the day for central and eastern cities. Weather forecast models are showing at least 3 to 6 inches of rainfall across the state through Thursday, with isolated higher amounts possible. Meanwhile, forecasts show a second system in the Atlantic may develop, but it will not impact land over the next several days.\n\n3. Ukraine\n\nAbout 4.5 million Ukrainians have been left without power today as Russia steps up its attacks on civilian infrastructure, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Households across the country have been disconnected from power under an emergency schedule aimed at stabilizing the nation’s fragile electric grid. Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure has been under severe strain since Russia began attacking power plants on October 10, ushering in fears of a cold, dark winter. The mayor of Kyiv has encouraged some residents to think about staying with family and friends outside of the main city if it is left without electricity or water. All possible action plans are being considered in the case of an emergency, but there are no current plans to evacuate the city, according to a statement from the Kyiv City Council.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ukraine's military find something they feared searching for missing soldiers 04:21 - Source: CNN\n\n4.

The company said in a statement that its assembly facility located in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou is “currently operating at significantly reduced capacity” due to Covid curbs. As a result, the company said it expects lower shipments of some iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated, which will cause longer wait times. It remains unclear how long the delays will be.

The Islamic Republic is facing one of the biggest shows of dissent ever following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who died after being detained by the morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly. The letter was signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, state media said.

It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.\n\n“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”\n\nThe job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.\n\nIn September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.\n\nMeta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.\n\nLast month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.\n\n“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”\n\nShares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nMeta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\n“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.\n\nMeta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.\n\nA handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff.

That dynamic only kicked into overdrive the past couple of years amid a pandemic-fueled boom for tech products and services.\n\n“The hiring … was off the charts, paying [salaries] that were probably too high or out of range, where companies would hire four or five people for a sales position when they really only needed two,” said Bill McHargue, founder of San Francisco-based recruitment firm Talent House.\n\nBut the situation has started to cool as the tech industry and the broader economy have been hit by the perfect storm of inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a recession and Russia’s war in Ukraine. A wave of tech companies that had been aggressively hiring, from Netflix (NFLX) to Coinbase, have announced layoffs in recent weeks. Many others are also moving to cut costs, with Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR) and Apple (AAPL) all planning to slow or pause hiring.\n\n“They’re not going to hire as many people, they’re going to do much more due diligence, that interview process is going to take a lot longer, the [compensation] is going to get a little bit softer,” said McHargue, whose firm mainly works with early-stage startups.\n\n“I think it’s back to some realistic numbers,” he added, describing the current reduction as returning to pre-pandemic levels. “I think the correction was going to happen, it had to happen, now we just don’t know how long it’s going to last.”\n\nFor some tech workers, that could mean whiplash — not just in how easily they can secure a high-paying job, but also in how much leverage they have with management in pushing for specific workplace conditions.\n\nExperienced senior engineers at major tech companies may still have an upper hand in the job market, but the downturn may serve up a reality check for tech employees used to getting what they want, whether it was office perks pre-pandemic or going up against their corporate overlords during the pandemic for the right to work however and wherever they wanted.\n\nDuring the tech boom of the past decade, “competition for employees created a Disney-esque set of experiences/expectations in high tech companies,” prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, an early investor in Uber, wrote in a recent Twitter thread. “For employees that have only known this world, the idea of layoffs or cost reduction (or being asked to come into the office) is straight up heresy,” he added.\n\nNow, billionaire CEOs of some of tech’s biggest companies are starting to adopt a sterner approach, implying that employees must either shape up or ship out — possibly with the intention of encouraging layoffs by attrition.\n\n“Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told employees in a Q&A session last week. “Part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might decide that this place isn’t for you, and that self-selection is OK with me.” Meta did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk also issued an ultimatum last month — weeks before announcing layoffs — that workers who don’t come to the office at least 40 hours a week should leave the company, in a sharp departure from the current policies of many tech companies, including Twitter, which he has agreed to acquire.\n\nReturning to the office is one of the most hot-button issues that tech employers and employees have clashed over. Amir Hamja/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut the growth in worker activism spurred by the pandemic and the willingness of employees to advocate for their interests — including their comfort level with being back in an office — may not be that easy to reverse overnight, according to Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of inclusion consultancy firm ReadySet.\n\n“The demand for tech and knowledge workers is still global, and there’s still a shortfall,” Hutchinson said. “So I think that workers that don’t want to go back into that environment aren’t going to.”\n\nIn fact, across the tech industry, the downturn may produce a more favorable outcome for tech employees fighting for the right to work remotely, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University whose research focuses on workplace management issues.\n\n“For some industries, like banking, a recession will give management more leverage to force employees back to the office. Tech seems to be going the other way,” said Bloom. “Right now most tech firms are giving employees roughly what they want, which is about two days a week in the office.”\n\nBut the move towards remote work could end up being a double-edged sword for many American tech employees, particularly in places like Silicon Valley, with the possibility of companies using it to cut costs further.\n\n“As we enter a recession tech firms will tighten belts by cutting back on office space and moving to hire cheaper workers outside big cities and abroad,” Bloom said, mentioning countries such as India and Mexico as destinations for outsourced jobs.\n\nHarley Lippman, CEO of technology staffing firm Genesis10, said one trend that he sees starting to emerge is a greater tendency to hire contractors rather than permanent employees because of the flexibility it provides companies. “Work still has to get done,” he said.\n\nWhatever form it ultimately takes, it’s clear that tech employees will have to brace for a significant course correction across their industry.\n\n“We saw candidates take offers and then not show up at the new company. Like, that happened,” said McHargue. “I don’t think we’re going to see that sort of thing.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/tech/tech-layoffs-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Silicon Valley's greatest minds misread pandemic demand ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn the early months of the pandemic, Facebook only grew bigger and more central to our lives. With lockdowns spreading, countless people began shopping, socializing and working on Facebook and other online platforms. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March 2020, usage was so high that the company was “just trying to keep the lights on.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Zuckerberg’s company went on a remarkable hiring spree. Facebook, which later rebranded as Meta, went from 48,268 staffers in March 2020 to more than 87,000 as of September of this year. In other words, it hired another Facebook’s worth of staff. And it looked like the company would only keep hiring to support its ambitious plans to build a future version of the internet called the metaverse.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Zuckerberg reversed course and laid off more than 11,000 employees, marking the most significant cuts in the company’s history. In a memo to staff, Zuckerberg coughed up some of the hardest words in the English language. “I got this wrong,” he wrote, “and I take responsibility for that.”\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\nThe Facebook logo reflected in a puddle at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSilicon Valley operates on many myths, but one of them is the idea of the founder as a visionary who can see key trends coming years if not decades out. But Zuckerberg is one of a growing list of prominent tech leaders who are cutting costs and issuing mea culpas after failing to anticipate a whiplash in the market between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe tech industry, already seemingly invincible in early 2020, only grew more dominant during the pandemic while other parts of the economy were upended. Consumers shifted spending online. The Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates at the time, giving tech companies easier access to capital. And private and public market valuations for tech companies only seemed to go higher.\n\nAs the world reopened, however, many consumers have returned to their offline lives. Meanwhile, high inflation and fears of a looming recession have cut into consumer and advertiser spending, disrupting the core businesses of many of the biggest names in tech, after years of rapid growth.\n\nNow the industry is cutting thousands of jobs.\n\nLast month, home fitness company Peleton — which had been embraced by investors during the pandemic — underwent its fourth round of layoffs in 2022. Last week, payment-processing giant Stripe said it was eliminating 14% of its staff. And Twitter recently announced widespread job cuts after its new owner Elon Musk bought the company for $44 billion, funded in part by debt financing.\n\nWhile Musk was largely silent regarding the mass layoffs, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who ran the company until late 2021, said in a contrite thread that he takes responsibility for the situation. “I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that,” Dorsey wrote.\n\nTwitter headquarters is seen on Friday, October 28, 2022 the day after Elon Musk aquired Twitter for $44 billion. Amy Osborne/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nPatrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, one of the most valuable startups in the world, similarly told employees that leadership takes responsibility for the pandemic-era miscalculations that resulted in people losing their livelihoods.\n\n“For those of you leaving: we’re very sorry to be taking this step and John and I are fully responsible for the decisions leading up to it,” Collison wrote. “We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown.”\n\nOther big tech companies, including Amazon, Apple and Google, are now pausing or slowing hiring amid recession fears after a wave of expansion. Amazon, in particular, had seen breakneck growth during the pandemic, doubling its fulfillment centers in a two-year-period, only to shift earlier this year to focusing on “cost efficiencies.”\n\nThe e-commerce giant is now freezing corporate hiring “for the next few months” and reportedly looking to cut costs in some of its unprofitable units. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said senior leadership regularly reviews investment outlook and financial performance, adding, “As part of this year’s review, we’re of course taking into account the current macro-environment and considering opportunities to optimize costs.”\n\n“Nobody is immune”\n\nWhile there have been layoffs in Silicon Valley over the years, the latest wave of cost cuts appears to be hitting every corner of the industry, including the engineers and coders who were often considered untouchable. The tech bubble may not have burst, but the bubble on top of the bubble certainly has.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta’s layoffs would be spread throughout the company, including impacting both its family of apps and the Reality Labs division that is tasked with helping build the metaverse. He noted that some teams — such as recruiting — will be affected more than others.\n\nWith Musk at the helm, Twitter slashed half its staff, including on its ethical AI, marketing and communication, search and public policy teams.\n\nRoger Lee, a startup founder based in San Francisco, has been closely tracking layoffs in the tech industry since the onset of the pandemic via his website Layoffs.fyi. Initially, his goal was to informally keep track of staffing reductions to help look for potential candidates to recruit for his own company, a digital 401(k) provider for small businesses. Eventually, laid-off workers began submitting their own data and compiling spreadsheets for his website to attract the attention of recruiters.\n\n“I did not, unfortunately, anticipate the extent to which the layoffs were going to surge,” Lee told CNN Business. With nearly two months still left to go, he said the number of tech employees laid off in 2022 has already surpassed 100,000 based on his data.\n\nLee said some of the biggest trends he’s been seeing recently are major job losses across recruiting, human resources, and sales teams. While “engineers are still in better shape relative to the other roles,” Lee said his data indicate even these positions have suffered cuts in recent months.\n\n“No one knows how long this current period is going to last,” he said.\n\nAlready, there’s been a clear shift in the industry’s mood. Blind, a popular online forum that lets employees at major companies commune anonymously to share interview tips and brag about compensation packages, has emerged as a sobering forum where people are posting about layoffs rather then their jobs.\n\nSome laid-off workers are also banding together on social media and crowdsourcing spreadsheets for recruiters. These workers have created documents featuring hundreds of names and LinkedIn profiles (as well as visa statuses) of former Twitter and Meta workers.\n\nWhile some companies may be better equipped to weather the storm than others, it’s becoming apparent that no company is completely unaffected, said Nikolai Roussanov, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Tech has been clobbered so much precisely because it has been seen as very immune to fluctuations in the real economy, but in the end, nobody is immune,” Roussanov said. “And that realization, I think, is important and perhaps what contributed to these sky-high valuations coming down pretty quickly.”\n\nMeta’s market cap has fallen from a peak of more than $1 trillion last year to less than $300 billion. Amazon, meanwhile, has seen its market cap drop by $1 trillion from a peak last summer.\n\nRoussanov said current fears of a recession are not unwarranted, but in many ways, “there is a little bit of a self-fulfilling nature to this.” He added: “As these fears become more and more widespread, they slow down people’s consumption, they slow down firm investment, and that kind of snowballs on itself.”\n\nWhat’s going on in tech right now is “perhaps a taste of what’s yet to come” elsewhere, Roussanov said.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/us/five-things-november-9-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for November 9: Midterms, Abortion, Inflation ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Midterms\n\nThe fight for control of Congress – both the House of Representatives and the Senate – still hangs in the balance as results continue to trickle in from crucial midterm contests. It’s too early to call key races – including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona – that could determine which party controls the chambers. But in closely-watched Pennsylvania, Democrat John Fetterman will win the state’s Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pickup is a big boost to Democrats’ hopes of clinging to the Senate. Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority, one that favored Republicans, remains unsettled as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize.\n\n2. Abortion\n\nVoters in three states moved to protect abortion rights on Tuesday after a monthslong push from Democrats nationwide to act on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. While CNN has projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in Michigan, California and Vermont passed initiatives that will protect the right to the procedure. Some measures are still too early to call, including an amendment to Kentucky’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion. Meanwhile, voters in Montana considered a ballot referendum that would impose criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion.\n\n3. Inflation\n\nHigh prices for food, gas and other essentials were at the top of mind for voters as they cast ballots in this year’s midterms, according to preliminary results of national and state exit polls. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation – which has hovered around 40-year highs – has caused them severe or moderate hardship. The exit poll results, conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research, are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy. Roughly half of voters also said they approve President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness effort, while nearly the same disapprove.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\n4.

The National Hurricane Center predicts the coastal area will receive up to 8 inches of rain and storm surge that could rise to 5 feet.

The move is one of several shifts the Facebook parent company is making following a period of slower-than-usual growth.\n\n“We regularly re-evaluate our talent pipeline according to our business needs and in light of the expense guidance given for this earnings period, we are slowing its growth accordingly,” said a statement provided by Meta spokesperson Andrea Beasley. The company still plans to “grow our workforce to ensure we focus on long term impact,” the statement said.\n\nThe company does not currently have plans for layoffs, but the hiring slowdown marks a reversal from aggressive workforce growth during the first three months of 2022. As of March 31, the company’s headcount was 77,805, up 28% year-over-year with 5,800 net new employee adds during the first quarter. Meta plans to slow or halt hiring for most mid- to senior-level positions, and recently also paused hiring early-career engineers. Business Insider first reported Meta’s plan to slow hiring.\n\nMeta shares fell nearly 7% Thursday.\n\nThe announcement comes a week after Meta posted its slowest revenue growth in years during the first three months of 2022, and profits down 21% from the same period in the prior year. It is projecting revenues from the current quarter to be between $28 billion to $30 billion, which would be nearly flat compared to the $29 billion it brought in during the prior-year quarter.\n\nMeta is in the midst of attempting to shift its strategy to focus on its plans for an augmented and virtual-reality-enabled future. The company is also facing steep competition from rivals like TikTok, lost business in Russia, difficulties monetizing crucial video content and challenges to its advertising business from privacy changes by Apple. Meta reported last week that its average price-per-ad decreased 8% year-over-year during the first quarter.\n\nAlthough the company last week lowered its estimate for its full-year expenses by about $3 billion, Zuckerberg warned investors that Meta planned to slow the pace of some investments because of its current challenging growth prospects.\n\n“After the start of Covid, the acceleration of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth, but we’re now seeing that trend back off,” Zuckerberg said on an earnings call with analysts. “Based on the strong revenue growth we saw in 2021, we kicked off a number of multi-year projects to accelerate some of our longer-term investments … but with our current business growth levels, we are now planning to slow the pace of some of our investments.”\n\nOn the call, Zuckerberg discussed how the company would be focusing on several key areas of investment, such as short-form video and the immersive, future form of the internet the company calls the “metaverse.”\n\n“We’re shifting the bulk of the energy inside the company toward those high priority areas,” he said. “We have a lot of awesome people here and a lot of the decisions we get to make on a day-to-day basis are: how do we direct the really talented people that are already at the company … rather than always relying on just getting more and more new people from the outside.”\n\nZuckerberg also said Meta hopes in the coming years to generate sufficient operating income growth from its family of apps to fund its investments in Reality Labs while still growing the company’s overall profitability, but warned about short-term challenges.\n\n“Of course, our priority remains building for the long-term, so while we’re currently building our plans to achieve this, it is possible that prolonged macroeconomic or business uncertainty could force us to trade off against shorter-term financial goals,” Zuckerberg said. “But we remain confident in our long-term opportunities.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Are tech stocks getting burned again? | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

But this year, the biggest tech companies aren’t in celebration mode.\n\nWhat’s happening: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sagged last week, bursting the balloons of investors who had hoped that the sector was finally buzzing back to life after suffering its worst first half in decades.\n\nLast month, the Nasdaq staged a huge comeback that ran into August. The index marked its longest weekly winning streak since November and entered a new bull market.\n\nThe jump followed some positive inflation data released earlier this month that boosted investor sentiment and brought relief to the stock market. The consumer price index grew 8.5% year-over-year in July, down from 9.1% in June. This spurred hopes that the Federal Reserve would take a less aggressive approach to future rate hikes.\n\nIt’s looking like the central bank won’t be as dovish as investors would like.\n\n“Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said from the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium on Friday.\n\nTracking the fallout: The comments sent markets tumbling. The Dow lost more than 1,000 points, or 3%, and the Nasdaq finished 3.9% lower.\n\nBecause the tech sector is so forward-facing, it’s particularly sensitive to interest rate changes and inflation. When rates go down, tech company valuations grow and become frothier, since riskier investments look more attractive. When interest rates increase, it’s harder to court investors.\n\nEven with its recent return to bull territory, the Nasdaq has fallen by about 23% year-to-date, and there are worries that the prolonged hit could take a toll on business. Enterprise tech spending is starting to deteriorate, and consumer-oriented hardware products are seeing sales and prices weaken.\n\nTech companies are also starting to shed workers. About 40,000 workers in the US tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2022.\n\nCompanies reliant on consumer spending and ad revenue — think names like Amazon, Facebook and Twitter — may be in trouble. But it’s not all bad news, according to Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nHe sees companies like Cisco and Microsoft that deal in software, hardware and semiconductors as worth buying.\n\n“It’s a secular theme for us,” he said. “Developments in automation and the internet of things give these companies a long shelf life.”\n\nThe tricky part is that the “discretionary earnings shoe has yet to drop for tech,” he said. Consumers could pull back spending as inflation continues to bite. Buyer beware.\n\nDon’t dismiss Amazon’s health care push just yet\n\nThe US health care sector has long been a golden goose for tech companies. It’s slow to adapt to new technology, largely inefficient and most importantly, it’s massive. The US telemedicine market size alone is expected to top $81 billion this year, according to research by Deloitte and Vodafone.\n\nBut Big Tech just can’t seem to crack it. Last year Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, called Amazon Care one of the most exciting innovations at the company. Last week, he abruptly announced that the company would shutter its telehealth service.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Amazon (AMZN) has swung and missed in this arena. It previously partnered with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create a health care company for its own employees from scratch. That fell apart in 2021.\n\nApple (AAPL) also attempted to create a medical clinic for its employees, branded AC wellness, but it had to curtail some of its ambitions after Apple (AAPL) employees raised concerns about health data collection.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL) unwound its health division, which housed a number of projects, last summer after facing criticism for a lack of direction.\n\n“Health care has been very slow to embrace and adopt technology,” said John Porter, chief investment officer of Newton Investment Management. “All of the big tech firms have looked at health care as an area they can get into and make better. But then they see how complicated it is. There are privacy issues, and an insanely convoluted payment system.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean this is the end. Amazon is still heavily invested in PillPack, a digital pharmacy service, and One Medical, a primary care chain.\n\nFalse starts have been frequent, but tech is just beginning to dip its toe into the health sector, said Porter. And he has a word of advice for the industry: Stick to what you know.\n\n“Everyone has some sort of health tracker on their wrist,” he said. “That’s the Trojan horse for tech to get into the business.”\n\nBy allowing consumers to track their own health data and report it to doctors if they wish, tech companies don’t have to deal with the myriad legal and regulatory issues surrounding the healthcare industry, he added.\n\nEither way, trial and error is what tech companies should be focused on right now.\n\n“They can pull back and try another approach to the market, which is what you’re seeing with Amazon,” he said. “This is a bit of a retrenchment, but this is a massive money opportunity.” Big Tech isn’t going anywhere.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is not a morning person\n\nThere was a lot of news last week, so you might have decided to skip Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s three-hour interview with Spotify podcast host Joe Rogan. Here are some of the highlights from their conversation.\n\nZuckerberg addressed criticism of his recent AI launches. New chatbots have exhibited offensive speech patterns , and his virtual reality system has been critiqued as rudimentary. There’s never going to be a perfect artificial intelligence system, he said.\n\nMeta’s next VR headset will contain new features to create a feeling of “social presence,” he said. “There’s more nonverbal communication when people are with each other than verbal communication.”\n\nZuckerberg addressed his company’s decision to reduce the spread of a New York Post article published in October of 2020 that made allegations about Hunter Biden. Zuckerberg said the article’s distribution was reduced for several days while it was reviewed by the company’s fact-checking partners.\n\nZuckerberg discussed the pandemic-era shift to working from home, saying it was a good thing for his engineers. “Sometimes it’s actually better to not be in the office because then people aren’t bugging you. You kind of want like a block of like five hours where you can just work on a problem,” he said.\n\nMarriage is tough, even for billionaires. Zuckerberg said his wife, Priscilla Chan, often breaks his focus when he’s working from home. “I’ll be like in zone, kind of flow concentration, working on something and you know, my wife will like ask me some, some like basic question, and I’ll just be like, ‘Oh man,’ it’s like, ‘I just like lost my flow,’” he said.\n\nZuck has rough mornings. “It’s almost like every day you wake up and you’re punched in the stomach,” he said. “I wake up in the morning, look at my phone, get like a million messages. It’s usually not good. People reserve the good stuff to tell me in person.”\n\nUp next\n\nPinduoduo (PDD) reports results before US markets open.\n\nComing tomorrow: Data on US consumer confidence and US job openings.

Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\nThe winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.\n\nAnd while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.\n\nThe jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.\n\nIn fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”\n\nThe winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”\n\nThe ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.\n\nJoseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check. CNN/CNN\n\nChahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.\n\n“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.\n\nThe announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”\n\nThe association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.\n\n“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”\n\nAll 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.\n\n“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.\n\nAccording to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.\n\nPowerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.\n\nPowerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.\n\nThe odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.\n\nPrior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/08/powerball-jackpot-winning-numbers-announced/8300286001/", "title": "Powerball winner: $2.04B jackpot ticket sold in Altadena, California", "text": "At Joe's Service Center in Altadena, California, it was worth the wait.\n\nA single ticket sold at the Los Angeles-area convenience store won the record-breaking $2.04 billion Powerball drawing Tuesday – a historic drawing for a jumbo jackpot that was delayed for almost 10 hours, testing the patience of lottery lovers everywhere.\n\n\"We want to thank all of our community members that always come that are dedicated to this station,\" said owner Joe Chahayed Jr. at a Tuesday press conference. \"They truly believe in luck and they truly believe that some things are just deserved to be.\"\n\nThe winning numbers were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10.\n\nNo winner has come forward yet, but the service center basked in the $1 million bonus for selling the golden ticket.\n\nThe largest lottery prize ever climbed to $2.04 billion on Tuesday morning, and the lump sum for the jackpot was at $997.6 million. In addition to the jackpot-winning ticket, 22 tickets worth $1 million that matched all five numbers except the Powerball were sold in 16 states, Powerball officials said.\n\nMonday's highly anticipated drawing was delayed because a participating lottery was still processing its sales and play data, the Multi-State Lottery Association said. As soon as the required procedures were completed by the one outstanding lottery, the drawing proceeded just before 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe delay was likely because of a two-part verification system of ticket sales that uses an outside vendor to ensure all is in order before the game’s numbers are drawn, said Terry Rich, a former director of the Iowa Lottery who also served on the Powerball board.\n\nWhere was the winning Powerball ticket sold?

Players can either select five white ball numbers from 1-69 and one red \"Powerball\" number from 1-26 or choose to do a \"quick pick\" which randomly selects numbers for them, according to Powerball.\n\nFor an extra $1, you can opt into “Powerplay,” which multiplies non-jackpot winning prizes by a factor of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10.\n\nWhat are the Powerball prizes?\n\nYou only need one matching number to win a prize.

Mesaros added that there are exceptions to the disclosure, such as personal safety concerns or confidential information.\n\nWashington’s Lottery also has similar policies, Kristi Weeks, the director of legal services of the state’s lottery, said. If Washington’s Lottery receives a public records request, it has to provide the name and city or town of residence of the winner.\n\n“The public policy of this state – that state agencies work for the public and the public is entitled to know how we do our work,” Weeks said. “So exemptions from public records laws have to be clear and explicitly stated.

Lawmakers have cited safety and privacy concerns for lottery winners who have their personal information released.\n\nStates that grant anonymity each have their own limitations or restrictions, including prize thresholds or a limited time period where a person can remain anonymous.\n\nSome states have laws that allow lottery prize winners to remain anonymous. Texas passed the Anonymity Bill, HB 59, on Sept. 1, 2017, according to Lauren Callahan, director of media relations of the Texas Lottery Commission.\n\n“The law allows prize winners of $1 million or more to choose to remain anonymous and prohibit all personally identifiable information from being released to the public,” Callahan said. “The anonymity issue only applies to prize winners of $1 million or more who have submitted their tickets after Jan. 1, 2018.”\n\nHere is a list of states that grant anonymity:\n\nArizona Delaware Florida Georgia Illinois Kansas Maryland Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana New Jersey North Dakota Ohio South Carolina Texas Virginia West Virginia Wyoming\n\nPrevious lottery winners\n\nStories of lucky and unlucky winners have been a subject people have been interested in for years – with unlucky stories dubbed as the “Curse of the Lottery.” In 2009, E!

However, soon after Wanczyk's $758.7 million win, a stroke of bad luck befell the lottery winner's name via social media.\n\nAccording to a July 2021 story on ABC27.com, after Wanczyk won, \"several fake social media accounts popped up using her name claiming she was giving away money in exchange for personal information.\"\n\nNew text messages then circulated four years later, claiming Wanczyk was donating $5,000 to 200 random individuals who were selected after a \"spin ball,\" according to ABC27. The text messages also instructed recipients to text a number to receive their money.\n\nThis was a scam, and experts say people should never give out their personal information via text message or email to strangers.

Becker said the California State Lottery has a “rigorous vetting process” to ensure that the person who says they’ve won is a legitimate winner.\n\nThe vetting process can take weeks or months before a winner can be declared, according to Becker.\n\nPOWERBALL JACKPOT 101:Here's what to do if you win\n\nSteve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, also advised lottery winners to immediately work with tax and financial experts to form a plan – including which payout to choose.\n\nThe plan also should include a \"fall guy,\" Azoury said. \"That’s the person or adviser who keeps you from giving loans to anybody, who tells people all the money’s tied up in investments, not available.

Thank Fed Chairman ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOne of the reasons for the record $2.04 billion jackpot for the Powerball drawing, which was announced Tuesday morning, is something you wouldn’t expect — the recent run of steep interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat’s because the size of the advertised $2.04 billion top prize is the amount winners would get, which involves taking 30 equal payments spread out over the next 29 years. Those payments come from an annuity purchased by the lottery sponsors, and the payments factor in an average rate of return. On Tuesday, Powerball adjusted the total jackpot from $1.9 billion to $2.04 billion.\n\nBut the thing is, the real prize is far more likely to be a much smaller lump sum, the “cash value” – which was $929.1 million prior to Powerball’s update – that never gets any attention.\n\n“All anyone ever talks about is the annuity prize,” said Victor Matheson, professor of economics and accounting at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. “It’s the number the lotteries market. It’s the number in the news story. But it’s the number that almost no one ever takes.”\n\nNo Powerball winner since 2014 has chosen the “larger” annuity amount over the cash prize.\n\nThe cash value is the amount the prize would actually cost the lottery, either in a lump-sum payment now, or to buy an annuity to make those 29 subsequent payments. The current environment of rising interest rates has opened the door to ever-larger annuity payments.\n\nIn the low interest rate environment of recent years, the advertised annuity price was only about 50% or 60% bigger than the cash value, or sometimes less.\n\nThe largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016 when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.\n\nThat advertised then-record annuity prize was 61% greater than the cash prize. Prior to the revised jackpot, the estimated annuity prize was 104% greater than the cash prize. If it was the same ratio as in 2016, that annuity prize would be only $1.5 billion.\n\nAnd if interest rates were as low as they were in January of this year, that annuity rate would be only $130 million.\n\nThe current prize assumes a return on the cash value of about 5.75% a year, Matheson said.\n\nBut even a conservative investor in stocks could likely do better by taking the money up front and investing it, not withstanding the swings in the stock market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 has risen 728% in the 29 years since October 1993, or a compounded annual average growth rate of about 7.5%.\n\nThe larger assumed return associated with Monday’s jackpot’s annuity prize might make it more attractive to the next big winner or winners, said Matheson.\n\nThen again, a disinclination to accept deferred gratification could overcome any investment assumptions or tax planning that goes into the winner’s calculations.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/us/five-things-november-11-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Nov. 11: Midterms, Student loans, Storm ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

In the race for the Senate, election officials say it may take hours – or days – to count the more than 500,000 votes remaining in Arizona and about 95,000 others in Nevada. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the Senate majority. Meanwhile, there are many key races that have yet to be called that will determine the future of the House in January. Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a narrow victory, but incoming results from California and Colorado could ultimately determine which party controls the chamber.\n\n2. Student loans\n\nA federal judge has struck down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declaring it illegal. Biden’s program was already on hold due to a separate legal challenge, but a new lawsuit filed by a conservative group will delay student loan relief even further. On Thursday, a Texas federal judge – who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump – found that the executive branch does not have clear congressional authorization to create the student loan forgiveness program. The Biden administration is appealing the decision. As for the 26 million borrowers who already provided their necessary details to be considered for debt forgiveness, the Department of Education “will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\n3.

Grocery prices\n\nAmericans grappling with high inflation are finally getting some relief at the grocery store. Prices overall have surged 12.4% through October versus a year ago, but analysts at the market research firm NielsenIQ say there are some deals to be had. In fresh produce, the average price for prepared mixed vegetables dropped 68% versus the same period last year. A lot of fresh seafood options are cheaper as well: striped bass fell 41.8% over the prior year while the cost of lobster is also down 7.2%. Some packaged baked goods such as assorted bagels fell 48%. Bakery sweet goods and cranberry sauce are also seeing declining prices just in time for the holidays. And in beverages, kombucha drinks have dropped 22.7%. Most consumers are also not buying in bulk, analysts say, as more shoppers are opting for smaller sizes to control their spending.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Grocery chain CEO on food prices: 'My crystal ball is broken' 02:07 - Source: CNN Business\n\n5. Climate\n\nPresident Biden is heading to a UN summit today where he is expected to tout his climate record. In a speech to the COP27 summit in Egypt, Biden will proclaim the US is back as a global leader on climate change following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included around $370 billion in clean energy incentives meant to slash the use of harmful greenhouse gases. However, many nations attending this week’s conference are focused on another matter: demanding climate reparations be paid by wealthy and high-emitting countries like the US to smaller, poorer nations that have felt the outsized effects of climate change. Biden has struggled to gain backing in Congress for global climate resilience funding, which would help low-income nations. And if Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the prospects of any new climate legislation over the next two years appears dim.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback John Kerry: Climate should not be about conflict with China 02:48 - Source: CNN\n\nTHIS JUST IN\n\nRussian troops leave Ukraine’s Kherson region\n\nRussian forces have completed their withdrawal from Ukraine’s Kherson region west of the Dnipro River, including the city of Kherson, Russia’s Defense Ministry said today.

Notification is given via official mail and normally takes up to two weeks to be received.”\n\nRussian penal colonies are known for their lack of hygiene and access to medical care, with inmates often required to perform manual labor.\n\nLast month, Griner lost her appeal of her sentence. She was detained in February and convicted in August of smuggling drugs into Russia.\n\nShe has repeatedly apologized for bringing a small amount of cannabis into the country, where she played basketball in the off-season.\n\nIn a statement, Griner’s representatives said they don’t know where she is – or what her condition is.\n\n“Our primary concern continues to be BG’s health and well-being,” Griner’s agent, Lindsay Colas, said. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where BG is or how she is doing, we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.”\n\nUS diplomatic efforts\n\nRussia “unfortunately followed past practice” and did not notify the United States ahead of moving Griner, a senior State Department official said Wedneday. While US officials expected Griner would be transferred, they found out about the move from her legal team and press reports.\n\nUS diplomats have asked Russia for information on Griner but Russia hasn’t provided any answers, the official said.\n\n“We are communicating very clearly to the Russians requesting information on her current location as well as her destination in addition to the message that we expect consistent with their obligations, including under under the Vienna Convention, to have a consistent consular access to Brittney Griner,” the official said.\n\nGriner’s detention has raised concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nThe US government condemned the denial of her appeal last week, with a State Department spokesperson calling it “another repudiation of justice, which only compounds the original injustice of her detention.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called news of Griner’s transfer “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.”\n\n“As we work to secure Brittney Griner’s release, we expect Russian authorities to provide our Embassy officials with regular access to all U.S. citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney, as is their obligation,” Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. “Ensuring the health and welfare of U.S. citizen detainees in Russia is a priority, and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for them all.”\n\nBiden says he is ‘determined’ to bring Griner home\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday he hopes Russia will talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange following Tuesday’s midterm elections.\n\n“My intention is to get her home, and we have had a number of discussions so far. And I am hopeful that now that our election is over, there’s a willingness to negotiate more specifically with this,” Biden said at a news conference.\n\n“I’m telling you, I am determined to get her home and get her home safely, along with others, I might add,” Biden said.\n\nAmerican officials “continue to work relentlessly to bring home” both Griner and Paul Whelan, another American held in Russia, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was convicted of espionage – charges he denies.\n\n“We will not relent until they are reunited with their loved ones,” Blinken said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abphillip Rhea Mogul", "Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/europe/brittney-griner-appeal-hearing/index.html", "title": "Russian court upholds Brittney Griner's drug smuggling conviction ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA judge in Russia has left Brittney Griner’s verdict in place, upholding on Tuesday the US basketball star’s conviction on drug smuggling charges and reducing only slightly her nine-year prison sentence.\n\nGriner’s sentence will be modified to count the time she spent in pretrial detention after her February 17 arrest at a Moscow airport, the judge ruled, with each day in pretrial custody counting as 1.5 days toward her prison sentence. It was not immediately clear exactly how much that would reduce the sentence.\n\nThe decision came after an appeal hearing Tuesday at which Griner, whom the US considers wrongfully detained, again apologized as she and her attorneys asked the court for a more lenient sentence, arguing the verdict was unfair and unjustified under Russian law. The attorneys urged the court to acquit her, calling her sentence disproportionate and the previous court ruling wrong in saying Griner had criminal intent.\n\n“I’ve been here almost eight months, and people with more severe crimes have been given less than what I was given,” Griner said Tuesday, appearing at the hearing via video link from her detention center, Correctional Colony No. 1 in Novoye Grishino, north of Moscow.\n\n“I really hope the court will adjust this sentence,” she said before the judgment, “because it has been very, very stressful and very traumatic to my mental and my psyche and being away from my family, not being able to communicate.”\n\nGriner’s attorneys expressed disappointment after the hearing, saying in a statement the verdict “contains numerous defects” and they feel “the punishment is excessive.”\n\nUS officials have tried to secure the release of Griner and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia, by proposing a prisoner swap with Russia. Those efforts have continued in recent weeks, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday in a statement that called the latest hearing a “sham,” adding, “President Biden has been very clear that Brittney should be released immediately.”\n\nAt a Covid-19 vaccination event, the President said: “We have not been meeting with much positive response but we’re not stopping.”\n\nThe Biden administration has had conversations with Russia on the matter in recent days, State Department spokesman Ned Price said on CNN. “This has not been a static process, we are continuing to urge them to engage and engage them seriously on this,” he said.\n\nBrittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony in August for drug smuggling, is seen on a screen Tuesday via a video link before a court hearing to consider an appeal against her sentence at a Moscow court.

That has not changed, the most senior American diplomat in Moscow told reporters Tuesday outside the Moscow Regional Court.\n\n“Nothing in the previous sentence, nothing in the result of today’s appeal changes the fact that the United States government considers Griner to be wrongfully detained,” US Embassy Charge d’Affaires Elizabeth Rood said.\n\nGriner was initially taken into custody days before the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – when authorities accused her of trying to smuggle less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner plays in Russia during the WNBA’s offseason.\n\nFollow live updates: Russia’s war in Ukraine\n\nThe All-Star center for the Phoenix Mercury pleaded guilty to drug charges, telling the court during her trial that vape cartridges containing the cannabis oil were in her luggage because she had packed her bags in a hurry.\n\nIn court Tuesday, defense attorney Maria Blagovolina cast doubt on the Russian examination of Griner’s alleged drug use, calling the results of that examination “doubtful and unconfirmed.” “Continuous narcotic substance use is incompatible with a career as a professional athlete,” added Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm.\n\n“No lawyer will be able to say in all honesty that this verdict is in line with Russian judicial practice,” Griner’s other attorney, Alexander Boykov of the Moscow Legal Center, said.\n\nBoth attorneys previously indicated they felt Griner’s nine-year sentence was extreme, with Blagovolina calling it “very severe for this type of crime and this amount of this substance.”\n\nAhead of the hearing, Blagovolina and Boykov called Griner a “strong person” with a “champion’s character” who was nevertheless “severely stressed being separated from her loved ones for over eight months.”\n\nThe court hearing the appeal could have left Griner’s verdict in place, overruled it and sent it back to the lower court, or reduced her prison term, her lawyers said.\n\n“She is very nervous waiting for the appeal hearing,” they added in a written statement to CNN. “Brittney does not expect any miracles to happen but hopes that the appeal court will hear the arguments of the defense and reduce the term.”\n\nBlagovolina told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that the next step would be a second appeal, “but normally we do not expect much from this legal step.”\n\nThe lawyer said the basketball star is a “fighter” and has been holding up well, but she was visibly upset with Tuesday’s decision.\n\n“Of course she didn’t expect much from today’s hearing, but still she did have some hope, in a way you could see from her face that she was very, very upset when the court hearing ended,” Blagovolina said.\n\nBlagovolina said that it’s still early to discuss what conditions Griner might face while incarcerated, but she could end up in a penal colony.\n\nUS officials work to secure Griner’s release\n\nWhile Griner’s case plays out, US officials have separately proposed a potential prisoner swap with Russia, offering to exchange convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for Griner and Whelan, an American citizen who’s been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. Whelan, who has consistently denied the charges, was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison.\n\nDespite the “pretty persistent” pace of discussions between the US and Russia to secure the Americans’ release, a senior administration official told CNN last week the Biden administration has yet to receive a serious counteroffer from the Russian side.\n\n“They’re not nonresponsive. I would say that they continue to respond with something that they know not to be feasible or available,” the official said of the Russian response.\n\nFormer Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico – whose namesake center works on behalf of families of hostages and detainees, and who recently traveled to Russia to discuss the possible release of Griner and Whelan – recently said he was “cautiously optimistic” the two Americans could be released.\n\nRichardson, who also served as US ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton, said he’s working with both their families and coordinating with the White House to work toward their releases. The former governor played a role in the release of Trevor Reed, an American veteran detained in Russia for three years before his release in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and their supporters have continued to highlight her case and maintain support and pressure to ensure she’s brought home, starting a #WeAreBG campaign on social media.\n\nThe WNBA on Tuesday reiterated its desire to see Griner brought home, saying in a statement the outcome of her appeal “is further verification that BG is not just wrongfully detained – she is very clearly a hostage.”\n\n“We must unite and support the stated public commitment of the Biden Administration and Congressional leaders to do everything possible to get her home,” the statement said, adding, “No athlete should be used as a political pawn.”\n\nGriner’s agent, Lindsay Colas, called a Moscow court’s rejection of Griner’s appeal “disappointing, yet unsurprising,” and said the basketball star was “being held by Russia simply because she is an American.”\n\nColas thanked the Biden administration and other outside groups for advocating for Griner’s return.\n\nAfter months of pushing, Cherelle Griner met last month with Biden, telling CNN the meeting illustrated the administration’s commitment to bringing her wife home.\n\n“It wasn’t a meeting where the President told me the news that I want to hear,” Cherelle Griner said. “It wasn’t that, but it was one of those still pivotal meetings where … it allowed me to have confidence in what he’s doing right now.”\n\nAs for Griner, she turned 32 last week, celebrating her birthday in a cell in the suburbs of Moscow, her attorneys told CNN. They spent a few hours with her in an effort to “cheer her up” as much as they could, relaying birthday messages from around the world.\n\n“Thank you everyone for fighting so hard to get me home,” Griner said in a message shared by her attorneys. “All the support and love are definitely helping me.”", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Dakin Andone Zahra Ullah", "Anna Chernova", "Dakin Andone", "Zahra Ullah"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/europe/brittney-griner-russia-penal-colony-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "What are the conditions in Russia's penal colonies? Here's what ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS women’s basketball star Brittney Griner is being transferred to a Russian penal colony, where conditions are often tough and have drawn concern from international watchdogs.\n\nRussia’s infamous penal colonies are unlike conventional incarceration in the West. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhere has Griner been sent?\n\nGriner’s attorneys said they didn’t immediately know exactly where her final destination will be. That is not unusual: the process of taking a person to a penal colony is conducted in secrecy in Russia, with relatives and lawyers often unaware of where a prisoner is being sent for several days, according to Amnesty International.\n\nLast month, Griner lost her appeal against a nine-year drug sentence. She was detained in February and convicted in August of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia.\n\nGriner appears in court via a video link last month. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP\n\nShe has repeatedly apologized for bringing a small amount of cannabis into the country, where she played basketball in the off-season.\n\n“Our primary concern continues to be BG’s health and well-being,” her agent Lindsay Colas said. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where BG is or how she is doing, we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.”\n\nGriner’s detention has raised concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nWhat is a penal colony?\n\nThe vast majority of Russia’s prisons are in fact penal colonies, where inmates are housed in barracks instead of cells and are often put to work, according to a report by Poland-based think tank the Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW).\n\nMore than 800 such facilities existed across Russia as of 2019, the organization said.\n\nMost were built during the Soviet Union and have been compared by think tanks and human rights organizations to Soviet-era gulags – tough prison camps that expanded across the region during Joseph Stalin’s rule in the mid-20th century.\n\nRussia houses nearly half a million prisoners across all its incarceration facilities, one of the highest rates in Europe, according to the World Prison Brief – though numbers have declined in recent years, in contrast to most parts of the world.\n\nThe level of supervision and restrictions placed on inmates today depends on what kind of facility they are sentenced to, and not all require labor.\n\nBut a number of high-profile dissidents, activists and foreign nationals who have been sent to strict colonies have described harrowing and difficult experiences.\n\nAn aerial view of the penal colony where jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is serving a sentence. Andrey Borodulin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat are conditions like?\n\nInmates are often taken vast distances across the country, and journeys to colonies are dangerous and can last as long as one month, according to a report by Amnesty International.\n\nThe watchdog said those journeys often take place in cramped train carriages. And inmates often arrive in facilities containing poor and aging infrastructure and suffering from overcrowding, the OSW found.\n\n“Despite several attempts to reform the prison system in Russia, they still resemble the Soviet Gulag: human rights violations and torture are common,” the OSW said.\n\nOne former inmate, Konstantin Kotov, served what he said were two miserable sentences – the first for four months, the second for six months – in Penal Colony No. 2 outside Moscow for breaking Russian anti-protest laws.\n\nHe was last released in December 2020, and last year told CNN about the experience for prisoners.\n\n“From the first minutes you are here you are experiencing mental and moral pressure,” he told CNN.\n\n“You are forced to do things that you would never do in normal life. You are forbidden to talk with other convicts. They force you to learn the list of names of the employees. You are on your feet all day, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. You are not allowed to sit down. They do not allow you to read, they do not allow you to write a letter. It can last two weeks, it can last three weeks.”\n\nKotov explained prisoners sleep in barrack rooms in iron bunk beds. About 50 to 60 men slept in his room, he said, each with only a small amount of living space.\n\n“You get up at 6 in the morning, you go out to the courtyard nearby and listen to the national anthem of Russia – every day the anthem of the Russian Federation,” he said.\n\n“You cannot write, you cannot read. For example, I watched TV almost all day, Russian federal channels. This is torture by TV.”\n\nWhat have other high-profile inmates said?\n\nGriner is not the first well-known figure to be sent to a penal colony. Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was able to offer his initial impressions after arriving at a facility last year, on a post on his official Instagram account.\n\n“I had no idea that it was possible to arrange a real concentration camp 100km from Moscow,” Navalny said, adding his head had been shaven.\n\n“Video cameras are everywhere, everyone is watched and at the slightest violation they make a report. I think someone upstairs read Orwell’s ’1984,’” Navalny continued, in a reference to the classic dystopian novel.\n\nAn Orthodox church on the grounds of Russia's Penal Colony Number 2.

This looks like a strange village, like a Gulag labor camp,” she said, referring to the vast penal network established by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to isolate and crush inmates.\n\n“It actually is a labor camp because by law all the prisoners should work.

For example, they load sacks of flour for a prison bakery or unload mountains of coal,” she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Brittney Griner speak in court during closing arguments 04:41 - Source: CNN\n\nPrisoners could face punishment for inexplicable “offenses” such as placing a wristwatch on a bedside table.\n\nThe ultimate sanction was solitary confinement, known as “the Vatican.”\n\n“Just as the Vatican is a state within a state, solitary confinement is a prison within a prison,” Yelena said.\n\nA gynecologist paid a monthly visit to her colony, where more than 800 women were imprisoned.\n\n“You do the math, what are the chances of being the one to get through to a doctor? Practically zero,” she said.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nFor a foreigner with little or no Russian, it’s harder to navigate the system and deal with the isolation.\n\nThe brother of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine serving 16 years in a Russian penal colony on espionage charges that he denies, said he is granted a 15-minute phone call each day to his parents, cannot call other family members or friends, and has no access to email or the internet.\n\nDavid Whelan said his brother must work at least eight hours a day, six days a week, on menial tasks like making buttonholes, which has caused him repetitive strain injury.\n\nInmates sleep in barrack-like buildings and access to many necessities, including medicine, depends on paying bribes to prison guards, he said.\n\nConditions can depend heavily on the whims of guards, the warden or elder inmates.\n\nPaul seems to use his military training “to get through just day to day, to figure out what battles to fight and which battles not to fight,” David Whelan said.\n\n“His phone calls even to our parents are recorded. His letters were all translated before they went out. So you know that everything you do is being watched and you really have no sense of individuality.”\n\nAlyokhina said receiving cards and letters from the outside world offered a rare ray of hope, and she urged people to support Griner that way.\n\nShe said they should use a machine translation and send the text in both English and Russian to get it more easily past the prison censor.\n\n“Do not leave someone alone with this system,” she said. “It’s totally inhuman, it’s a Gulag, and when you feel yourself alone there, it’s much easier to give up.”", "authors": ["Story Reuters"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2022/07/20/brittney-griner-timeline-russia-detainment-trial/10061213002/", "title": "Brittney Griner timeline of WNBA star's Russia arrest, trial, appeal", "text": "More than eight months have passed since Brittney Griner attempted to enter Russia and instead wound up facing drug charges that could keep her imprisoned for years.\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medal winner and eight-time WNBA All-Star is being \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the United States government, by Russia on charges of bringing vape cartridges filled with hashish oil in her luggage while returning to play for her professional team there.\n\nGriner remained in pre-trial detention for more than three months prior to this month's trial.

The eight-time all-star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury and two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted Aug. 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport.\n\nHer arrest came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, and the politically charged case could lead to a high-stakes prisoner exchange between Washington and Moscow.\n\nMORE:Brittney Griner en route to a Russian penal colony. What's next for the WNBA star?\n\n“Every minute that Brittney Griner must endure wrongful detention in Russia is a minute too long,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “As we have said before, the U.S. Government made a significant offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful detentions of American citizens.”\n\nGriner’s legal team said she left a detention center outside Moscow on Nov. 4 for a penal colony — as prisons in Russia are commonly known. The move was expected since she lost her appeal.\n\nSuch transfers can take days or even weeks, during which time lawyers and loved ones usually don’t have contact with the prisoner. Even after she arrives, access to Griner may be difficult since many penal colonies are in remote parts of Russia.\n\nHer lawyers said Wednesday that they did not know exactly where she was or where she would end up — but that they expected to be notified when she reached her final destination.\n\nIn a statement stressing the work being done to secure Griner’s release, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted that Russian authorities give the embassy regular access to Griner, as they are required to do. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow visited Griner last week.\n\nA senior State Department official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case, said the Russians had not notified American diplomats of Griner’s transfer ahead of time and had not yet responded to queries from the American embassy about either her current whereabouts or ultimate destination.\n\nIn many penal colonies, prisoners work for minimal pay, and dissidents and other countries have denounced the conditions of those held. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny went on a hunger strike to protest his treatment, including officials’ refusal to give him the right medicines and to allow his doctor to visit him behind bars.\n\nHe also protested the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night, saying they amount to sleep deprivation torture.\n\nGriner, 32, who was detained while returning to play for a Russian team during the WNBA’s offseason, has admitted that she had the canisters in her luggage. But she testified that she had inadvertently packed them in haste and that she had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements that she had been prescribed cannabis to treat pain.\n\nThe Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan — an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage — for Viktor Bout. Bout is a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the “merchant of death.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2022/08/04/brittney-griner-convicted-russia-sentenced-nine-years-drug-charges/10053711002/", "title": "Brittney Griner convicted, sentenced to nine years in Russian prison", "text": "A Russian judge sentenced Brittney Griner to nine years in a penal colony after the WNBA star and two-time United States Olympic gold medalist was found guilty of drug possession.\n\nGriner, who entered a guilty plea weeks ago, apologized to her family and wife.\n\n“I made an honest mistake, and I hope that in your ruling, it doesn’t end my life here,\" Griner said addressing the judge.\n\nNow that the trial has concluded, negotiations to free Griner are expected to continue between Washington and Moscow during a period of tension between the two countries.\n\nGriner, who had played for Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2014 during the WNBA offseason, was arrested Feb. 17 at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Russian authorities said she carried vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage; Griner said during the trial that took place in Khmiki, Russia, that she accidentally packed them in haste and pleaded guilty \"without intent.\" The court, however, claimed she committed the crime deliberately.\n\n“The hard work that my parents instilled in me is what brought me to play for the best EuroLeague and Russian team here in Ekaterinburg,” Griner said Thursday from a cage inside the courtroom. “I want to apologize to my teammates, the club, the fans and the city of (Ekaterinburg for) the mistake that I made and the embarrassment I brought.\n\n“This is my second home. All I wanted to do was win a championship and make them proud.”\n\nExperts in the Russian legal system – which has a 99% conviction rate – said admitting to the transgression could result in leniency on the 10-year maximum sentence Griner faced.\n\nThe lead prosecutor against Griner asked the judge to sentence her to nine years and six months in a prison colony.\n\n“I know everybody keeps talking about 'political pawn' and politics. But I hope that is far from this courtroom,” Griner said.\n\nMaria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, Griner’s lawyers in Russia, previously advocated for leniency in a statement. The defense team presented character witnesses from her Russian team and written testimony from a doctor who said he recommended her cannabis for pain treatment.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now for daily updates sent to your inbox\n\nMORE ON CANNABIS:Brittney Griner's use is normal in America. But Russia's drug laws are 'draconian.'\n\nTIMELINE:What has happened since the WNBA star was detained\n\n\"Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence,\" they said.\n\nGriner's lawyers called the verdict \"absolutely unreasonable\" and said it did not account for her plea. They will file an appeal.\n\nGriner, 31, won the 2014 WNBA title in her second season with the Phoenix Mercury, the only WNBA team for which she has played. She is a two-time scoring champion and has led the league in blocks eight times. She also won gold for Team USA women’s basketball at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.\n\nIn a joint statement, the WNBA and NBA said: \"Today's verdict and sentencing is unjustified and unfortunate ... it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States.\"\n\nGriner’s arrest did not become public knowledge until nearly three weeks after it occurred. Americans arrested abroad typically have consular access – a staffer at the nearest U.S. Embassy can provide legal assistance. Griner was unable to meet with any representative of the U.S. government until March 23.\n\nOn May 3, the U.S. State Department officially classified her as “wrongfully detained,” and her case moved into the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Her trial, referred to as a \"sham\" by those with expertise in the Russian legal system, began July 1. Prosecutors argued Griner had less than one gram of cannabis in her luggage.\n\nThe most likely way the U.S. will secure the early release of Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, who has also been classified as \"wrongfully detained,\" is via prisoner swap – similar to the one that brought Trevor Reed back from Russia earlier this year. Whelan has been in custody since 2018 and is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges the U.S. government disputes.\n\n\"American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after Griner's sentencing. \"It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates.\n\n\"My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe State Department, in an extraordinary move last week, revealed the existence of a \"substantial offer\" to free Griner and Whelan. The prisoner swap revolved around notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed \"The Merchant of Death.\" Last Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov connected for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nThe war and sanctions placed on Russia by the United States have led to tension between the two countries. Griner's supporters at home have referred to her as a \"political pawn.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Griner released excerpts of her letter to President Joe Biden on July 4. The Texas native wrote to Biden: \"I’m terrified I might be here forever. Please do all you can to bring us home.\"\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris called Cherelle Griner, Brittney's wife, later that week for the first time since her arrest. Cherelle Griner has repeatedly called on the government to increase the urgency in returning her spouse.\n\nRussian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned after the second day of Griner's trial that “attempts by the American side to make noise in public ... don’t help the practical settlement of issues.”\n\nBlinken said in a statement Thursday: \"This step puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.\n\n\"Nothing about today’s decision changes our determination that Brittney Griner is wrongfully detained, and we will continue working to bring Brittney and fellow wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan home.

CBD is a non-psychoactive component of cannabis that is often sold other products such as lotions and supplements.\n\nCertain cannabis-infused products, including CBD oil, are illegal at the federal level if they contain more than 0.3 percent of THC on a dry weight basis.\n\nIt is not clear if the cartridges that Russian officials says Griner was carrying had either or both CBD or THC.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has only approved one cannabis-derived product, Epidiolex, which has a purified form of CBD, the agency said in January 2021, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products: Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone). These are only available with prescriptions by licensed healthcare providers.\n\nTSA doesn't search for drugs\n\nTransportation Security Administration officers are required to report suspected violations of law to local state, or federal authorities, but they do not search for illegal drugs during the screenings.\n\n“TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, but if any illegal substance is discovered during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer,” the website states.\n\nTSA said their dogs aren’t sniffing for marijuana either. However, on an Instagram post they reiterated that if during the screening a substance that appears to be marijuana or a cannabis infused product is found, law enforcement will be notified, even if it is used for medicinal purposes.\n\nTraveling internationally with cannabis products\n\nThere is no specific guidance for traveling with cannabis products internationally, but as federal laws apply to anyone, if a product is illegal in a country, traveling with it could bring consequences.\n\nFor example, cannabis is legal for adults in Canada but the government website for travel and tourism states it is illegal to transport these products across Canadian borders regardless of the amount of cannabis and medical authorizations.\n\n“Cannabis is illegal in most countries. If you try to travel internationally with any amount of cannabis in your possession, you could face serious criminal penalties both at home and abroad,” the Canadian government website states.\n\nColumn:Will Russians do the smart thing and free Mercury center Brittney Griner?\n\nThis applies even if the person is traveling to or from a place where cannabis has been decriminalized, according to the website. Consequences for traveling with cannabis products includes being denied entry into a country.\n\n“You could be denied entry at your destination country if you have previously used cannabis or any substance prohibited by local laws,” the website states. “You could also be denied entry to other countries in the future.”\n\nTwo women arrested in recent years for similar reasons in Russia\n\nIn Russia, marijuana is illegal for recreational and medical purposes.\n\nAn Israeli-American woman was arrested at a Moscow airport in April 2019 as she was traveling from India to Israel and nine grams of marijuana were found in her luggage, BBC News reported.\n\nNaama Issachar, 26, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for drug trafficking charges. The BBC reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned her in January 2020 ahead of a visit of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister at the moment, to Moscow.\n\nA New York-based film student was charged with drug possession in St. Petersburg for allegedly taking medical marijuana into the country, The Moscow Times reported in September 2019.\n\nCBS News reported Audrey Lorber was detained when she arrived in St. Petersburg for vacation and authorities found about 19 grams of marijuana on her. She said the drug was for medical reasons and showed the prescription but police said it wasn’t valid in Russia, CBS reported.\n\nLorber spent more than a month in a detention sentence. A court in St. Petersburg fined her for 15,000 rubles or $230 after finding her guilty.\n\nHowever, not all are convinced Griner's arrest is just an example of Russia enforcing its drug laws among travelers. U.S. Cannabis Council CEO Steven Hawkins said in a statement Sunday that “cannabis possession, alleged or real, is routinely used as a pretext by law enforcement around the world to target disfavored individuals and groups.\n\n\"In this case, Russian authorities appear to be using alleged cannabis possession as a pretext for holding a prominent American as leverage. Brittney Griner must not be used as a pawn by Russia. We urge the U.S. government to use all available channels to secure her speedy return home.”\n\nReach breaking news reporter Angela Cordoba Perez at Angela.CordobaPerez@Gannett.com or on Twitter @AngelaCordobaP.\n\nSupport local journalism.

Midterms\n\nThe fight for control of Congress – both the House of Representatives and the Senate – still hangs in the balance as results continue to trickle in from crucial midterm contests. It’s too early to call key races – including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona – that could determine which party controls the chambers. But in closely-watched Pennsylvania, Democrat John Fetterman will win the state’s Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pickup is a big boost to Democrats’ hopes of clinging to the Senate. Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority, one that favored Republicans, remains unsettled as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize.\n\n2. Abortion\n\nVoters in three states moved to protect abortion rights on Tuesday after a monthslong push from Democrats nationwide to act on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. While CNN has projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in Michigan, California and Vermont passed initiatives that will protect the right to the procedure. Some measures are still too early to call, including an amendment to Kentucky’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion. Meanwhile, voters in Montana considered a ballot referendum that would impose criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion.\n\n3. Inflation\n\nHigh prices for food, gas and other essentials were at the top of mind for voters as they cast ballots in this year’s midterms, according to preliminary results of national and state exit polls. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation – which has hovered around 40-year highs – has caused them severe or moderate hardship. The exit poll results, conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research, are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy. Roughly half of voters also said they approve President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness effort, while nearly the same disapprove.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Tropical Storm Nicole\n\nTropical Storm Nicole is expected to slam into Florida’s east coast as a possible Category 1 hurricane in less than 24 hours, prompting evacuations in areas still recovering from Hurricane Ian. Nearly four million people along Florida’s east coast are under hurricane warnings as Nicole is poised to make landfall late Wednesday north of West Palm Beach. The National Hurricane Center predicts the coastal area will receive up to 8 inches of rain and storm surge that could rise to 5 feet. Separately, the storm is barreling toward the launch site of NASA’s Artemis I mission. As a result, the launch – which aims to send an uncrewed spacecraft on a test mission around the moon – has been delayed yet again.\n\n5.

{"question_id": "20221111_7", "search_time": "2022/11/12/01:10", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/tech/twitter-midterms-misinformation/index.html", "title": "Twitter could be a new wild card for the midterms | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nFor years, Twitter has been a leader in countering misinformation and protecting elections. It was often ahead of its peers in creating and enforcing new policies, and it was the first major platform to ban former President Donald Trump after the Capitol insurrection, pushing others to follow suit.\n\nBut concerns are growing that tumult inside Twitter in the first week after it was acquired by Elon Musk could weaken its safeguards for elections, just before the midterms are set to take place.\n\nMusk’s Twitter laid off thousands of employees across the company last week, including cuts to its public policy and trust and safety teams, and extensive cuts to its curation team, which helps elevate reliable information on the platform about elections and other news events. The chaos was only amplified over the weekend as Twitter first appeared to roll out, and then postponed, a controversial plan allowing any user to pay to be verified — a proposal critics had said would cause confusion during the midterms about which accounts and tweets users could trust.\n\nMusk promised not to alter any of Twitter’s content policies until after the midterms. But the changes he has already made to the company have left it weakened and vulnerable, said Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.\n\n“The Musk-induced Category 5 hurricane at Twitter has the potential to disrupt the midterms,” Barrett said, “because large numbers of Twitter employees who otherwise would be paying attention to misuse of the platform have already been fired, are worrying that they’re next on the chopping block, or are distracted by the plight of co-workers being ushered out the door.”\n\nThe threats Twitter could face on Election Day and its aftermath include known risks, such as misleading claims of election fraud, attempts at voter intimidation or violent rhetoric, Barrett said. But the disarray at Twitter also means the company will be even less equipped to identify and counter novel manipulation tactics for which there is no playbook, he added.\n\nUS officials overseeing the election say there is so far no evidence of any specific or credible threats to election infrastructure, but made clear private platforms such as Twitter are on their own, and responsible for managing any misinformation that may appear on their sites.\n\n“We don’t flag anything to platforms around misinformation, disinformation,” Jen Easterly, director of the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told CNN Saturday evening. “That is entirely up to those platforms — Twitter, social media — based on their terms of service and how they enforce it.”\n\nDeep cuts\n\nTwitter has said it’s still committed to protecting elections and that the job cuts last week — which struck half of the company’s workforce — were less extensive in its trust and safety team, where about 15% of workers were let go.\n\nTwitter didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story, and attempts to reach one company spokesperson resulted in an email bounce-back message that implied they were no longer with the company. The layoffs appear to have hit large swaths of Twitter’s PR team, with numerous officials saying their time at the company has ended, including Brian Poliakoff, Twitter’s global head of corporate and customer communications, and Julie Steele, its former head of internal communications.\n\nBut the company has been largely opaque about how exactly the layoffs may hinder Twitter’s ability to combat misinformation. When addressing the layoffs Friday, Yoel Roth, the company’s head of safety and integrity, said 80% of Twitter’s incoming content moderation volume had been “completely unaffected,” as was the daily volume of actions Twitter took to moderate content. But Roth was describing Twitter’s ability to moderate content in relation to an internal policy change made the week prior, not staffing cuts, and the period he referenced ended prior to the mass layoffs of Nov. 3 and 4.\n\n“With early voting underway in the US, our efforts on election integrity — including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations — remain a top priority,” said Roth on Friday evening.\n\nBut while Twitter’s cuts to its content moderation workforce may have been less severe than at other parts of the company, the broad layoffs in certain cases eliminated whole teams, some with important roles to play in election coverage.\n\nOne of them was reportedly Twitter’s curation team, according to tweets by ex-employees, including Andrew Haigh, Twitter’s former senior curation lead for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The curation team had been responsible for the site’s Moments feature, which showcased important world events and explained to users why certain topics were trending.\n\nIn recent years, Moments were increasingly being used to debunk misinformation or highlight major news stories, according to a person familiar with the inner workings of the curation team — in other words, the person said, “the type of coverage you’d want on election day.”\n\nCivil rights leaders have slammed the layoffs, saying that no matter what Twitter claims, the reduced headcount will impair Twitter’s ability to enforce its election policies even if the rules themselves have not changed.\n\n“He cannot enforce content moderation policies if he doesn’t have the staff to do so,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press. (Roth said Friday evening that “front-line moderation staff” were among the least affected by the cuts.)\n\nA messy product rollout\n\nCivil rights groups have spearheaded a campaign targeting Twitter’s largest advertisers, calling on them to pause their ad spend on the platform. Already this past week, major brands including General Mills and Audi have suspended their Twitter advertising, contributing to what Musk has called a steep revenue decline at the company.\n\nTo shore up Twitter’s finances, Musk has proposed a paid verification feature enabling any user to pay $8 a month to receive a blue check mark on their profiles. But that too could lead to its own form of election chaos by making it harder to weed out misinformation.\n\nTwitter on Saturday appeared to roll out an app update for iOS users that suggested the feature was already live for users in the United States and other English-speaking countries.\n\nHowever, the product didn’t match the marketing — users found that while they could pay for the subscription service, Twitter Blue, the promised check marks did not appear on user profiles.\n\nEsther Crawford, a director of product management at Twitter, confirmed the service was not yet live, writing on Saturday in a tweet: “The new Blue isn’t live yet — the sprint to our launch continues but some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time.”\n\nThe company delayed the rollout of account verifications for its paid Twitter Blue subscription plan until after the midterm elections, a source with knowledge of the decision confirmed to CNN.\n\nPolicy whiplash\n\nEven if Musk’s seemingly rushed decisions don’t complicate Election Day itself, they could introduce added uncertainty in the critical period afterward as votes are counted — not to mention the 2024 presidential campaign, which could kick off later this month as Trump reportedly nears a formal announcement of his run.\n\nThe sprint to roll out an untested feature opens the door to unintended consequences following the election, such as the potential impersonation of election officials, said civil rights groups.\n\n“Any right-wing troll can pay $8… get a blue check mark, and then change their name to CNN or Georgia’s secretary of state,” Rashad Robinson, CEO of Color of Change, told reporters on the call.\n\nMusk has argued that charging for a blue check mark will fight spammers by increasing their costs. But misinformation researchers have told CNN well-resourced adversaries, such as highly motivated state-backed actors looking to meddle in elections, would simply see the paid verification as another cost of doing business.\n\nChris Krebs, the former CISA director, said Musk’s proposal changes the meaning of verification and alters the information that the symbol conveys to the user. “The verified logo has been a marker of trust I.e. ‘We’ve confirmed the person is who they say they are,’” Krebs tweeted. “Now it’s ‘we’re taking their $ & their word for it.’”\n\nThose complications became apparent over the weekend after a number of celebrities, including comedians Sarah Silverman and Kathy Griffin, used their verified status to mock the billionaire’s plan, by renaming themselves Elon Musk and changing their profiles to resemble his.\n\nHours later, Musk walked back one of his signature pledges — that permanent bans would be “extremely rare” under his rule. He tweeted: “Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended,” and without warning.\n\nWhile the abrupt and sweeping policy change announced in a weekend tweet appears likely to cover accounts impersonating election officials, Musk did not explain the change as a response to election security concerns.\n\nThe shakeup at Twitter has turned the company itself into an election wildcard.\n\n“My instinct is that the actual impacts of these changes may take a bit longer to be felt,” John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity and disinformation researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. “But they are going to be dramatic.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/tech/twitter-chaos-musk/index.html", "title": "A day of chaos brings Twitter closer to the brink | CNN Business", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nTwo weeks after Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, the future of the company has never looked less certain.\n\nIn the past week alone, one of the world’s most influential social networks has laid off half its workforce; alienated powerful advertisers; blown up key aspects of its product, then repeatedly launched and un-launched other features aimed at compensating for it; and witnessed an exodus of senior executives.\n\nThe wild swings at Twitter only seemed to accelerate on Thursday with more executive departures, growing chaos over fake, verified accounts and an unusual public rebuke from the US government. Twitter now appears to be on the brink, a point Musk himself seemed to concede on Thursday by reportedly telling employees that bankruptcy could be on the horizon (though it’s far from the first time he’s warned about bankruptcy at one of his companies).\n\n“Quite the day!” Musk tweeted.\n\nIt’s a stunning reversal of fortunes not just for Musk, who bought the company for $44 billion, but also for a platform used by some of the most powerful people on the planet, including world leaders, CEOs, and the Pope.\n\nAn end to the disruption seemed nowhere in sight on Friday. In its latest reversal on the matter, Twitter said it would re-introduce a gray “Official” badge for select accounts to help confirm their identities. The decision came after Twitter was forced to fend off a wave of verified-account impostors this week, including some posing as former President Donald Trump, Nintendo, and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, among others. These accounts were the result of Musk’s decision to rush ahead with offering a blue check mark to any account holder willing to pay $8 a month, no questions asked, as he races to find new ways to make money from the platform.\n\nThat paid subscription service, too, was also suspended on Friday with little warning, just two days after its official launch, with the menu option to sign up for Twitter Blue suddenly disappearing from Twitter’s iOS app — the only place the add-on had been offered. It was not immediately clear when the company might restore the offering.\n\nThe gray “Official” badge has become an illustration of the whiplash users, employees, and advertisers have experienced in recent days.\n\nHours after the gray badges launched on Wednesday as a way to help users differentiate legitimate celebrity and branded accounts from accounts that had merely paid for a blue check mark, Musk abruptly tweeted that he had “killed” the feature, forcing subordinates to explain the reversal.\n\n“We’re not currently putting an ‘Official’ label on accounts but we are aggressively going after impersonation and deception,” Twitter’s verified support account tweeted on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe account’s very next tweet, a day and nine hours later, said exactly the opposite: “To combat impersonation, we’ve added an ‘Official’ label to some accounts.”\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the changes to the rollout of Twitter Blue or “Official” badges.\n\nThe paid verification feature’s rocky rollout attracted widespread criticism from misinformation experts who had warned it would make identifying trustworthy information much more difficult, particularly in the critical period following the US midterm elections. Even some of Musk’s fellow high-powered users of the platform had tough feedback.\n\n“@elonmusk, from one entrepreneur to another, for when you have your customer service hat on. I just spent too much time muting all the newly purchased checkmark accts in an attempt to make my verified mentions useful again,” tweeted billionaire Mark Cuban.\n\n“Bottom line is that you have a decision to make,” Cuban added. “Stick with the new Twitter that democratizes every tweet by paid accounts and puts the onus on all users to curate for themselves. Or bring back Twitter curation. One makes Twitter time and information efficient. The other is awful.”\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces event held for advertisers this week, Musk pleaded with brands to keep using the platform, after a growing number of companies paused ads, causing what Musk previously described as a “massive drop in revenue.” In the event, Musk sought to appear magnanimous in accepting responsibility for the company’s performance.\n\n“If things go wrong, it’s my fault, because the buck stops with me,” he told an audience of over 100,000 listeners.\n\nBut privately, Musk’s critics have described the billionaire as dismissive of accountability, even in the face of scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, which publicly warned on Thursday, in a rare forward-looking statement, that it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”\n\nAccording to an internal Slack message posted by a Twitter employee and viewed by CNN, Musk has shown little fear of the FTC regulators overseeing the company’s multiple, legally binding consent agreements committing it to maintaining a robust cybersecurity program and producing written privacy impact reports before launching any new products or services, a requirement that could cover Twitter Blue.\n\nThe company is already facing billions in potential fines from the FTC over alleged privacy missteps dating to before Musk’s ownership. But, the Twitter employee warned colleagues, Twitter could find itself even more legally exposed after the sudden resignation of multiple top Twitter executives charged with fulfilling the company’s FTC obligations, including its chief information security officer and chief privacy officer.\n\nForced to address the looming risk of FTC oversight, Musk reportedly struck a conciliatory tone.\n\n“Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree,” Musk reportedly wrote in an email to employees Thursday evening.\n\nThe one thing Musk claims is going in his favor at Twitter is user growth, as more people tune in to watch him fumble his way through owning the company.\n\n“Twitter usage is at an all-time high,” Musk tweeted earlier this week, before adding in a follow-up tweet: “I just hope the servers don’t melt!”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/media/top-gun-maverick-taiwan-flag-reinstated-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' brings back Taiwan flag after ...", "text": "Hong Kong/Taipei CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” is now showing Taiwan’s official flag after an outcry, putting its release in mainland China in jeopardy.\n\nThe box office mega-hit — which is by far Tom Cruise’s biggest-ever commercial debut — now features his character sporting the flag on his iconic bomber jacket, including in the version shown in Taiwan.\n\nInitially, the film’s trailer in 2019 had shown otherwise. During the preview, the patches on Cruise’s jacket, which originally bore flags that represent Taiwan and Japan, appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme.\n\nThat omission had angered some critics, prompting speculation that the change was made to appease Chinese censors and the film’s Chinese backer, Tencent (TCEHY). At the time, Tencent (TCEHY) Pictures, a subsidiary of the Shenzhen-based tech giant, was an investor of the highly anticipated sequel to the 1986 classic.\n\nNow, however, the company has pulled out. The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unidentified sources, that Tencent had relinquished its role as a financier of the film in late 2019, amid geopolitical concerns between China and the United States.\n\nThe firm was worried about falling out of line with officials in Beijing for promoting a movie that celebrated the American military as US-Chinese relations soured, according to the report. Tencent and Paramount (PGRE) Pictures, the studio behind the film, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA sensitive topic\n\nChina and Taiwan have a complex relationship. Beijing’s communist leadership has long claimed Taiwan, a self-governed democratic island, as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.\n\nAs part of its campaign, the Chinese government has pressured multinational companies to refer to Taiwan as a Chinese territory, in exchange for accessing its lucrative market.\n\nThe drive has been largely successful, with players like United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), Marriott (MAR), American Express (AXP), and Goldman Sachs (GS) falling in line. Hollywood films have also been increasingly censored over the years as China grew in importance to the global box office.\n\nChinese and Japanese relations have also long been fraught, with tensions flaring in recent years over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nIn the trailer of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" two jacket patches that had originally shown the Japanese and Taiwanese flags (left) appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme. @markmackinnon/TWITTER\n\nNow, the film’s update is likely to anger some fans and officials in mainland China.\n\n“There’s a high probability Beijing will ban the release and monetization of ‘Top Gun’ in China,” said Chris Fenton, former president of DMG Entertainment and author of the book “Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion-Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business.”\n\n“There’s also a probability the Chinese government will blackball the studio, filmmakers, and actors from the market for an extended period of time,” Fenton added. “We’ve witnessed similar punishments in the past.”\n\nSince 2020, China’s strict “zero Covid” restrictions have left many cinemas shuttered for extended periods of time, including in Shanghai and Beijing. That’s in sharp contrast with how moviegoers elsewhere have recently flocked back to theaters around the world.\n\nCurrently, “Top Gun: Maverick” has not been released in mainland China, and does not have a set opening date.\n\nBut Fenton noted “that may have been a forgone conclusion anyway,” given the heightened geopolitical tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“A film strongly promoting Western ideals and US military hegemony probably never stood a chance for approval,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that the Chinese film market has recently eschewed Hollywood movies in favor of other titles. In recent months, patriotic propaganda war movies have topped the box office domestically.\n\n“That’s a likely calculation that led to the decision [for producers to include Taiwan’s flag],” said Fenton. “The global goodwill generated by reinstating the flags easily outweighs any potential revenues from China.”\n\nThe move delighted fans in Taiwan: Social media users there cheered the decision online this week, with some calling it a “pleasant surprise.”\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” in which Cruise reprises his role as Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, has already smashed box office records, taking in more than $300 million worldwide, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the latest round of blockbusters, including “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” were still able to enjoy “massive international success” despite limitations from “some countries.”\n\n“Hollywood is starting to realize the aggravation of attempting to please China’s fickle and unpredictable censors is no longer worth the potential payoff,” said Fenton.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Wayne Chang", "Michelle Toh", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/cars/volkswagen-electric-vehicles/index.html", "title": "Volkswagen has already sold out of electric cars in key markets this ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nVolkswagen Group, the leading global competitor to Tesla (TSLA), has sold out of electric cars in the United States and Europe this year because of soaring demand and supply constraints.\n\n“We are not sold out because we can’t build cars … we are really sold out for electric cars because demand is higher than expected,” CEO Herbert Diess told the Financial Times at its automotive conference Monday.\n\nLast week, the company, which owns several brands including Porsche and Audi, said it had a backlog of 300,000 EV orders in Western Europe alone.\n\nCustomers placing orders now in some markets can expect to receive their cars next year, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business.\n\nVolkswagen Group sold more than 99,000 electric vehicles globally in the first quarter, up 65% from the same period last year. Its most popular cars included its ID.3 and ID.4 models, and the Audi e-tron.\n\nVolkswagen still trails Tesla, which delivered more than three times as many EVs over the same period.\n\nSupply woes ease up\n\nIt may have an opportunity to make up some lost ground later this year as the supply of chips improves. Supply chain disruptions that have blighted the car industry over the past year were starting to ease up, and Volkswagen Group has a “very good semiconductor supply” from the third quarter, Diess said.\n\nVolvo (VOLAF), a Volkswagen Group competitor, also believes the worst of the chip shortage is behind it. CEO Jim Rowan told the FT on Monday that he thinks his company will be “really solid in terms of chip supply” from the second quarter.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has compounded supply problems for the automotive sector, leading to shortages of key parts for all vehicles.\n\nBut Diess said the company, which has several parts suppliers in Ukraine, still managed to secure about 90% of its supply volumes from those plants.\n\nAnd despite strict coronavirus lockdowns, demand for EVs within China is proving resilient. Diess said Volkswagen Group EV sales in the world’s biggest car market had quadrupled in the first quarter.\n\nBYD, a Chinese electric vehicle maker, reported a 313% jump in sales across its electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in April compared with last year. The Warren Buffett-backed company is more insulated than others from supply chain disruptions because it makes its own batteries and automotive chips. Rivals Li Auto and Nio both reported a drop in deliveries in April.\n\n“I’m optimistic that even under these really difficult circumstances with Covid in China, the war in Ukraine and still some semiconductor constraints, 2022 could still be a good year for us and the rest of the industry,” Diess said.\n\n— Laura He contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/success/salary-ranges-pay-transparency/index.html", "title": "Here's what happens when salary is actually included in job listings ...", "text": "Job listings can be extremely detailed, with long lists of responsibilities and required skills, descriptions of company culture and perks, and numerous other reasons for why you might want to work there. But there’s often one glaring omission: the pay.\n\nOnly about 12% of postings from US online job sites include salary ranges, according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. And that’s an increase from 8% in 2019.\n\nPart of the reason for the uptick is the stronger job market, Pollak said. “A tightening labor market does appear to have caused more companies to disclose pay rates,” she said.\n\nBut a growing number of companies will soon be required by their local governments to disclose what they’ll pay.\n\nA new law in New York City, for example, requires employers to include a salary range on job listings. The law, which goes into effect in May, applies to employers with four or more employees, and excludes temporary staffing firms.\n\n“Our new law shines a light on pay inequity,” Helen Rosenthal, a former City Council member and sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement last month. “Including pay ranges in job postings allows job seekers to determine whether they will be able to support themselves and their family when they apply for a job.”\n\nColorado has a similar law that has been in effect since January 2021, and a few other states, like Rhode Island and Maryland, have legislation that requires employers to provide salary ranges upon request.\n\nWhy the big secret?\n\nLabor costs are a major expense for companies, and staying mum on what they’re willing to pay can enable them to hire candidates for less, said Katie Donovan, founder of consultancy Equal Pay Negotiations.\n\n“Companies don’t want informed consumers … because the more informed the consumer is, the harder it is to negotiate a savings of any kind,” she said. “There’s definitely a mindset that the job of recruiting and hiring is to bring in the best person at not a penny more than needed. And the best way to do that is don’t tell them how much you actually have available.”\n\nKeeping the number under wraps can also be a negotiation strategy. “The person who says a number first loses,” said Donovan.\n\nPublishing salary information also means that competitors and current employees can see what a company is paying.\n\nIn some cases, current employees may discover that they are underpaid, which could lead them to demand more or find a new job.\n\n“That’s the scary part, that is why [companies] aren’t putting it in writing,” she said.\n\nWhy it’s good for employers\n\nBut posting salaries can also be advantageous to companies when it comes to negotiating, said Zoe Cullen, assistant professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\n“Firms that firmly set a price for a particular job have a high degree of bargaining power in the sense that they are announcing to potential job candidates that, ‘if you try to negotiate anything higher than this price, it is going to effect everybody else because I will have to publicly adjust the going rate for this job.’”\n\nSharing salary ranges can also help attract workers.\n\n“When people are searching for work, [compensation] is the most salient concern typically. So if they don’t find the [salary] information they need, they may not waste the time going through the process at all,” said Pollak.\n\nAt the same time, employers can also create a more qualified applicant pool.\n\n“It saves them the time and energy of searching through candidates who are never going to accept the job… people will self-select out when the [salary] is too little,” said Donovan.\n\nShe added that when companies are more upfront about salaries, it can help create trust. “They feel more respected and apply more when there is the information…it’s like ‘OK, they are treating me like a human being.’”\n\nWhy it’s good for job hunters…\n\nFor starters, published salary ranges help job seekers understand what the market is willing to pay for certain positions.\n\n“If you have the ability to know what salary is being offered and know what others are earning, then you are in a position to advocate for yourself,” said Laurie Berke-Weiss, principal attorney at Berke-Weiss, a labor and employment law firm in New York City.\n\nKnowing what a job pays from the start can also make the job-hunting process more streamlined. In the current tight labor market, candidates are being more selective about what roles they apply for, and advertised salary ranges can help them narrow down their options.\n\n“Role descriptions can be made to sound more than they are and [job seekers] can go deep into the process and realize that the salary is significantly lower than what they make right now,” said Rohan Rajiv, group product manager at LinkedIn. He added that LinkedIn job postings that included salary information increased by 50% in January 2022 from January 2021.\n\nLaws requiring salary disclosure, as well as other laws like banning companies from asking about salary history, can also help with pay equity.\n\nStudies show women and people of color tend to be paid less than White men in the same roles. To right the issue would require significant salary increases.\n\n“Mathematically, for a Hispanic women to answer the question: What are you looking to earn in this job? For her to say the same number as a White guy, she would have to increase her current pay by over 100%… just based on statistics,” said Donovan.\n\n...And also for existing employees\n\nPosting salary ranges can be enlightening for current employees as well.\n\n“[If employees] see that they can get a 20% increase just by going to the competition, they’ll start paying attention to their openings,” said Donovan.\n\nSuch transparency can also help existing employees know if they’re underpaid.\n\n“Most people think that the people with longer tenure [at a company] are making more than the new kid that just started. But no, the new kid is probably making more,” said Donovan. “The new kid is getting paid the current market value and your 2% [annual] raise hasn’t kept up with the market rate.”\n\nCullen’s research shows that employers’ public disclosures of pay ranges can reduce a worker’s bargaining power and limit their ability to ask for more beyond the range.\n\nBut there’s more to compensation than what’s on a paycheck. Companies can also offer benefits like signing bonuses, stock options, and other perks that they might not always be required to be disclosed.\n\n“You can have a company that is very openly, publicly committed to pay transparency, but if they really want a candidate who requires more to take the job than they initially offer, they can find ways to make that posted salary range still hold,” said Pollak. “Companies can find all kinds of creative ways to get around these requirements.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/tech/abortion-laws-data-privacy/index.html", "title": "How your phone could be used in abortion criminalization | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUpdate: This story was originally published on May 6. It has been updated to reflect the Supreme Court’s final decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s Friday ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade is almost certain to spark a wave of new state legislation taking aim at abortion rights, and to reinforce existing laws that prohibit and, in some cases, criminalize the procedure. Among the wide-ranging potential implications of the decision are concerns about the potential use of personal data to punish people who look for information about or access to abortion services online.\n\nIn some of the most restrictive states, digital rights experts warn that people’s search histories, location data, messages and other digital information could be used by law enforcement agencies investigating or prosecuting abortion-related cases.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old ruling that guaranteed a person’s Constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability (usually around 24 weeks). A draft of the opinion leaked in May. Overturning the landmark 1973 court ruling is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America, leaving abortion policy up to individual states and potentially paving the way for more than 20 states to pass new laws restricting abortions.\n\nEven before the ruling, concerns about the digital privacy implications of abortion restrictions had started to arise amid a movement by Republican-controlled states, including Georgia, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, in recent years to pass laws severely curtailing access to the service.\n\nAmerica is a much different place today than in the pre-Roe era: Because of the pervasiveness of the Internet and mobile technology, people today share vast troves of data about themselves — whether they realize it or not — opening the door to significant surveillance. The possibility of a complex patchwork of state laws following the rolling back of Roe v. Wade raises a host of new questions about the everyday technology Americans use to make health decisions and how it might be used to enforce those laws, and could create confusion about what online behavior is permitted or not.\n\nFor example, in states that make it a crime to help an abortion-seeker, data from women’s period-tracking or pregnancy apps could end up being subpoenaed as evidence against the person who helped them, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of the forthcoming book “The Fight for Privacy.” “Let’s say you got your period, stopped your period and then got your period again in a short time,” Citron said. “It’s [potential] evidence of your own criminality, or your doctor’s criminality.”\n\nGroups promoting digital rights and reproductive freedoms are now warning people in states that criminalize providing access to abortions to safeguard their digital footprints when seeking abortion information and resources online and sharing tips for how to do so.\n\n“We are living in a much more surveilled culture than we were in 1972 and prior, so in a future where abortion rights are limited or there’s not a federal right, people will be at risk for exercising their bodily autonomy,” said Elisabeth Smith, director for State Policy and Advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “The consequences of those decisions are likely to fall hardest on Black, brown, Indigenous people of color.”\n\nA growing number of US lawmakers have expressed alarm about the potential misuse of advertising data to prosecute abortion-seekers. In May, dozens of congressional Democrats wrote to Google saying that the company’s practice of collecting and storing vast troves of geolocation data from cellphones “will allow it to become a tool for far-right extremists looking to crack down on people seeking reproductive health care.” And on June 24, the same day the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, another group of US lawmakers wrote to the Federal Trade Commission saying Apple and Google should face an agency investigation over ad practices that they said could end up harming abortion-seekers.\n\n“Data brokers are already selling, licensing, and sharing the location information of people that visit abortion providers to anyone with a credit card. Prosecutors in states where abortion becomes illegal will soon be able to obtain warrants for location information about anyone who has visited an abortion provider,” wrote the group, which included Sens. Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Rep. Sara Jacobs. “The FTC should investigate Apple and Google’s role in transforming online advertising into an intense system of surveillance that incentivizes and facilitates the unrestrained collection and constant sale of Americans’ personal data.”\n\nAbortion-rights protesters regroup and protest following Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP\n\nMuch has also changed in the reproductive health care landscape since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Self-managed abortions and online pharmacies that provide abortion medication are increasingly accessible options, especially for low-income people or those in rural areas or states that restrict access to in-person abortion services. The US Food and Drug Administration in December lifted a requirement for patients seeking abortion medications to pick them up in-person, instead allowing the pills to be sent by mail.\n\nAlthough a number of states, including Texas, prohibit receiving medication abortions through telehealth, that does not necessarily stop online pharmacies and services in other countries, such as the European-based Aid Access, from mailing the medications to people in those states. Web traffic to online abortion resource site Plan C — which offers information on how to find abortion medications and how to use them — increased from 500 people per day to 25,000 per day immediately after Texas banned most abortions after six weeks in September, before leveling out to about 2,500 a day, according to Elisa Wells, Plan C’s co-founder and co-director.\n\n“Most people go directly to our ‘Find Abortion Pills’ directory that we have,” Wells told CNN Business. “Disproportionately these people are from states that have laws on the books that restrict access.”\n\nVarious online behaviors could become part of investigations and court proceedings in states where helping to provide access to abortions is criminalized, including internet searches, location history, call and text logs, emails and financial records, according to Cynthia Conti-Cook, a civil rights attorney and tech fellow at the Ford Foundation. Any part of a person’s digital footprint is fair game once a device is in law enforcement’s possession, she said.\n\n“As long as abortion and abortion-seeking related conduct is what is criminalized, all of that information can be totally fair game,” Conti-Cook told CNN Business. She added that law enforcement has the forensic tools at their disposal to view virtually everything a person does on their device — but only once the device is in their possession. Unless voluntarily handed over, a phone and all its data typically cannot be accessed without a search warrant.\n\nVarious state-by-state laws governing abortion care raise novel questions about what role an abortion-seeker’s internet usage might play. “In a state like Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, if someone orders pills online, they are doing so outside of the laws of that state,” Smith said. “Because they have prohibited telemedicine and more states are passing laws prohibiting the possession of medication abortion, there is the risk of criminalization when people do not follow the laws of their state.”\n\nSome lawmakers have even put forward proposals that would effectively ban citizens from getting out-of-state abortions. Missouri state representative Elizabeth Coleman is pushing a provision that would allow citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets” a Missouri resident in getting an abortion, including out of state doctors, friends who help arrange transportation or even hosting a website that “encourages or facilitates efforts” of Missouri residents to get elective abortions. And other states could follow suit.\n\nLaw enforcement could also use so-called geofence warrants, which request from internet companies a list of devices within a certain boundary at a certain time. Such warrants are gaining popularity as a law enforcement tool for various alleged crimes — the number of geofence warrants submitted to Google by US police departments rose from 982 in 2018 to 11,554 in 2020, according to the company’s latest transparency report. (For its part, Google says that in some cases, it requests to provide less information or declines to provide such information at all.)\n\nIn at least one case, search history data has already been used to prosecute people who seek information about abortion services. In 2018, Latice Fisher was indicted by a Mississippi Grand Jury for second degree murder after an at-home pregnancy loss. While the criminal charges against Fisher were ultimately dropped, law enforcement pointed to alleged internet search results such as “buy abortion pills, mifeprisone online, misoprostol online” to argue their case. (Mifepristone and misoprostol are the two pills frequently taken together by women performing self-managed abortions.)\n\nIn anticipation of the passage of more restrictive laws, advocacy groups are promoting education on digital privacy and sharing information on how to seek reproductive health services safely online.\n\nThe Digital Defense Fund created a guide for women on how to keep digital footprints protected when seeking information on abortions. It includes tips such as opting out of personalized ads on Google and social media sites to minimize tracking, turning off location sharing and using privacy-focused browsers like DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus that do not save search data, collect personal information or allow third-party trackers.\n\nWhen seeking abortion information, the guide also recommends using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp to keep calls and messages private (these apps also offer timed auto-delete features for messages). Unlike a phone company with access to SMS text messages, the developers of such apps can’t access the content of encrypted messages, and therefore could not be compelled by a court to share them.\n\nOther privacy steps individuals seeking abortion information can take to protect their internet browsing include using anonymous browsing service Tor or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and using incognito search windows, according to the Digital Defense Fund.

The only noticeable difference is the price tag.\n\n“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.\n\nHe said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.\n\nCharles and Colvard's 1 1/3 ctw round Caydia lab grown diamond Halo engagement ring in 14K yellow gold (Price: $2,919.20) Courtesy of Charles & Colvard\n\nGoing back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.\n\n“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”\n\nTide is shifting\n\nWhy are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.\n\n“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.\n\n“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”\n\nThis makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.\n\nKay Jewelers THE LEO Legacy lab-created diamond three-stone engagement ring 1 ct tw in 14K white gold (price$2,999.99) Courtesy of Kay Jewelers\n\nThe sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.\n\nMan-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.\n\nMined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.\n\nAmong Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.\n\nSmall but growing share of the diamond market\n\nAlthough its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.\n\nCurrently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.\n\nSome major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.\n\nPandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.\n\nSignet, (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.\n\nThis engagement ring from Concierge diamonds has a 1ct lab grown diamond with 2 pink sapphires in a14K yellow gold band. (Prices start at $3,500 depending on the center diamond) Courtesy Concierge Diamonds\n\nCalling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.\n\nThe company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.\n\nFine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.\n\n“As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”\n\nLab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.\n\nThere is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.\n\nSo while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.\n\nBut the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.\n\n“As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/politics/fact-check-defund-police-ads-midterms-2022/index.html", "title": "Fact check: How three new Republican attack ads deceive on ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRepublican midterm candidates around the country are running attack ads criticizing their Democratic opponents over crime and policing. But some of their September ads have been deceptive.\n\nAn ad from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deceptively sliced and diced a quote on police funding from Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke.\n\nAn ad from Ohio Republican J.D. Vance baselessly insinuated that his Democratic opponent for the US Senate, Rep. Tim Ryan, supports defunding the police.\n\nAnd an ad from Mark Ronchetti, the Republican candidate for governor of New Mexico, discussed a frightening break-in at his home before attacking his Democratic opponent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham over crime – without mentioning that the incident occurred 10 years ago under a Republican governor.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the three ads.\n\nTexas: Greg Abbott ad slices and dices a Beto O’Rourke quote\n\nLast November, CNN fact-checked an attack ad from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that misleadingly rearranged quotes from his Democratic opponent, former congressman Beto O’Rourke.\n\nThis week, Abbott released another ad that uses some of the same sneaky editing.\n\nThe new ad shows O’Rourke appearing to say this: “I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund police forces.”\n\nBut O’Rourke never uttered that sentence.\n\nFacts First: The Abbott ad stitches together parts of two different sentences to make O’Rourke’s comment about defunding the police seem more categorical than it was.\n\nHere’s what O’Rourke actually said in a June 2020 podcast interview. The Abbott ad excluded the words in bold – attaching the words “police forces” to the word “defund” even though they were, in reality, separated by 55 other words.\n\n“I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center, to defund, you know, these line items that have overmilitarized our police, and instead invest that money in the human capital of your community, make sure that you have the services, the help, the support, the health care necessary to be well and not require police intervention. And then also in some necessary cases, completely dismantling those police forces and rebuilding them.”\n\nAbbott is entitled to criticize O’Rourke for what he actually said in 2020 about defunding particular police spending. But it’s dishonest to turn a sentence about defunding “line items that have overmilitarized the police” into a broad, unconditional sentence about defunding the police, period.\n\nAbbott’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. During the gubernatorial campaign in 2021 and 2022, O’Rourke has consistently expressed opposition to defunding the police.\n\nO’Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans said in an email this week: “As both a Congressman and an El Paso City Councilmember, Beto repeatedly voted to increase funding and resources for law enforcement. As governor, Beto will ensure that law enforcement agencies have the resources they need to address violent crime, bring justice to victims, and keep our communities safe. Beto will also invest more resources in mental health services, social workers, and addiction treatment.”\n\nOhio: J.D. Vance ad baselessly insinuates that Tim Ryan supports defunding the police\n\nAn ad released last week by Ohio Republican J.D. Vance, who is running for the US Senate, features Vance making this claim about his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan: “Streets are exploding with drugs and violence while liberals like Tim Ryan attack and defund our police.”\n\nFacts First: Vance’s claim about Ryan is misleading at best: Ryan opposes defunding the police and has not voted to defund the police.\n\nThe ad’s use of the phrase “liberals like Tim Ryan” allowed Vance to avoid directly saying that Ryan himself has defunded the police or wants to defund the police. Still, Vance’s remark certainly creates the impression that Ryan is a supporter of defunding the police. That’s just not true.\n\nRyan’s campaign said in an email that Ryan has never voted to defund the police, has never endorsed efforts to defund the police, has run ads in May, June and September expressing his opposition to defunding the police, and has helped secure extensive federal funding to support Ohio law enforcement and first responders. The Ryan campaign also noted that it is Vance, not Ryan, who has called to abolish a law enforcement agency, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as the ATF).\n\nVance campaign spokesperson Luke Schroeder said in an email that “when Tim Ryan had the chance to condemn the defund the police movement in Congress, he refused.” That moment in Congress, though, does not corroborate the ad’s insinuation that Ryan supports defunding the police.\n\nHere’s what happened. Ryan and other Democrats voted unanimously in March 2021 against a Republican motion known as a Motion to Recommit. The motion proposed to send a major policing reform bill back to the Judiciary Committee – rather than passing it immediately as Democrats planned – to express the “sense” of the House that calls to defund, disband, dismantle or abolish the police “should be condemned.”\n\nSo: Ryan rejected a motion that sought to derail the passage of policing reform legislation by getting the House to condemn calls to defund the police. That’s clearly not the same as defunding the police or even expressing support for defunding the police.\n\nVance spokesperson Schroeder also pointed to a Ryan quote from a 2019 town hall, which was played in the Vance ad itself, in which Ryan said that “the current criminal justice system is racist” and “the new Jim Crow.” As PolitiFact noted last week, Ryan never explicitly mentioned the police in these comments, and he wasn’t discussing police funding levels; he went on to talk about how a person of color is more likely to go to prison for marijuana crimes than a White person.\n\nNew Mexico: Mark Ronchetti ad attacks Democratic governor while citing incident that happened under Republican governor\n\nLast week, Mark Ronchetti, the Republican candidate for governor of New Mexico, released a dramatic ad attacking incumbent Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham over criminal justice.\n\nThe ad featured Ronchetti and his wife, Krysty, telling a frightening story about Krysty and their daughters hiding in a closet, Krysty with a gun, because someone had broken into their home in what the ad calls a home invasion. Krysty said she was relieved to see the police arrive.\n\nRonchetti said: “Not every situation ends this way. Everybody seems to have a crime story. This is one of the biggest reasons I got into politics. Because we can’t keep doing this. Governor Lujan Grisham has made it easier to be a criminal than a cop.” He continued by criticizing Lujan Grisham over specific criminal justice policies.\n\nFacts First: The Ronchetti ad left out critical context. The incident discussed by Ronchetti and his wife occurred in 2012 – during the tenure of Republican governor Susana Martinez, not the Lujan Grisham administration.\n\nLocal news outlets including KOAT Action 7 News, KRQE News 13 and the Santa Fe New Mexican reported last week that the incident happened a decade ago. Delaney Corcoran, spokesperson for the Lujan Grisham campaign, said in an email to CNN that the ad “completely distorts the truth,” both in its use of the 2012 incident and in its accusations about Lujan Grisham’s record on crime.\n\nRonchetti campaign spokesperson Ryan Sabel argued in an email that “there is nothing to fact-check here,” saying that Ronchetti was simply “sharing his family’s personal story with crime, which is a reality that most New Mexicans can unfortunately relate to,” and that Lujan Grisham “has been part of the problem for a long time.” Sabel claimed that the same month as the incident, when Lujan Grisham was serving on the county commission for the Albuquerque area, she voted against a request from the county sheriff to hire more deputies.\n\nBut as Sabel then acknowledged after CNN pointed it out, the article he provided about the commission vote actually showed that Lujan Grisham voted to hire five additional deputies that month, just not the 20 the sheriff had asked for. Corcoran of Lujan Grisham’s campaign also noted that she voted to defer, not reject, the request for the other 15 deputies, and that these other 15 ended up being approved later the same year (after Lujan Grisham had left the county commission to run for Congress). Also, the incident at the Ronchetti home happened in the jurisdiction of Albuquerque’s city police department, not the county sheriff’s department.\n\nRegardless, what happened on the county commission is a sideshow here. The ad could have easily specified that the incident at the Ronchetti home occurred 10 years ago. At very least, the omission of the date, in an ad attacking Lujan Grisham’s policies as governor, invited viewers to come to the inaccurate conclusion that it was an incident that occurred during the Lujan Grisham governorship.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/economy/small-business-gas-prices/index.html", "title": "These business owners survived Covid.

Owner Shayai Lucero says she often racks up the mileage on her Jeep and minivan making deliveries, the bulk of which are near her home but sometimes include a 150-mile round trip.\n\nNow, with record-high gas prices, Lucero says those longer trips may not be feasible any more.\n\n“I’m feeling it at the pump,” she said, noting that prices at nearby gas stations recently jumped 60 cents per gallon in just two days.\n\nShayai Lucero, owner of Earth & Sky Floral Designs in New Mexico, says she'll likely have to shrink her delivery area because of rising gas prices. Courtesy Shayai Lucero\n\nSurging gas prices are forcing Lucero and other small business owners across the US to once again pivot and reshape their operations – actions they’ve taken time and again in the past two years as they navigate a global pandemic, a period of historic inflation, and now global uncertainty.\n\nCutting out delivery altogether isn’t an option, she says, especially at a time when tribal communities such as hers have been hit hard by the pandemic and the majority of her sales have been for sympathy purposes. So instead she’ll likely shrink her delivery area.\n\n“My services are needed, and I have to keep that in mind when working with the community I live in and serve,” she said.\n\nEconomic pressures, including massive supply chain disruptions and high inflation, have left businesses feeling less optimistic – and have forced many to pass along rising costs to their customers, the National Federation of Independent Businesses said on Tuesday.\n\nThe lobbying group reported that its Small Business Optimism Index, which is based on a monthly survey of business owners fell 1.4 points to 95.7 in February. The survey also found that a net 68% of owners, seasonally adjusted, increased their prices in the past 12 months – a four-year high.\n\n“While most of the economy and some of the broad economic metrics have fully recovered, we know that a lot of small businesses have been left behind,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\n\n‘Everything is going up’\n\nKeith Garrett, a Los Angeles-based chef whose All Flavor No Grease food truck roams up and down the Golden State, has seen his business walloped by rising food prices, supply chain shortages and now shockingly high fuel prices.\n\n“I’m just even scared to put the truck on the road right now,” he said.\n\nGarrett said the pandemic and subsequent inflation forced him to raise prices by a dollar or two per taco, and about three to four bucks on quesadillas. Prices can’t go too high in the particularly competitive SoCal food business, but if gas prices continue streaking north of $6 per gallon, he said he’ll have no other choice.\n\n“Everything is going up right now,” he said.\n\nWhile he says he is used to California’s traditionally high gas prices – he’s grown to expect paying in the “shallow $90s” to fuel his truck – the latest surge has crossed a tipping point.\n\n“[It cost] $210 to fill up my food truck,” he said.\n\nIn South Florida, Mednick Landscape Co. was already reeling from lost business due to the pandemic, halving its operation to one truck from two trucks even before the supply chain woes and climbing inflation kicked in, said Alex Mednick, who started the family-owned company in 2012.\n\nAnd now the business has rising fuel prices to contend with, he said.\n\n“I just filled up my truck, it has a 32-gallon tank, and it was $130 and change,” he said. Last year, that fill-up would have cost $100, he added.\n\nThen there are the lawn mowers that require 10 gallons of gas each and the two-gallon weedeaters, all of which is making his venture even more costly, he said.\n\nIn southwest Montana, Barb Stockwell, owner of property care business Double Duty Inc., is adding a caveat to weekly service contracts: A daily flat fee of $5 if gas prices climb above $4.50 per gallon.\n\n“That’s how I’ve survived it in the past,” Stockwell said of her response to fuel price surges.\n\nSpread over 40 to 50 clients, that move helped ease some of costs for Double Duty while not being too large a burden for clients.\n\n“Our season will start May 1,” she said. “I will have that [caveat] in every contract when they go out for signing.”\n\nThe only question will be whether that flat fee might be too low, she said, noting how quickly gas prices have already risen and the uncertainty of where they’ll be in the coming months.\n\n‘Certainly going to hurt’\n\nEarth & Sky’s Lucero has been here before: She bought her business in 2008, at the height of the Great Recession and during another period of record-setting fuel prices.\n\nShe found ways then to shave costs while not compromising quality, such as using recycled glassware from thrift stores or spring cleaning efforts as vases, and looks to take similar measures now, she said. She’s taking an online course about sustainable floral designs and also is working with what flowers and plants are available and making designs based on color requests versus promising a specific bouquet or design.\n\n“When you buy a business during a recession … I think it really helped me because it taught me how to be cost-effective,” she said.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, Wolf’s Ridge Brewing co-owner Alan Szuter is keeping a close watch on how gas prices will affect his business and employees.\n\nAlan Szuter, co-owner of Wolf's Ridge Brewing in Columbus, Ohio, says the higher gas prices are \"one more straw to throw in the pile\" in addition to other supply chain issues and pandemic-related pressures.

The new offering was a hit with area residents.\n\n“This is the online shopping world, and people expect businesses to meet them where they want to be met,” he said. “It’s one thing we are definitely keeping going.”\n\nFor now, he expects to absorb the costs – and do so gladly.\n\n“This is nothing compared to what the Ukrainian people are dealing with,” he said. “I know it’s going to impact our employees, it’ll impact our customers, it’ll impact our business, but nowhere to the extent the Ukrainian people are impacted.”\n\n“If this has the desired effect to shorten or mitigate what’s happening over there, it’s a cost worth bearing,” he added.", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/china/china-russia-disinformation-campaign-ukraine-intl-dst-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its ...", "text": "Beijing (CNN) In public statements and at international summits, Chinese officials have attempted to stake out a seemingly neutral position on the war in Ukraine , neither condemning Russian actions nor ruling out the possibility Beijing could act as a mediator in a push for peace.\n\nBut while its international messaging has kept many guessing as to Beijing's true intentions, much of its domestic media coverage of Russia's invasion tells a wholly different story.\n\nThere, an alternate reality is playing out for China's 1.4 billion people, one in which the invasion is nothing more than a \"special military operation,\" according to its national broadcaster CCTV; the United States may be funding a biological weapons program in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is a victim standing up for a beleaguered Russia.\n\nTo tell that story, major state-run news media outlets -- which dominate China's highly censored media space -- have been largely echoing Russian state media stories or information from Russian officials.\n\nA CNN analysis reviewed nearly 5,000 social media posts from 14 Chinese state media outlets during the first eight days of Russia's invasion posted onto China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. The analysis found that of the more than 300 most-shared posts about the events in Ukraine -- which were each shared more than 1,000 times -- almost half, about 140, were what CNN classified as distinctly pro-Russian, often containing information attributed to a Russian official or picked up directly from Russia's state media.\n\nThe analysis, which focused on stories that got the most play on social media, may not be representative of all posts shared by state media outlets on Weibo. But it provides a snapshot of the state media-produced information that is most visible to the more than half a billion monthly users on the popular platform.\n\nIt's not clear the extent to which these posts may be explicitly the result of a coordinated propaganda campaign between the two countries, but it is consistent with an ongoing pattern in which Russian and Chinese media have amplified and reinforced their often-interchangeable talking points on issues such as the treatment of Russian dissidents, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests , the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic , or the supposed American role in fomenting \" color revolutions \" against authoritarian regimes.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping walk down the stairs as they arrive for a BRICS summit in Brasilia, Brazil in 2019.\n\nSuch mutual reinforcement has also spilled over into the extensive overseas and English-language propaganda operations that both countries have built to promote their views globally -- a route made more important with Russia's state media outlets being banned on air and online in parts of the West.\n\nIn China's top-down government-controlled media environment, all state-affiliated content is vetted and issued in accordance with government directives. That China has chosen to follow Russia's lead in deliberately mischaracterizing the war only serves to underline Beijing's closeness to Moscow -- and almost makes a mockery of China's self-proclaimed impartiality in helping to engage with Russia and bring an end to the violence.\n\nThe playbook\n\nRussian assurances that civilian sites will not be targeted -- despite extensive evidence to the contrary, descriptions of Ukrainian soldiers using \"Nazi\" tactics, and misinformation regarding the whereabouts of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are all stories that have been funneled from Russian sources into China's enclosed social media ecosystem -- where many Western news outlets are blocked -- by its state media outlets in recent days.\n\nThat dynamic was at play on Monday morning, when China's state broadcaster CCTV released a package in its morning newscast highlighting Moscow's erroneous claim that Washington had funded the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian labs. That insinuation is used to support the narrative that Ukraine -- characterized by Moscow as an American puppet state -- threatens Russia, and not the other way around.\n\nThe source? Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov, who on Sunday said Russian forces uncovered \"evidence\" of the \"hasty measures to conceal any traces of the military biological program finance(d) by the US Department of Defense,\" and referenced documents he said detailed the destruction of hazardous pathogens at these facilities on the order of the Ukrainian Health Ministry.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on \"Russia's false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine\" and noted the \"echoing\" of those \"conspiracy theories\" by Chinese officials.\n\n\"This is preposterous. It's the kind of disinformation operation we've seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,\" Psaki said, adding that the US was \"in full compliance\" with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and \"does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.\"\n\n\"Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It's a clear pattern,\" Psaki said.\n\nThe subject was also raised in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland, asked if Ukraine had biological weapons, said it has biological research facilities, which the US was concerned Russian forces may be seeking to control.\n\n\"We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces, should they approach,\" Nuland said.\n\nResidents watch a TV screen showing news about Ukraine at a shopping mall in Hangzhou, in China's eastern Zhejiang province on February 25, 2022.\n\nMinutes after the CCTV report aired, an affiliated news outlet released an online post repeating the claims from Russia's Defense Ministry and started a related hashtag on Weibo, which began trending. The hashtag was viewed more than 45 million times over a period of hours that day.\n\nThe next day, after Russia doubled down on the biological weapons claims with further statements, without evidence, CCTV released a new television segment, which was again shared by prominent state media outlets on Weibo, gaining further traction.\n\nThe story then moved into the narrative of China's officials when a state media reporter at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing asked a question about the laboratories, prompting the spokesperson to read a lengthy prepared response that repeated Russian disinformation.\n\n\"We once again urge the US to fully clarify its biological militarization activities both inside and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification,\" spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.\n\nWithin hours, at least 17 state media outlets, including CCTV, Xinhua, and the People's Daily, posted Zhao's response on Weibo, where the topic racked up more than 210 million views. A related hashtag rose to be the top trending topic on Weibo by the following afternoon.\n\nThe pattern is just one example of a playbook that enables China to cover the war through the lens of Russian rhetoric and disinformation. Other examples include stories, such as repeated false claims that Zelensky fled the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv -- sourced to a single Russian lawmaker, which were picked up and amplified by both Chinese and Russian state media outlets on their domestic and international platforms.\n\nA CNN analysis sought to understand how large a role such stories play in China's tightly controlled media ecosystem, first by combing through nearly 5,000 social media posts from the Weibo accounts of 14 of China's most influential state media outlets, focusing on the first eight days of the invasion and news about the events in Ukraine.\n\nNext, CNN analyzed which of those posts were the most highly engaged with, identifying more than 300 posts shared on Weibo more than 1,000 times. Of those more than 300 posts, an analysis found that nearly half showed Russia in a positive light -- a category CNN defined as news sourced solely from Russian officials or Russian media, content that describes Ukraine negatively, misinformation about Zelensky, or pro-Putin coverage.\n\nWhile about 140 posts showed Russia in a positive light, the analysis identified fewer than 15 posts that portrayed Ukraine positively.\n\nA look at other characterizations showed only around 90 of these posts were neutral -- for example, purely factual reports from reliable sources, news about humanitarian aid or updates on the evacuation of Chinese citizens from Ukraine.\n\nJust over a third were what CNN classified as anti-West or anti-US, for example: stories airing views that Russia was pushed to action in Ukraine by the expansion of NATO, or criticizing Western media coverage of the crisis.\n\nCNN reporters classified some posts into more than one category. A look at the distribution shows posts that depicted Russia in a positive light were more frequent than any other category.\n\nBecause CNN only studied posts with high engagement, the findings may not be representative of all posts produced by state media.\n\nIn response to CNN's request for comment, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday the country is a victim of disinformation.\n\n\"Some anti-China forces and media have fabricated too many lies, rumors and disinformation about China on issues that include the situation in Ukraine,\" it said in a statement. \"They have smeared the image of China, poisoned the media environment and misled public worldwide. Such actions are hypocritical and despicable.\"\n\nThe backdrop\n\nThe findings contrast the apparent middle line that China has tried to walk in its international diplomacy.\n\nThough Beijing has stood apart from the Western response to Russia's invasion, with its diplomats refusing to condemn the invasion, or even call it such, and decrying Western sanctions, it has also frequently repeated that \"all countries' legitimate security concerns\" should be addressed.\n\nIn a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for negotiations to bring about \"peaceful outcomes\" and stressed China's promises to contribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"There is a difference between the way China talks to the international audience and the way it talks to the domestic audience ... for the domestic audience, it's important to preserve this partnership with Russia, because that's a political priority for Xi,\" said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow and the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nHe points to the increasingly close relationship between China and Russia in recent years, a strategic partnership strengthened, in part, by shared friction with the West.\n\n\"So (China's leaders) need to shape public perceptions about this, and explain why dealing with Russia is morally justified or is the right thing to do -- and (China's media coverage) serves this purpose,\" he said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a daily media briefing in Beijing, China, March 19, 2021.\n\nA glimpse into how China may seek to control its coverage was given in the days prior to the invasion, when an internal directive that was apparently accidentally shared on social media showed Chinese state media outlet Beijing News ordered its employees not to publish news reports that were \"negative about Russia or pro-West.\" Beijing News did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMaria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University, said Russia-leaning coverage was in line with historical precedent: \"Stories that are critical of Russia or are portraying Russia in an unfavorable manner are generally censored,\" she said.\n\n\"As a result of that, it is expedient to use Russian state media sources because they're the ones portraying the (Ukraine) conflict with a more favorable eye or view from the Russian perspective,\" she said.\n\nAnother sign of this has been which voices have been allowed to thrive on China's heavily censored social media platforms in the wake of the invasion. There, pro-Russia and anti-Western, nationalistic voices have also dominated, while there has been a suppression of pro-Ukrainian or anti-war messages on platforms and across the media landscape.\n\nOne glaring example came Friday, when CCTV broadcast a speech from International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons, at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Paralympic Games, in which many parts of the speech were muffled and were not translated.\n\nThe offending context? Parsons' \"message of peace,\" in which he did not name Russia or Ukraine but said he was \"horrified at what is taking place in the world.\"\n\nThose voices from within China who have tried to speak up -- including five history professors who penned an open letter voicing their strong opposition to \"Russia's war against Ukraine\" -- have seen their posts swiftly deleted or social accounts suspended.\n\n\"We have seen alternative, critical voices -- some subtle critique or attempts to present scenes from the war zone and talk about humanity and empathy toward Ukraine -- (but) a lot of these messages have been censored,\" said Repnikova.\n\nSocial media platforms in China have taken action against extremist nationalist voices in recent weeks, with Sina Weibo \"punishing\" around 75 accounts and screening out more than 1,500 posts and video-streaming platform Douyin removing over 6,000 illegal videos, according to the state-owned Global Times. But the nationalistic voices that have dominated social media platforms fall in line with what Repnikova describes as \"a significant spike in digital nationalism, (with) the US and the West (as) the key target of this nationalistic sentiment.\"\n\nBreak the monopoly\n\nThat nationalist sentiment -- fueled by a deep distrust of the US and concern about its role as the leading global power -- are a critical part of the glue that has firmed up the Russian and Chinese relationship in recent years.\n\nIt's also filtered in the kinds of media coverage that each have shared overseas, as both Russia and China have sought to deepen their propaganda efforts, launching social media-friendly news brands in English and other languages, like China's CGTN and RT (formerly Russia Today).\n\nWhile experts say it's unclear if top media officials from the two countries are discussing news coverage at an operational level and some official coordination is more symbolic in nature, there is a growing push in recent years for alignment and content-sharing.\n\nA large Ukrainian flag with the slogan \"We Stand With Ukraine\" written on it in Chinese characters is seen on the outside wall of the Canadian Embassy on March 1, 2022 in Beijing, China.\n\nA number of content-sharing arrangements exist between Chinese and Russian media outlets, and the shared vision is clear: these outlets together can \"break the monopoly of Western media,\" as a Global Times report on a China-Russia media forum in 2015 put it.\n\nFast-forward to the crisis in Ukraine and the upside of that collaboration, for one partner anyway, is clear.\n\nIn the European Union, Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik were officially banned as of last Wednesday, with companies like Meta, parent of Facebook and Instagram, and Google's YouTube stepping in to block their content.\n\nBut, on China's channels like CGTN and Global Times, which continue to operate, those Russian talking points are still getting through.\n\nAlready this week, posts from those accounts have suggested Ukraine and the US have pro-Nazi leanings, repeated Russian misinformation on the laboratories, and cited Russia denying that it plans to overthrow the existing government in its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy", "Cnn'S Beijing Bureau"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}]}

While most Democrats are ardent defenders of abortion rights and gay rights, many party lawmakers are less vocal about decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana. It was only Thursday when President Joe Biden decided to pardon all people convicted of federal marijuana possession.\n\nI’m not really sure why it took so long. Democratic voters are overwhelmingly for marijuana legalization, and marijuana tends to be a political winner when it appears on the ballot.\n\nIt was only a decade ago when recreational marijuana wasn’t legalized anywhere. Today, you can legally light up in 19 states.\n\nThe majority of these states did it through ballot measures. Now, while it’s not surprising that voters in liberal states such as California and Massachusetts voted in favor of marijuana legalization, a number of purple or red states have done so as well.\n\nVoters in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada and South Dakota have all voted to legalize recreational marijuana. But not only that, they have tended to do so by margins that far exceed the Democratic Party’s baseline.\n\nTake the four places where voters decided to legalize marijuana in 2020: Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota. The margin of “yes” to legalization over “no” to legalization exceeded Biden’s margin in each of these states by at least 18 points.\n\nThis year, marijuana legalization is on the ballot in five states: Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota (where state courts nullified the results of the 2020 legalization ballot measure). I went through the data available for these states. It suggests the marijuana legalization measures are favored to pass at this point in Arkansas, Maryland and Missouri. The data is unclear in the Dakotas.\n\nMaryland is a deep-blue state, but Arkansas and Missouri are emphatically not. Biden lost Arkansas and Missouri by 15 points and 28 points in 2020 respectively. Even in South Dakota, it seems quite likely that, at a minimum, the legalization measure will greatly outperform Biden’s 2020 baseline.\n\nIt shouldn’t be too surprising that marijuana does well when put in front of the voters across both blue and red states. It’s an issue on which there is actually fairly large policy agreement between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nA national Gallup poll conducted late last year showed that 83% of Democrats and 50% of Republicans were for legalization of recreational marijuana. A Grinnell College poll found that 64% of Biden’s 2020 supporters and 45% of Donald Trump’s voters thought that marijuana should be “absolutely free to do”.\n\nOn an issue such as building a wall along the US-Mexico border, the partisan gap is closer to 80 points instead of 20 to 30 points as it is with marijuana.\n\nOf course, partisanship isn’t the only big divide in politics. Education and race are big divides too.\n\nBut not so on marijuana. Majorities of both college- and noncollege-educated Americans want marijuana to be legal, polling shows. Majorities of Black, White and Hispanic adults are in favor of it too.\n\nWe see this when we look at the ballot measures on marijuana. It has passed in states with a lot of people with college degrees, such as Colorado and Massachusetts. It has also been legalized via the ballot in states where far fewer voters have college degrees, such as Michigan and Nevada.\n\nLikewise, it has passed in the swing state with the highest proportion of White voters (Maine) and the lowest (Nevada). Nevada is also a state with one of the highest percentages of Hispanic residents in the country. This year, passage in a state with one of the highest proportions of Black voters (Maryland) seems all but assured, based on the polling.\n\nThe bottom line is: Supporting recreational marijuana is a political winner.

Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored a stalled New Jersey legal weed bill, said they simply couldn't find enough support in the Senate to get a marijuana legalization bill passed.\n\n\"This initiative will bring cannabis out of the underground so that it can be controlled to ensure a safe product, strictly regulated to limit use to adults and have sales subjected to the sales tax,\" Sweeney and Scutari said in a statement.\n\nIf voters legalize weed in New Jersey in November 2020, it would take effect on Jan. 1. The law would only regulate marijuana bought, sold and used for recreational purposes; it would not impact the New Jersey medical marijuana program, which underwent its own series of changes earlier this year.\n\nBut it would likely be at least months before recreational marijuana dispensaries opened, as the Cannabis Regulatory Commission would first have to set the rules and guidelines for the new cannabis industry, as well as accept applications and issue necessary weed licenses.\n\nIn other states with legal weed, recreational marijuana dispensaries have usually opened between 12 and 18 months after a ballot question was approved.\n\nNew Jersey: Home of low taxes\n\nThe biggest change in the ballot measure concerns the tax structure — or lack thereof.\n\nWhile legislators have called for levying legal weed taxes anywhere from 12% to 25% or placing a flat $42 per ounce rate, the ballot resolution specifically states that legal weed sales would only be subject to the New Jersey state sales tax.\n\nThat 6.625% tax rate would be the lowest marijuana tax in the United States, which Scutari said would help push customers away from the black market and into legal marijuana dispensaries.\n\n\"One of the things we can try to do to combat and eviscerate the black market is to have the lowest possible tax rate,\" Scutari said in an interview. \"It'll take a long time to get rid of the black market, but this will help get it done.\"\n\n[ Don't miss any of our marijuana coverage by downloading the Asbury Park Press app today.

But getting a legal weed bill through the Legislature has proved more difficult than imagined, as a number of prominent Democrats — notably members of the party's black caucus — quickly came out against it.\n\n“I am disappointed that we are not able to get this done legislatively and that our failed status quo – which sends roughly 600 people to jail a week for possession, the majority of them people of color — will continue,\" Murphy said in a statement. \"However, I have faith that the people of New Jersey will put us on the right side of history when they vote next November.\n\n\"By approving this ballot measure before the end of this legislative session, New Jersey will move one step closer to righting a historical wrong and achieving what I have spent more than three years advocating for.\"\n\nMurphy, along with social justice advocates, has argued that legalizing marijuana would put a dent in the the racial disparity among those arrested on pot charges. Despite research showing similar marijuana use rates for whites and blacks, the latter are arrested for weed at three times the rate of whites in New Jersey.\n\nLast week, an ACLU analysis of marijuana arrest data reported that one person is arrested every 14 minutes. A USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey report last year revealed that New Jersey police officers are the country's toughest enforcers of marijuana laws, with marijuana making up 10% of all arrests statewide.\n\n\"Let's Talk About Marijuana\": Join our Facebook group where readers and journalists discuss the ins and outs of New Jersey marijuana legalization, including the black market, medical marijuana and the constant debate over legal weed!\n\nWill they get it done?\n\nSocial justice advocates, such as Murphy, have long argued that passing marijuana legalization through the ballot should only be a last resort.\n\nThe marijuana ballot measure is essentially a bare-bones version of the bills that had been the subject of hours of debate and analysis by legislators, advocates and voters.\n\nA ballot measure, for example, likely would not address weed expungements or include provisions mandating inclusion of minority cannabis business owners.\n\nInstead, those details, if pursued by lawmakers, would have to be ironed out by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission — or set forth in future legislation.\n\nThe ACLU of New Jersey last week said legislation was the \"only path to end the destructive legacy of prohibition.\"\n\nMarijuana legalization was just a few votes short from becoming a reality in March. Soon after, Sweeney said legal weed would instead become a ballot issue in 2020 — as announced Monday — but walked it back over the ensuing months, saying that the Senate would \"try\" to get it done in the post-Election Day lame duck legislative session.\n\nLegislative leaders had hoped to tweak the bill to find bipartisan support, but Republicans didn't flip on what has been a traditionally liberal or moderate issue.\n\nLast week, Sen. Declan O'Scanlon, R-Monmouth, seen as a key swing vote, announced that he wouldn't support any legal weed machinations unless voters approved it first.\n\nIn a press conference pressuring legislators to support a bill to legalize weed, longtime bill sponsor Scutari said, \"we're closer than we've ever been before\" in trying to get the bill passed legislatively.\n\nHours later, Scutari, D-Union, signed onto a joint statement that said he and Sweeney \"made further attempts to generate additional support in the Senate to get this done legislatively, but we recognize that the votes just aren’t there.\n\n\"We respect the positions taken by legislators on what is an issue of conscience.\"\n\nScutari said the press conference was to pressure legislators to \"take some action, and we took action very quickly, in a couple of hours.\"\n\nMike Davis has spent the last decade covering New Jersey local news, marijuana legalization, transportation and basically whatever else is happening.

The Mint Dispensaries, for example, are prepared to expedite the construction of a new, $25 million, 100,000-square-foot growing operation in north Phoenix to keep their Guadalupe and Mesa retail sites stocked if Proposition 207 passes.\n\nThe Mint also already has approval from Mesa to expand its dispensary there as well, and can add additional registers in the Guadalupe store beyond the 21 in the store now, said Raúl Molina, a partner and senior vice president of operations.\n\n\"We think we're ready for it,\" Molina said before Election Day.\n\nCompany officials do not want to run out of marijuana for medical patients or be left with no supply for recreational customers, which has happened in other states that transitioned from medical to recreational sales.\n\nA similar measure also passed in New Jersey on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, while recreational-marijuana initiatives were leading in early results in Montana and South Dakota as well.\n\nBackers, opponents react to election\n\nAttorney Adam Trenk, director of the Cannabis Department at the Rose Law Group, said nearly all medical dispensaries are expected to apply to sell recreational marijuana.\n\n\"I can’t imagine a world where they wouldn’t because they immediately expand the demographic of people who can walk into the store from just those with (medical-marijuana) cards to anyone over the age of 21,\" Trenk said.\n\nHe also said his firm would help clients, including some through pro bono work, to expunge criminal records for marijuana-related crimes as allowed through the measure.\n\n\"We will, through community law centers, work to help those who qualify to get their records cleared,\" he said.\n\n“It is incredibly important that we swing the pendulum back in the other direction, and stop spending money and resources to prosecute nonviolent crimes like marijuana possesion and we allow people to get their lives back ....”\n\nSteve White, the CEO of Harvest Health and Recreation, a Tempe-based cannabis company with 15 stores in Arizona and locations in several other states, said recreational sales should not push out medical-marijuana patients.\n\n“There will not be disruption to service to medical patients,” he said, adding that the company expects people seeking medical relief but who don’t have a medical card to become customers, and the business will still cater to those people.\n\nHe also said the industry is better prepared than some other states that have run low on marijuana when recreational sales begin.\n\n“Our medical market is a much more mature market than a lot of others that expand into recreational sales,\" he said. \"As a result of that you will not find same level of supply chain hiccups that you do in some other states. You might see minor disruptions for a variety of reasons … . But the expectation is because of the maturity, because of the experience of the (Department of Health Services), we're not going to see the same type of supply-chain issues they see in other states.”\n\nHe said he expects the state to issue licenses for recreational sales by late March or early April, in time for April 20, a holiday of sorts celebrated by marijuana users.\n\n\"That is a holiday we celebrate and we’ll probably be celebrating differently this year,\" he said.\n\nNot everyone was celebrating.\n\nKevin Sabet, president of an anti-marijuana group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who served in the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations as a drug-policy advisor, said the initiative was bad for Arizonans.\n\n\"Moving forward, we aim to aid those at the local level in establishing rules that prohibit the industry from opening stores and conducting other activity in their communities,\" Sabet said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"As we have seen in state after state with a legal market, the overwhelming majority of communities have chosen to ban marijuana storefronts, deliveries, growing operations, and other activities. This fact alone serves as a counter to the industry’s claim that commercialization is widely supported.”\n\nWhere tax dollars would go, other provisions of measure\n\nThe proposition would add a 16% excise tax to marijuana, on top of sales tax, and the total revenue to the state and municipalities is estimated to be between $200 million and $300 million annually.\n\nMuch of that would be directed to agencies such as the Department of Health Services and law enforcement that would have to increase their workload to administer the program, while the rest would go mostly to the state's community colleges.\n\nThe campaign to pass the measure collected more than $5 million in contributions, far outspending opponents.\n\nThose opponents collected about $600,000, much of it coming from the Center for Arizona Policy, a well-known conservative group that espouses \"foundational values of life, marriage and family, and religious freedom.\"\n\nOpponents have argued that legalizing marijuana here will lead to increases in young people using the drug and more dangerous roadways, while opponents have countered that has not been the case in other states.\n\nThe number of medical-marijuana licenses in Arizona is based upon the number of traditional pharmacies, and today there are about 130 licenses, but not quite all of them are in use at an operating dispensary. Under the measure, any medical-marijuana facility that obtains a recreational sales license would have to co-locate the businesses at one address.\n\nArizona 2020 ballot: Voters guide for Nov. 3 general election\n\nThat means the total number of retail sites in the state would be about 160, including the 130 existing medical licenses, the 26 social equity licenses, and some that would be provided in rural counties that only have one or no medical-marijuana stores.\n\nThe measure says that DHS \"shall limit the strength of edible marijuana products to no more than 10 milligrams\" of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, each. Edible marijuana products sold in medical facilities today range from 2.5 milligrams of THC to 25 milligrams or more. The measure does not restrict the potency of other marijuana products.\n\nThe measure also says that DHS \"shall\" adopt rules regarding delivery, but extra provisions were added to ensure delivery is only made to people who order from a licensed facility.\n\nThe measure will prohibit delivery vehicles from carrying \"extra or unallocated marijuana\" that could be offered to customers who hadn't yet placed an order for delivery.\n\nThis is intended to prevent delivery drivers from simply selling to people on the street, according to the measure's authors.\n\nThe measure says DHS shall begin accepting applications from medical-marijuana dispensaries that want to operate as recreational facilities starting Jan. 19 and through March 9, 2021.\n\nNo more than 60 days after receiving applications the department shall issue licenses to those applicants that are in good standing with the department. With that timeline, recreational sales could begin around March 20.\n\nSimilar measure failed in 2016\n\nFour years ago, Proposition 205 asked Arizona voters to legalize cannabis for recreational use and establish licensed outlets where sales of the drug would be taxed.\n\nThe Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act would also have allowed people 21 and older in Arizona to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow it in their homes.\n\nThat initiative failed by a narrow margin, and the number of Arizonans who possess a state-issued medical-marijuana card has nearly tripled since then.\n\nReach reporter Ryan Randazzo at ryan.randazzo@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4331.

Support for legalization is rooted in changing perceptions of the drug’s potential harm, as well as the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in marijuana sales and excise tax revenue for state governments.\n\nThe growing acceptance of marijuana among Americans has also been reflected in the ballot box. Currently, eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana. The eight states are Alaska, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.\n\nMORE:Bought by a marijuana company, small California town on way to becoming pot mecca\n\nMORE:Nevada pot sales reach $32.4M in August, higher than July\n\nPro-pot initiatives passed in eight of the nine states in which they made it to the ballot in November 2016. Voters in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota approved or expanded medical marijuana laws in their states. In Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and California, voters approved recreational pot. Only Arizona’s push for full legalization failed.\n\nIn the states where it has been legalized, the new industry is contributing to the various states' economies. Marijuana Business Daily puts the number of jobs created by cannabis-related companies at between 100,000 and 150,000. New Frontier Data estimated employment within the industry may reach 300,000 by 2020.\n\nAll four states that legalized recreational marijuana in 2016 made 24/7 Wall St.’s list of the next states to legalize pot that same year.\n\nDespite widespread acceptance of the drug, only about 21% of the U.S. population live in states or districts that have legalized recreational pot. In all likelihood, the share will only grow in the coming years.\n\nThough every state to legalize pot so far has done so through ballot initiatives, going forward, states have a variety of options for making pot legal. Predicting which states will be next to legalize requires weighing a range of legal circumstances and cultural conditions. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed marijuana usage rates, existing marijuana laws, and legislative processes in each state to identify the states most likely to legalize pot next.\n\n1. Arizona\n\nPossession decriminalized: No\n\nAmount decriminalized: N/A\n\nMax. fine for less than 2 lbs.: $150,000\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.7% (19th highest)\n\nIn ballot initiative states, citizens can vote directly on proposed laws. As a result, because politicians who may fear political fallout are out of the equation, states that allow ballot initiatives are much more likely to legalize recreational marijuana use than non-ballot initiative states. Arizona voters in November 2016 struck down Proposition 205, which would have allowed adults in the state to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow and harvest up to six plants, by a 52.2% to 47.8% margin. Despite the defeat for legalization proponents, other ballot initiative states that have struck down similar propositions in the past — like neighboring California — ultimately legalized pot.\n\nCurrently, state residents with dispensary cards suffering from a range of conditions, including PTSD, severe nausea, and cancer, can legally posses as much as 2.5 ounces of marijuana for medicinal use.\n\n2. Arkansas\n\nPossession decriminalized: No\n\nAmount decriminalized: N/A\n\nMax. fine for less than 4 oz.: $2,500\n\nAnnual adult usage: 11.3% (16th lowest)\n\nAs a ballot initiative state, the likelihood of Arkansas legalizing recreational marijuana use is considerably higher than that of most other states. Voters in the state recently approved Issue 6 by a 53.2% to 46.8% margin, allowing the use of medical marijuana with doctor approval for the first time. The new law may be a sign of progress for proponents of legalization, as voters in the state struck down a similar proposition as recently as 2012.\n\nStill, the state has several potential hurdles to clear before full legalization is reality. Many voters in Arkansas may not be open to the idea of legalization, as just an estimated 11.3% of state adults 18 and older have used marijuana in the past year, a smaller share than in most states. Additionally, those caught in possession of any amount without doctor approval can face a misdemeanor, one year in jail, and a $2,500 fine.\n\n3. Connecticut\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: Less than 1/2 oz\n\nMax. fine for less than 1/2 oz: $150\n\nAnnual adult usage: 15.4% (10th highest)\n\nAs is the case in much of the country, Connecticut residents’ attitudes towards pot have shifted considerably in recent years. Some 39.1% of state adults 26 and older perceived great risk in monthly marijuana use in 2002. The share has since fallen to 28.8% of adults. Additionally, Connecticut’s medical marijuana program, which has been in effect since June 2012, was strengthened in 2016. That year, legislators added several new conditions to the list of those approved for medical marijuana, and the state’s Department of Consumer Protection greenlighted three new dispensaries. Even more recently, Democratic lawmakers in the state included a plan to tax and regulate marijuana in their 2017 budget proposal.\n\nConnecticut is one several states to have decriminalized marijuana possession. First time offenders caught with less half an ounce face no more than a $150 fine. For repeat offenders, fines can be as high as $500, but still, possession of a small amount carries no criminal charges.\n\nMore: These are the 5 worst cities for Black Americans\n\nMore: Least livable: 50 worst cities to live in\n\nMore: Most livable: America’s 50 best cities to live in\n\n4. Delaware\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 1 oz. or less\n\nMax. fine for 1 oz. or less: $100\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.7% (20th highest)\n\nDelaware may very well be the next state to legalize recreational marijuana use, and the first in the country to do so without a ballot initiative. State lawmakers have sponsored House Bill 110, which, if passed, would regulate and tax marijuana in a similar way to alcohol. The bill made it past the Revenue and Finance Committee and will be considered by the state legislature in January 2018.\n\nMarijuana legalization appears to have the support of voters in the state. A 2016 poll conducted by the University of Delaware found that 61% of state residents support legalization. Changing attitudes have been a long time in the making. In 2002, 41.4% of state residents 26 and older perceived great risk from monthly marijuana use. As of 2014, only 28.9% of state adults see monthly pot use as very risky.\n\n5. Florida\n\nPossession decriminalized: No\n\nAmount decriminalized: N/A\n\nMax. fine for 20 g. or less: $1,000\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.1% (24th lowest)\n\nSo far, every state to have legalized recreational marijuana use did so through a voter proposed ballot initiative. In November 2016, Sunshine State residents voted by a wide 71.3% to 28.7% margin to legalize medical marijuana use. Passage of the law, known as Amendment 2, means that patients suffering from a range of conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, PTSD, and glaucoma, can legally obtain and possess marijuana with a doctor’s approval.\n\nDespite the recent constitutional amendment that suggests growing acceptance of marijuana use in Florida, recreational users in the state still face serious legal consequences. Those caught with 20 grams or less of the drug face misdemeanor charges, up to a year in jail, and fines as high as $1,000. Still, as a ballot initiative state, legalization could happen much faster in Florida than in states that do not allow voter-sponsored ballot initiatives.\n\n6. Illinois\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 10 g. or less\n\nMax. fine for 10 g. or less: $200\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.3% (24th highest)\n\nFew states seem as poised to legalize recreational marijuana use as Illinois. State lawmakers are currently considering legislation in Senate Bill 316 and House Bill 2353 that would allow adults of legal drinking age in the state to possess, cultivate, and purchase limited amounts of pot. If these bills pass, marijuana sales could add to state coffers an estimated $566 million in excise tax revenue per year and as much as $133 million in sales tax revenue annually.\n\nCurrently, possession of certain amounts of marijuana for nonmedical purposes is decriminalized in Illinois. Those caught with 10 grams or less will not face more than a $200 fine. State residents with a range of conditions, including cancer, glaucoma, and Parkinson’s disease, can qualify for a medical cannabis card.\n\n7. Maryland\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: Less than 10 g.\n\nMax. fine for less than 10 g.: $100\n\nAnnual adult usage: 14.8% (15th highest)\n\nSupport for legalizing marijuana for recreational use appears to be on the rise in Maryland, from 54% of residents in 2014 to 61% in 2016, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. More importantly, 64% of likely voters support legalizing pot.\n\nThe state has already taken a more relaxed attitude toward marijuana. Maryland allows medical marijuana use, it decriminalized possession of under 10 grams, and capped the fine for having a small amount at $100. But state legislators are still hesitant to institute full legalization. A recent legalization bill fell short of passing. The state legislature will not meet again until 2018.\n\n8. Michigan\n\nPossession decriminalized: No\n\nAmount decriminalized: N/A\n\nMax. fine for any amount: $2,000\n\nAnnual adult usage: 15.0% (13th highest)\n\nSome proponents of pot legalization in Michigan are working to gather the 252,523 petition signatures necessary to include a proposal — to tax and regulate marijuana like alcohol — on the November 2018 ballot. If enough signatures are gathered, and if voters approve the measure, adults in Michigan will be able to possess up to 2.5 ounces and cultivate as many as 12 marijuana plants. If passed, Michigan would also join the ranks of a growing number of states to have legalized recreational marijuana through ballot initiatives. Voters in Michigan legalized medical marijuana for a range of conditions in 2008, also through a ballot initiative.\n\nCurrently, Michigan residents without a medical card can face a $2,000 fine and jail time for possessing small amounts of marijuana.\n\n9. Minnesota\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 42.5 g. or less\n\nMax. fine for 42.5 g. or less: $200\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.6% (21st highest)\n\nSince Minnesota does not have ballot initiatives, marijuana legalization may face more of an uphill battle there than in many other states on this list. So some pro-pot lawmakers in the state introduced bills that would have allowed Minnesota voters to decide whether to amend the constitution to include marijuana as a right. That measure failed, but attitudes towards pot are shifting in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nCurrent Gov. Mark Dayton opposes legalization, even though he is part of the often pot-friendly Democratic party. However, Dayton is not seeking reelection in 2018, and most Democratic gubernatorial candidates announced they support marijuana legalization.\n\n10. Montana\n\nPossession decriminalized: No\n\nAmount decriminalized: N/A\n\nMax. fine for 60 g, or less: $500\n\nAnnual adult usage: 15.1% (11th highest)\n\nMontana has had a long and checkered history with marijuana laws. First approved for medical use in a 2004 ballot initiative, state lawmakers voted to repeal the measure seven years later, only to be blocked by a veto from the governor. Throughout 2011, lawmakers in Montana fought to impose stricter regulations on the state’s marijuana medical program. The following year, Constitutional Initiative 110, which proposed an all out legalization, failed to garner enough signatures to make it to the ballot. A similar initiative failed to make it to the ballot box as recently as 2016. Still, that same year, Montana voters passed the Medical Marijuana Initiative which loosened some restrictions in existing medical marijuana laws.\n\nAs is the case nationwide, Montana residents seem to become more accepting of marijuana use. An estimated 36.2% of adults 26 and older in the state perceived great risk from monthly marijuana use in 2002. As of 2014, only 26.6% of the same age group saw monthly marijuana use as inherently harmful.\n\n11. New Hampshire\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 3/4 oz. or less\n\nMax. fine for 3/4 oz. or less: $100\n\nAnnual adult usage: 17.1% (9th highest)\n\nNew Hampshire is catching up with many other states heading towards legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes. The state decriminalized marijuana possession up to three quarters of an ounce in September 2017.\n\nSome 17.1% of adults in the state used marijuana in the past year, the ninth-highest share of all states. The relatively high share of pot users could be part of the reason why legalization is so popular in the Granite State. A University of New Hampshire poll found 68% of residents support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. That is more support than any single elected official in the state has.\n\n12. New York\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 25 g. or less\n\nMax. fine for 25 g. or less: $100\n\nAnnual adult usage: 15.0% (14th highest)\n\nMuch of the hopes for recreational marijuana legalization in New York actually rest with Massachusetts. Advocates believe that New York state officials could be spurred to act if legalization works well in the neighboring state, which will begin selling recreational pot in July 2018.\n\nNew York already has a medical marijuana program and a significant amount of users overall. The state is home to more than 2.3 million adults who used pot in the past year. Pot smokers caught with the drug in the Empire State have little to fear in the way of legal repercussions. First time offenders caught with 25 grams or less face a $100 fine, while second time offenders are slapped with a $200 fine.\n\n13. Ohio\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: Less than 100 g.\n\nMax. fine for less than 100 g.: $150\n\nAnnual adult usage: 12.0% (21st lowest)\n\nOhio’s attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in 2015 faltered, though the problem may not have been pot itself. Some voters were concerned the ballot initiative would have created an oligopoly, limiting pot profits to just a handful of companies sponsoring the legislation. Even the prominent pro-pot advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project did not endorse the bill. However, since voters can change state law via ballot initiatives, Ohio could be poised for another shot at legalization.\n\nOhio is in the midst of implementing its medical marijuana program. Currently, recreational users in the state caught with any amount less than 100 grams only face a $150 fine and no jail time.\n\n14. Rhode Island\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: Less than 1 oz.\n\nMax. fine for less than 1 oz.: $150\n\nAnnual adult usage: 18.7% (6th highest)\n\nRhode Island lawmakers are working to draft a bill that would legalize marijuana for personal use. They are aiming to introduce the bill in the first legislative session of 2018. If successful, the state could be the first to pass a recreational marijuana law through the state legislature, as all other states that have legalized marijuana use did so through ballot initiatives.\n\nThe bill had much support in the Rhode Island legislature, with about a third of the House of Representatives co-sponsoring the bill. Some 18.7% of Rhode Island adults used pot in the past year, more than 5 percentage points ahead of the national share of adult pot users. High usage rates can often suggest a more tolerant cultural stance towards pot.\n\n15. Vermont\n\nPossession decriminalized: Yes\n\nAmount decriminalized: 1 oz. or less\n\nMax. fine for 1 oz. or less: $200\n\nAnnual adult usage: 20.6% (3rd highest)\n\nVermont was well on its way to having the first state legislature to pass a law allowing people 21 and over to use marijuana for recreational purposes. It was only one signature away, but Gov. Phil Scott vetoed the bill, saying he wanted to further study the effects pot has on public safety and state tax revenue. Scott said he would be willing to sign a recreational pot bill into law with a few tweaks.\n\nIt is not a surprise that politicians in Vermont would be on board with marijuana legalization given how popular it is in the state. Some 15% of Vermont adults used marijuana in the past month, and more than 20% used it in the past year. Those figures were both in the top three among states.\n\nTo identify the states most likely to legalize recreational marijuana use in the coming years, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed existing marijuana laws and usage rates in every state. Only states where medical marijuana use is legal were considered.

In Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota, voters were faced with an option to legalize recreational marijuana for people 21 and older.\n\nMaryland and Missouri voters approved legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older through constitutional amendments on Tuesday. Both states' measures will also bring changes to criminal law and expunge many past marijuana possession convictions. In Missouri, for example, nonviolent offenses – with the exception of selling to minors or driving under the influence – will be expunged.\n\nArkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota voters rejected proposals for legalizing recreational use on Tuesday.\n\nColorado voters passed a ballot initiative to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms for people 21 and older. The proposal will also create \"healing centers\" regulated by the state where people can use the drug while being supervised.\n\nDC raises minimum wage for tipped workers; Nevada, Nebraska vote on wage increases\n\nNevadans voted on whether to increase the minimum wage in the state to $12 per hour. Results were too close to call as of Friday morning/. The state’s current minimum wage is between $9.50 and $10.50, depending on whether a person has health insurance.\n\nNebraska voters approved a ballot measure that will significantly increase the state's minimum wage, from $9 an hour to $15 by 2026.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., voters chose to raise the minimum wage for tipped employees to match the pay of non-tipped employees.\n\nNew Mexico voters make pre-K a universal right\n\nNew Mexican voters on Tuesday strongly approved a constitutional amendment set to increase permanent funding allocated for early childhood education, as well as K-12 education, by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWith the measure's success, Vox News reports that New Mexico will become the first state to guarantee a constitutional right to early childhood education like preschool and child care. Activists and legislators in support said they spent over 10 years working toward the ballot measure.\n\nThe amendment proposed allocating an additional 1.25% annually from the state's Land Grant Permanent Fund, which already distributes 5% annually to the New Mexico Public Education Department and 20 additional public institutions, to early childhood education and public school instruction for at-risk students.\n\nWhile the amendment has received voters' approval, it has to be approved by Congress in order to take effect. New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee economists estimated in 2021 that, if approved, using the state's Land Grant Permanent Fund, also known as the Permanent School Fund, in this way \"tapping the LGPF would potentially generate an estimated $236 million\" for education in fiscal year 2023. \"Of this, an estimated $140 million would be allocated specifically for early childhood education.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/02/midterm-elections-2018-these-states-could-soon-legalize-marijuana/1809890002/", "title": "Legal marijuana states: Election Day brings pot debate to North ...", "text": "DENVER — Legal pot is poised to spread further across the country this Election Day, with millions of voters casting ballots that could roll back marijuana prohibition in two states and expand access to medical cannabis in two others.\n\n﻿In North Dakota, voters may approve what would be the nation's most permissive recreational marijuana laws, allowing adults to grow, consume and possess as much pot as they want, without government oversight. And in Utah, the state's conservative residents are virtually guaranteed to see medical cannabis laws approved thanks to a deal struck between legalization advocates and religious leaders staunchly opposed to even alcohol and caffeine.\n\nMeanwhile, Michiganders are widely expected to approve a system to legalize, tax and regulate recreational pot, and Missourians are considering three competing measures permitting medical use.\n\nThe ballot measures come at a time when the majority of U.S. states have already embraced some form of legal pot. Nine states permit recreational marijuana use, along with the District of Columbia. And 29 states plus D.C. permit medical marijuana use by large numbers of people. Alabama and Mississippi have also allowed its use, but by only a small number of extremely sick people.\n\nMarijuana remains entirely illegal at the federal level, although 66 percent of Americans support legal recreational cannabis, according to an October poll by Gallup.\n\n\"Clearly the national momentum is on our side and we see that in national polls, but national polls don't dictate state-level results,\" said Matthew Schweich, deputy-director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. \"We still have a fight on our hands in every single state where we're trying to legalize.\"\n\nNORTH DAKOTA\n\nIn North Dakota, voters are considering Measure 3, which in addition to fully legalizing recreational marijuana, would also expunge many marijuana-related criminal records.Unlike many other legalization measures, however, Measure 3 does not create a system to tax and regulate marijuana sales. Instead it permits residents to grow unlimited amounts of marijuana and then sell it tax-free. In other states that have legalized pot, anyone growing marijuana for sale is strictly regulated, and the amount people can buy is tightly controlled.\n\nThe measure, which hews to libertarian ideals, also repeals any state laws addressing marijuana, which opponents say would permit stoned driving or smoking indoors. North Dakotans two years ago approved a medical marijuana system that only just got up and running this week, and many legalization advocates have been frustrated by what they saw as the slow pace to implementation.\n\nThe chance this measure could pass -- and some polls suggest it might -- has alarmed the state's political establishment because it would take effect in 30 days.\n\n“It’s a wide-open, no-holds-barred, no-limits on anything, no-oversight, poorly written measure,\" said Norm Robinson, campaign manager for North Dakotans Against the Legalization of Recreational Marijuana.\n\nThe measure's backers say they're comfortable the proposal's language accomplishes their goals of broad legalization with little government intervention. Defense attorneys across the state are already asking judges to postpone sentencing in marijuana-related cases, arguing their clients will get their records expunged automatically if the measure passes.\n\nUTAH\n\nUtah's marijuana debate has drawn national attention to a battle between the pro-legalization Utah Patients Coalition and the powerful Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which opposes the plan. However, a last-minute compromise brokered among the church, initiative backers and the state's political establishment has laid the groundwork for medical pot in Utah regardless of whether Prop. 2 passes. Utah has about 3 million residents.\n\n\"There's a lot of voters who support marijuana in principle but didn't want to go in opposition of the LDS church,\" Schweich said. \"The important thing about Utah is that we have made a compromise with our opponents.\"\n\nUp until a few weeks ago, Utah's measure enjoyed strong support, but that eroded as the LDS church formally opposed the plan and opponents began running highly critical radio ads warning this was a step toward full legalization.\n\nThe two sides then agreed on a more conservative compromise measure that state legislators will take up soon after the election. Under Utah law, lawmakers are free to amend or repeal voter-approved ballot measures, and Schweich said the compromise ensures something will pass regardless of the actual public vote outcome.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the state's residents are LDS members, and are taught to avoid alcohol, coffee and most kinds of tea, along with tobacco and illegal drugs. The church maintains a powerful influence over the state's government, but LDS leaders agreed to the compromise measure that bans residents from growing their own cannabis, and tries to establish a state-run medical marijuana distribution network. Smoking cannabis would remain illegal under the measure, but sick people would be able to eat marijuana-infused foods or use vape pens.\n\nSchweich said the compromise plans provide a clear path forward, even if voters reject Prop. 2: \"They're better than nothing, and they provide a path to access to patients and a path on which we can build for the future.\"\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nMichigan’s Proposal 1 enjoys strong support, according to a Detroit Free Press poll, with as much as 57 percent of voters in favor. Michigan voters legalized medical marijuana in 2008. Neighboring Canada on Oct. 17 legalized marijuana sales for adults, adding additional pressure on Michigan to follow its lead.\n\nOpponents say Michigan voters need to consider the long-term implications of their decision, and suggest the tax revenues will fall far short of funding increased drug-treatment and campaigns to keep kids from using cannabis. Proposal 1 creates a system to regulate, tax and sell marijuana to adults.\n\n\"I wonder if there would be anything left for Michigan other than a bad policy that will affect the state for decades to come,\" said Scott Greenlee, director of Healthy and Productive Michigan, a group opposing the ballot proposal.\n\nMore:Michigan's legal weed, anti-gerrymandering, voter access proposals lead big\n\n\n\nMISSOURI\n\nIn Missouri, voters are choosing between three plans: Amendment 2, Amendment 3 and Prop. C. All three would legalize growing, manufacturing, selling and consuming marijuana and marijuana products for medicinal use at the state level. Under state law, the measure that gets the most votes goes into effect, and the Constitutional amendments would trump the proposition.\n\nProp C would tax marijuana sales at 2 percent; proceeds would be split four ways to fund veterans health care, public safety, drug treatment programs and early childhood development initiatives. Amendment 2 would tax marijuana sales at 4 percent, with the resulting proceeds going to fund veterans health care programs. This is the only proposal that would allow for home-growing of marijuana.\n\nAmendment 3 would tax sales by growers to dispensaries at $9.25 per ounce for marijuana flowers and $2.75 per ounce for leaves and would tax sales by dispensaries to patients at 15 percent. The proceeds — projected to be by far the most of the three measures — would go toward setting up a research institute and efforts to cure currently incurable diseases, with money set aside to acquire land for the institute's campus and to fund transportation infrastructure, medical care, public pensions and income tax refunds.\n\nMore:Have questions about your medical marijuana votes in Missouri? Here are some answers\n\nContributing: Detroit Free Press, Springfield News-Leader", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/02"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/08/arizona-recreational-marijuana-proposition-205-election-results/92893564/", "title": "As voters reject Prop. 205, marijuana in Arizona to remain ...", "text": "Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nProp. 205 would regulate marijuana for recreational use\n\nArizona voters narrowly approved marijuana for medical use in 2010\n\nArizona's ballot measure to legalize marijuana trailed in early election results, and final unofficial tallies showed voters saying \"no\" to Proposition 205.\n\nThe race — which pitted business interests against the legal medical-marijuana industry backed by a pro-legalization group, the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project — echoed the 2010 effort to legalize medical marijuana, which narrowly prevailed. The tally of complete results was likely to take several days.\n\nRepublicans gathered at a downtown Phoenix hotel cheered the early results that showed Proposition 205 down.\n\nSome said they voted against it because they don’t want stoned drivers on Arizona roadways. Others said they thought the measure was poorly written, saying it provided contradictory language on impaired driving. Prop. 205 says driving a car, boat or other vehicle while impaired by marijuana would remain illegal. But foes of the measure point to other language in the measure that says the state could not punish someone “for an action taken while under the influence of marijuana … solely because of the presence of metabolites or components of marijuana in the person’s body or in the urine, blood, saliva, hair or other tissue or fluid of the person’s body.”\n\nOthers said they didn’t like how marijuana legalization has played out in Colorado, which legalized the drug in 2012.\n\nELECTION RESULTS: Vote tallies from top Arizona races, including Maricopa County\n\nWynona Meurer, 74, learned of Prop. 205’s early results shortly after 8 p.m. She was among those who voted against the measure.\n\n“Marijuana rots your brain,” the Tempe Republican said. “I love it. It’s a miracle of God. The Christians voted the right way on this.”\n\nMany of the No on 205 campaign staffers spent much of the night holed up in a war room crunching numbers, although top-level campaign staffers made appearances at the state GOP election night watch party.\n\nAfter the Associated Press called the race, Adam Deguire of the anti-legalization campaign, told The Arizona Republic around 1:15 a.m. that voters “saw through an initiative drafted by marijuana special-interests.”\n\nDeguire added: “The defeat of Prop. 205 helps to secure a safe and prosperous future for Arizona for many years to come. Tonight’s defeat shows Arizonans will not risk letting out-of-state interests buy the ballot box to drastically change our state.”\n\nHe said the campaign’s most effective messaging was sharing how Colorado was impacted by marijuana legalization on several fronts: public safety, youth use and public funding of education from tax revenues.\n\nBarrett Marson, a spokesman for the pro-legalization campaign, did not immediately respond to the newspaper’s request to comment. Earlier in the night, he said the campaign had a shot at closing the gap.\n\nArizona appeared to be the only state to reject recreational marijuana of the five states that were considering it at the ballot box on Tuesday.\n\nAZCENTRAL SURVEY: Take our survey about the 2016 election\n\nThe party at Crescent Ballroom for the Yes on 205 campaign waned from its estimated 250 to 300 attendees after 11 p.m. Supporters cleared out around midnight as the polls showed both campaigns within 4 percentage points of each other.\n\nOf the three large projection screens onstage, one showed running poll numbers of marijuana-related measures in other states.\n\nJason Chacon, 41, said that as polling remained close, he would be counting on younger voters to come through with their votes in support of the measure.\n\n“There’s still a chance it’s going to be decided by a few thousand votes,” he said. “Keep hope alive.”\n\nWhat is Prop. 205?\n\nProp. 205 asked Arizona voters to legalize cannabis for recreational use and establish licensed outlets where sales of the drug would be taxed, similar to the system in Colorado. Marijuana is illegal under federal law, but the Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act would allow people 21 and older in Arizona to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana, carry it, grow it in their homes and give it away.\n\nThe measure would not allow marijuana use in public, and some violations of the act would be a petty offense.\n\nWhat would happen\n\nIf Prop. 205 were to have passed, adults could have started legally possessing marijuana as soon as election results become official, according to the campaigns for and against the measure. Retail sales could have started in March 2018 and the program would have been regulated by a new Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control. Current medical-marijuana dispensaries would have gotten the first shot at a recreational pot license, which will at first be limited to 147.\n\nTax revenue from sales would first have funded regulation of the program, and excess funds would then have gone toward education and substance-abuse programs.\n\nUsing information from a federal survey on drug use, one analysis estimated 588,000 Arizonans 21 and older used marijuana in 2013. About 100,000 Arizonans are allowed to use cannabis for medical reasons.\n\nPublic attitudes have been softening nationally toward legalizing marijuana, driven in large part by young voters. Arizona was one of five U.S. states weighing ballot measures this election that would legalize recreational marijuana. Other states voted on medical marijuana, including Florida, considered a crucial state in the presidential race. Florida's marijuana measure appeared headed toward easy passage Tuesday night.\n\nTo legalize or not to legalize?\n\nArizona voters appeared to be cautious about how to move forward.\n\nThat could be due, in part, to the dueling messages and millions of dollars spent to blitz the airwaves with TV and digital ads, political experts said.\n\nThe measure started out ahead, earlier polls showed.\n\n\"Public attitudes on the subject of marijuana are moving in a pro-legalization direction ... and some of that has the character of gay marriage,\" pollster Mike O'Neil said. \"A few states do it, and then it's not so unthinkable and that's sort of what the public chorus is here.\"\n\nO'Neil said the No on Prop. 205's \"really big negative campaign\" that introduced information about how pot legalization played out in Colorado — even if the messages were false or misleading — appeared to resonate with voters.\n\nThe Yes on 205 pitch throughout the campaign was that legal marijuana would take money from the \"hands of cartels,\" benefiting the state and schools. One aspect of the nation's failed war on drugs would end, campaign officials argued, and marijuana users would no longer be run through the criminal-justice system.\n\nThe Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol spent more than $5 million to push for legalization in Arizona, largely from the marijuana and marijuana-related industry. The Marijuana Policy Project and its related foundation are the campaign's primary funder, as well as owners of various medical-marijuana dispensaries and marijuana-related businesses. On Tuesday, one medical pot dispensary was offering a free joint with a purchase for cardholders who presented \"I voted today\" stickers.\n\nThe other side, Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, warned voters of a pot-scented apocalypse that would leave employers short-handed, emergency rooms stacked with overdosed patients, and motorists injured by drugged drivers. In their TV ads, they warned that children could accidentally eat pot-infused candies, and that legalization could set kids on a path to harder drugs.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Colorado lawmakers asked the No on Prop 205 campaign to yank one of its ads, which they criticized for \"inaccurate and misleading statements\" about how that state's tax revenue was distributed to schools.\n\nMuch of the more than $5 million funding the No on 205 campaign was raised by Gov. Doug Ducey, who sees legal marijuana as a threat to public safety and a thriving economy.\n\nThe anti-marijuana campaign was largely funded by companies and business groups who think legal marijuana could lead to less-productive employees, more impaired workers and drivers, and increased youth drug use. Major backers included Discount Tire founder Bruce Halle, of Paradise Valley, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and a Chandler pharmaceutical company that touts its “capability to develop pharmaceutical cannabinoids.”\n\nTom Hamilton, 66, an independent voter from north-central Phoenix, struggled with how to vote on Prop. 205. In the end, he voted for it because he thinks it’s safer than alcohol.\n\n“Nobody dies because of marijuana,” he said, adding that thousands of people do die of alcohol.\n\nHamilton, who spends part of the year living in Durango, Colorado, said he did not like the way the No on Prop. 205 campaign portrayed the way marijuana in that state was being marketed to children, through pot-infused candies.\n\nDemocrat Riann Holsonback, 43, of Phoenix, said marijuana is so prevalent, Arizona might as well reduce the penalties for those who use it and reap the benefits of tax revenue.\n\nRepublican voter Jane Evans, 59, of Mesa, cast her early ballot for Prop. 205 partly because she thinks public schools are desperate for money.\n\n\"All the propaganda about ... Colorado was fraud,\" she said.\n\nReach the reporter at yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4712.

Georgia’s contest is also heading to a runoff on December 6 after neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican challenger Herschel Walker surpassed the 50% threshold needed to win the race outright. In the House, it could be days until a full picture emerges as votes are still being counted in states like California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. Although Republicans are inching toward a slim majority in the House, President Joe Biden called the midterm vote “a good day for democracy” and praised Democrats’ efforts to stave off resounding GOP wins. “While any seat lost is painful… Democrats had a strong night,” he said.\n\n2. Tropical Storm Nicole\n\nNicole made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane just south of Vero Beach, Florida, early this morning, packing winds of 75 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. While it has weakened to a tropical storm, Nicole is expected to lash the state with heavy rain and storm surge for the next several hours. Nicole’s colossal path has already caused power outages for nearly 110,000 customers and has prompted the closures of many schools, colleges and universities as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Additionally, some residents evacuated their homes after they were deemed unsafe and at risk of collapse due to the storm’s impact.

Marijuana\n\nBallot measures that will legalize marijuana are expected to pass in two states and fail in three others, CNN projects, as momentum has grown nationwide to push for lifting penalties once associated with cannabis. Voters in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota rejected measures that would have allowed certain amounts of cannabis possession and recreational consumption for people 21 and older. CNN projects Maryland and Missouri will approve measures to legalize recreational marijuana use. In Maryland specifically, individuals who were previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will also be able to apply for record expungement. Recreational use of marijuana is currently legal in 19 states – along with Washington, DC.\n\n5.

People at high risk of severe illness from listeria infection – such as pregnant people, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems – should not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter without first reheating it “steaming hot,” the CDC said in a statement. At least one death was reported in Maryland and 16 people have been infected, according to reports from six states.

People who experience these symptoms usually recover without treatment.\n\nPublic health officials continue to interview people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick, the CDC reported. Of the 17 people interviewed, 14 (82%) reported eating ice cream. Among 13 people who remembered details about the type of ice cream they ate, six reported eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery, the CDC said.\n\n“Products identified in this alert are part of an ongoing investigation,” the CDC said.\n\nThe CDC said Big Olaf Creamery began its recall on Friday.\n\nDr. Washington Hill, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Sarasota Memorial Hospital, recommended those that are showing symptoms to reach out to their doctor.\n\n\"Who cares? We care because in pregnant and older people and those that are immunocompromised it can cause serious disease,\" Hill said of listeria.\n\nMost pregnant women show no symptoms of listeria, but Hill said that the concern lies with the fetus. He said listeria in pregnant women can cause miscarriage still birth, pre-term labor and death of the fetus.\n\nRosie Peachey, a representative of Big Olaf Creamery who responded by email with a statement to questions, contended that, in contrast to the CDC warnings, nothing has been proven, and that the company is cooperating with the FDA.\n\n“For now it is only speculation as it is an ongoing investigation,” Peachey said. “Our brand has not been confirmed to be linked to these cases. I am not sure why only Big Olaf is being mentioned and targeted.”\n\nBig Olaf Creamery’s website calls its ice cream “A Florida Tradition Since 1982,” saying it “has been family owned and operated for 25 Years.”\n\n“All of our ice cream is handmade in batch freezers just like the good old days!” the website says. “Creamery direct delivery to most of Florida. Our primary focus is to serve ice cream parlors, senior homes, restaurants, fairs, and supermarkets with a full range of premium frozen products.\n\n“The ice cream is made at a local creamery near Sarasota’s Amish village of Pinecraft. Every tub of Big Olaf Ice Cream is hand mixed with the finest ingredients and is then churned in batch freezers by local Amish Craftsmen. The smooth, creamery consistency comes from two sources: attention to detail, and fresh, high butter fat (14%) milk.”\n\nThe site calls it “Your wholesale source for premium, handmade ice cream.”\n\nA Big Olaf franchise on Tamiami Trail in Sarasota remained open Sunday, despite warnings from the CDC.\n\nA customer, Paula Russell, who lives in Sarasota, said she didn’t know about the outbreak and didn’t care.\n\n“We come here three times a week,” Russell said. “We went to the one on Beneva, but it was too far so we started going to this one.”\n\nBut Big Olaf Siesta Key sent a statement Sunday evening stating that the business had \"voluntarily and temporarily closed, as we have chose to take aproactive stance regarding the potential issue with one of our distributors.\"\n\nSigned \"Management of Big Olaf Siesta Key, the statement went on to say: \"We are conducting a thorough disinfecting process throughout the store, have discarded all product from the distributor in question and will have a new vendor upon our opening in a few days.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate your understanding and as always we strive to maintain as the number one priority the safety of our customers and employees.\"\n\nOn its website, the CDC provided the following advice about the outbreak:\n\nWhat everyone should do\n\nConsumers who have Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream at home should throw away any remaining product.

Other people can be infected with listeria, but they rarely become seriously ill.\n\nCall your health care provider right away if you have any of these listeria symptoms: Pregnant people typically experience only fever, fatigue, and muscle aches. However, listeria infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n\nPeople who are not pregnant may experience headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, in addition to fever and muscle aches.\n\nAbout the illness\n\nOn Thursday, the Associated Press reported that one death and nearly two dozen hospitalizations were tied to a new listeria outbreak that was then of unknown origin.\n\nCDC officials said at the time nearly all the 23 people known to have been infected in the outbreak either live in Florida or traveled to the state about a month before they got sick.\n\nListeria is one of the most dangerous forms of food poisoning, and 22 of the infected people were hospitalized. One person from Illinois died and one pregnant woman lost her fetus, the CDC said.\n\nListeria symptoms usually start one to four weeks after eating contaminated food, but can start as soon as the same day.\n\nThe first cases occurred in January of this year, but have continued through June, when two of the people got sick, CDC officials said.\n\nThis report includes material from the Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/health/wendys-e-coli-outbreak/index.html", "title": "Wendy's E. coli outbreak: 84 people sickened in four states | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWendy’s restaurants have been associated with an E. coli outbreak reported in four states, with 84 people infected and 38 hospitalized, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.\n\nNo deaths have been reported.\n\nA specific food has not been confirmed as the source of the outbreak, according to the CDC, but 52 of 62 sick people reported eating sandwiches with romaine lettuce at Wendy’s restaurants in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania before getting sick.\n\nAs a precaution, Wendy’s is removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in that region, since most sick people reported eating sandwiches with romaine lettuce, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC said it is not advising that people avoid eating at Wendy’s restaurants or that people stop eating romaine lettuce.\n\nThe agency is investigating to confirm whether romaine lettuce is the source of the outbreak, and whether the lettuce used at the Wendy’s stores was served or sold at other businesses.\n\nFifty-three infections have been reported in Michigan, 23 in Ohio, six in Indiana and two in Pennsylvania.

Among those, 24 cases and six deaths were in men who have sex with men.\n\nThe CDC says the outbreak is “primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, including those living with HIV. Recent data show that about half of the cases associated with this outbreak are among Hispanic men. This outbreak is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida.”\n\nMeningococcal disease includes meningitis – infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord – and bloodstream infections. “Meningococcal disease can affect anyone and can be deadly,” the CDC said in its statement.\n\nThe bacteria is spread through sharing respiratory or throat secretions, such as saliva or spit. It normally takes close or lengthy contact, for example kissing or being close to someone who is coughing, to spread the bacteria.\n\nSymptoms include high fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea or vomiting or a dark purple rash, the CDC said. While they can first appear as flu like, they typically get worse very quickly. If someone has these symptoms, they should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nCDC is recommending that gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men get the meningococcal vaccine if they live in Florida, or talk to their health care provider if they are traveling to the state. For those who live with HIV, health officials are emphasizing the importance of routine vaccination.\n\n“Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease is the best way to prevent this serious illness, which can quickly become deadly,” said Dr. José R. Romero, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in the CDC news release. “Because of the outbreak in Florida, and the number of Pride events being held across the state in coming weeks, it’s important that gay and bisexual men who live in Florida get vaccinated, and those traveling to Florida talk to their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine.”\n\nThe vaccine is offered at doctors’ offices, pharmacies, community health centers or local health departments, the CDC said, and insurance should cover the cost for people for whom the vaccine is recommended during an outbreak. Anyone in Florida can get the vaccine at no cost at county health departments during the outbreak.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the outbreak affecting men who have sex with men is caused by serogroup C. There is also an unrelated serogroup B cluster among college and university students in one county.\n\nThe meningococcal disease outbreak update comes as the CDC has been tracking an unusual outbreak of monkeypox in countries where the disease is not endemic, including the United States.

According to the company’s website, nine other ice cream shops in Florida sell Big Olaf ice cream.\n\nThe company also delivers ice cream in Florida and to select locations in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nCDC:Florida ice cream brand tied to deadly outbreak of listeria infections\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Billman allegedly ate contaminated ice cream at Big Olaf's Pinecraft location in Sarasota on Jan. 18 on a visit to the area.\n\nAbout a week later, Billman had developed gastrointestinal symptoms and a fever of 103 degrees. Billman was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, where her daughter lives, and began treatment for a septic illness.\n\nOver the next two days, her organs started to shut down, leaving her unconscious, and died Jan. 29, leaving behind her husband Richard, three daughters, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the lawsuit states.\n\nNorovirus:118 cases of gastrointestinal illness reported at Grand Canyon, officials say\n\nThe lawsuit comes three days after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory warning consumers not to sell or eat Big Olaf ice cream and linking it to a listeria outbreak.\n\nThe company's ice cream is produced at a central location in Sarasota and then distributed to each independently-owned Big Olaf store and to other retail partners.\n\nOn Sunday, Rosie Peachey of Big Olaf Creamery said that despite the CDC's advisory, the ice cream's link to the outbreak was \"only speculation\" and that the brand was not confirmed to be linked to the cases.\n\nHow does the CDC trace outbreaks?\n\nBill Marler, the plaintiff's attorney in the lawsuit against Big Olaf Creamery, said the CDC doesn't make reports based on speculation.\n\nMarler, who has represented clients in foodborne illness cases for the past 30 years, said confirmed cases of listeria are reported to public health departments. A state lab then provides genetic fingerprinting and whole genome sequencing, and a digital picture then gets uploaded to a CDC database called PulseNet, where matches can be found.\n\n\"The CDC looks at that digital fingerprint and compares it to others to look for matches, so when this outbreak began back in January of 2021, there must have been no matches,\" Marler said. \"Over the course of time, other people got sick, and the same thing happened..\"\n\nAt that point, health officials interview survivors to try to find out where they ate, Marler said.\n\nWhile that can be tough in listeria cases, because symptoms can take between three and 70 days to appear in patients, it's easier to link cases to a single source by looking at their genetic fingerprint.\n\n\"Whole genome sequence gives you beyond a reasonable doubt – this is the kind of technology used in criminal cases, DNA sampling, that kind of stuff,\" he said. \"It's been a game changer in the food space because you know that if people have the same genetic fingerprint, you know it came from the same place.\"\n\nAre Big Olaf stores still open?\n\nOver the July 4 holiday weekend, some Big Olaf locations were closed, while others remained open even after issuance of the advisory.\n\nThe Siesta Key location is closed until further notice. Big Olaf's Pinecraft location, the one where Billman allegedly ate on Jan. 18, was closed over the weekend. A sign in the window on Sunday said the store would be closed until July 11 because of a death in the family.\n\nOn Thursday, Big Olaf Creamery-St Armands announced it would reopen, but have decided to \"temporarily discontinue\" selling Big Olaf brand ice cream.\n\nEszter Bazso, owner of Big Olaf locations in The Landings plaza and Bee Ridge Plaza, said on Facebook that it was open on the Fourth of July and on Tuesday.\n\nHow many have been ill?\n\nOn Saturday, the CDC issued a food safety alert, linking Big Olaf ice cream to a listeria outbreak, accounting for 23 illnesses, 22 hospitalizations and one death in people from ten states.\n\nThe governmental entity advised consumers to throw away any remaining Big Olaf ice cream product and to clean any areas, containers and serving utensils that may have touched it. Businesses, the CDC said on Saturday, should not serve or sell any Big Olaf ice cream products.\n\nIt also said that the company was voluntarily contacting retail locations to recommend against selling the product until further notice, although locations remained open after the advisory.\n\nListeria, according to the CDC, can cause severe illness known as invasive listeriosis when bacteria spread beyond the gut to other parts of the body.

It’s managing its share of Covid-19 cases, as well as more typical problems for this time of year, like boating accidents. But staffers have also had to care for people who are sick because of something that’s deceptively dangerous: extreme heat.\n\nHigh temperatures in the area this week are in the 90s, but when you factor in humidity, the heat index climbs as high as 104.\n\n“We’ve had people just coming in today after mowing their lawn,” Dr. Stephanie Lareau, an emergency room physician, said Tuesday. “Luckily, sports hasn’t started back yet, so we haven’t seen a lot of the youth population. We see a lot of heat-related cases when football practice starts.”\n\nOf all the natural disasters, heat is the No. 1 killer, studies show. And as temperatures continue to rise because of the climate crisis, scientists expect it to make even more people ill.\n\nHeatwaves are already happening more often. In the 1960s, Americans saw about two heatwaves a year; by the 2010s, there were six per year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHeat-related illness is the leading cause of death and disability among US high school athletes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But it can be a problem for anyone taking part in everyday activities like mowing the lawn or going for a walk.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued excessive heat advisories this week for a swath of the country stretching from the Upper Midwest to the Southeast. From Dayton to Durham, doctors have been encouraging people to stay indoors as much as possible, warnings that are complicated by the fact that half a million didn’t have power as of Tuesday because of severe storms, according to PowerOutage.US.\n\nThe heat has forced school closures in Minnesota and Milwaukee, and it shut down horse races in Kentucky and Indiana. Even UC Davis cut its graduation short after attendees made dozens of calls for medical attention because of heat exposure.\n\nWhat heat does to the body\n\nTwo of the most common heat-related conditions are heatstroke and heat exhaustion.\n\nWith heatstroke, the body can’t cool itself. Its temperature rises quickly, and its natural cooling mechanism – sweat – fails. A person’s temperature can rise to a dangerous 106 degrees or higher within just 10 or 15 minutes. This can lead to disability or even death.\n\nA person who has heatstroke may sweat profusely or not at all. They can become confused or pass out, and they could have a seizure.\n\nHeat exhaustion happens when the body losses too much water or salt through excessive sweating. That can come with symptoms like nausea, dizziness, irritability, thirst, headache and elevated body temperature.\n\nWith both conditions, emergency help is needed quickly. While waiting for assistance, bystanders can try to cool the person by moving them to the shade and giving them with water.\n\nExtreme high temperatures can also put significant strain on the heart or make breathing more difficult.\n\nThese temperatures can be linked to at least 17 causes of death, most of them related to heart and breathing issues but also including suicide, drowning and homicide.\n\nStudies have shown that exposure to extreme heat can also contribute to mental health issues, problems for pregnant women and poor birth outcomes.\n\nWho is vulnerable\n\nThe elderly, children and people with chronic diseases and mental health problems are at the highest risk of heat-related illness, along with people who take certain medicines, according to the CDC.\n\nBut people who are young and otherwise healthy aren’t immune, according to Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nHe conducted a study, published in January, that found that nationwide exposure to heat has increased the number of children who go to the ER for any reason in the summer.\n\nThese visits weren’t just on the hottest days; they were across a range of days with warmer temperatures.\n\nA child born in the world today will experience 35 times more life-threatening heat events then someone born in 1961, research shows. And that’s given the best-case scenario, with the world seeing a rise in temperatures of only 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next couple of decades – “which we ain’t doing,” Bernstein added. “This is the most conservative scenario projected.\n\n“It’s a big change in only 60 years,” he added. “That, to me, is a major problem.”\n\nExtreme heat doesn’t kill as many children as elderly people, but these “climate shocks,” as Bernstein calls them, can put added stress on a child’s life. That has a cumulative effect, and it can be just as damaging as poverty or any other stressor, contributing to significantly higher rates of substance use problems and health problems like cancer and heart disease, Bernstein said.\n\n“We need to focus on these climate shocks and buffering children, because they can pose such lifelong health threats,” he said. “It is devastating to your lifetime health potential.”\n\nIt’s not just exposure to extreme temperatures that’s a problem. Higher temperatures increase particle and ozone pollution and contribute to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths of all ages around the world, according to a study published last year.\n\n“There’s a direct linear relationship between the concentration of ozone outdoors and the temperature, and so that’s projected to be more of a problem as as our climate gets warmer,” said Dr. John Balmes, a medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. “And then, of course, those really hot, dry days in the summer are often when we have wildfires, too.”\n\nExposure to wildfire smoke, which is largely made of particle pollution, can also increase the risk of heart and breathing problems.\n\nWhat officials can do about heat-related issues\n\nSome US cities feel the brunt of heat-related problems more than others. Phoenix has more than 100 100-degree days each year, on average; it had 145 such days in 2020. The city has created the country’s first publicly funded Office of Heat Response and Mitigation to focus on problems related to high temperatures. It’s working across city government to integrate plans to manage heat-related problems from all angles.\n\nEfforts are underway to create electric vehicle infrastructure to reduce the reliance on the fossil fuel emissions that make climate change worse. The city is working with homeless initiatives to get unhoused people access to water and shelter, and the city’s created a tracking system so riders know when a certain bus is coming and don’t always have to stand outside.\n\n“There are many pieces of the pie that can help with the heat challenge,” said the program’s director, David Hondula. Having someone who is focused on the issue can get other city departments to think about how they can ease the problem. It’s a big undertaking and one that, if done right, could save lives.\n\n“We’re moving, regionally, very much in the wrong direction with heat-associated deaths, seeing a more than a 400% increase since 2014. That far outpaces anything we’d expect in terms of population growth, demographic change,” Hondula said.\n\nMiami has also added a chief heat officer to its ranks, although that office is not funded through the city. Just this month, Los Angeles’ city council voted to create a position of chief heat officer.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nTo avoid heat-related illness, there is something you can do. Lareau emphasizes the need to stay hydrated; make sure you drink water before you notice that you’re thirsty.\n\nTake periodic breaks from the heat when you have to be outside.\n\nLet yourself acclimate to high temperatures before you start running marathons or doing in any other extreme outdoor exercise.\n\nAnd wear sunscreen: People who are sunburned have less of an ability to regulate their body temperature.\n\nShe said it’s important to keep an eye not just on the temperature but on the heat index, because it takes into account humidity, and that can matter more for heat-related illness.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe also advises people to help monitor those who are very young or very old, because they’re not able to regulate their body temperature as well. When planning activities, try to keep them out of the heat, and check in on neighbors.\n\n“People often think of doing that during snowstorms, but the heat can be as dangerous for the elderly, especially if they don’t have air conditioning,” Lareau said. “So if you can offer to cut their grass or do their chores for them if you’re younger and healthier and can withstand the heat a little bit better, everyone benefits.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/11/20/fda-onion-recall-salmonella-outbreak-thanksgiving/8699595002/", "title": "FDA onion recall: FDA announces more products linked to salmonella", "text": "Getting ready to shop for Thanksgiving groceries?

All affected onions were imported from Mexico from July 1 to Aug. 31 and supplied by ProSource Produce and Keeler Family Farms, according to the CDC. The onions were distributed to wholesalers, restaurants and retail stores.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the salmonella outbreak has caused at least 183 hospitalizations across 38 states and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC.

The FDA recall includes:\n\n► Some onions (red, yellow and white) from Keeler Family Farms distributed in 25-pound and 50-pound mesh sacks marked as MVP.\n\n► Some red, yellow and white raw onions from ProSource Produce distributed in mesh sacks and cartons of various sizes under a variety of brand names, including Big Bull, Peak Fresh Produce, Sierra Madre, Markon First Crop, Markon Essentials, Rio Blue, ProSource, Rio Valley and Sysco Imperial.\n\n► Onions received in meal kits from EveryPlate and HelloFresh from July 7 through Sept. 8.\n\n► Some Green Giant Fresh whole yellow onions in 2-pound bags, 3-pound bags, and 5-pound bags; whole white onions in 2-pound bags; and whole red onions in 2-pound bags from ProSource Produce with UPC codes 60580600120-8, 60580600123-9, 60580600170-3, 60580600218-2 and 60580600248-9.\n\n► Some Pier-C Produce whole 2-pound white onions from Keeler Family Farms with the UPC code 03338360051-2.\n\n► Some Alsum Farms & Produce fresh whole yellow onions in 3-pound bags, 5-pound bags and 50-pound cartons; fresh whole white onions in 2-pound bags; and fresh whole red onions in 2-pound bags sourced from Keeler Family Farms.\n\nAre onions safe to eat?\n\nThe recalled products should be thrown out or returned, according to the FDA and CDC.\n\n“If you can’t tell where the onions are from, don’t buy or eat them,” the CDC said. “Wash surfaces and containers these onions may have touched using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.”\n\nThe onions could be contaminated with salmonella, which can cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain among healthy people. The bacteria can lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children or elderly people, and in rare circumstances can produce more severe illnesses such as infected aneurysms, endocarditis and arthritis, according to the FDA.\n\nSymptoms usually start six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria, and most people recover without treatment after four to seven days, according to the CDC.\n\n► FDA onion recall:Onions linked to salmonella outbreak in 37 states recalled for possible contamination\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter: @bailey_schulz.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/10/22/walmart-recall-aromatherapy-spray-bacteria-melioidosis/6137979001/", "title": "Walmart recall: Aromatherapy spray contains bacteria, led to 2 deaths", "text": "Walmart is recalling a limited number of bottles of aromatherapy room spray because they may contain \"a rare and dangerous bacteria and risk of serious injury and death.\"\n\nThe recall announced Friday is for 3,900 bottles of \"Better Homes and Gardens-branded- Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones\" that come in six different scents, according to a recall notice posted on the Consumer Product Safety Commission website.\n\nTwo deaths have been reported and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tested a version of the product and \"determined that it contained the dangerous bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei which causes melioidosis,\" the recall notice said.\n\n►Recalls you need to know about: Check out USA TODAY's curated database of consumer product recalls for the latest information\n\n►Onion recall 2021:Onions linked to salmonella outbreak in 37 states recalled for possible contamination\n\nThe aromatherapy room spray came in 5-ounce glass bottles and was sold at about 55 Walmart stores nationwide and online at walmart.com from February 2021 through October 2021 for about $4.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said the company will continue assisting the two federal agencies \"in their investigation and are committed to providing safe, high-quality products to our customers.\"\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that there may be a connection between this product and this rare bacteria.

Raphael Warnock nor Republican challenger Herschel Walker surpassed the 50% threshold needed to win the race outright Tuesday evening, CNN projects, forcing a runoff election set for December 6.\n\nBut what exactly does that mean? And how will the runoff election work?\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a runoff and how does it work?\n\nA runoff is an additional election used to determine the winner of a certain race when neither candidate earns the required threshold for victory – in this case, 50%.\n\nIn Georgia, runoffs are more straightforward than general elections in that the candidate with the most votes wins.\n\nGeorgia’s top elections official, Brad Raffensperger, said counties are already preparing for the December 6 election, and voters can request absentee ballots starting Wednesday through November 28 via the state’s online portal.\n\nEarly voting must begin by November 28 in all counties, but Raffensperger said his office anticipates some counties could have early voting on Saturday, November 26 or Sunday, November 27. “We are working with the counties to find out what their plans are on this front,” he said.\n\nNotably, the logistics of the 2022 runoff will be different than in years passed. The 2021 Georgia law that cut the length of runoffs from nine weeks to four means that the deadline for a new voter to register for the runoff election has already passed.\n\nWhat is at stake?\n\nPut simply, a lot.\n\nDepending on the outcome of Senate races in Arizona and Nevada, voters in Georgia could then – for the second consecutive election cycle – have the Senate majority in their hands.\n\nTop officials from the Democratic and Republican parties told CNN they intend to double down on their significant investments in Georgia, with an increasing assumption that control of the Senate could hinge on the outcome of the runoff.\n\nWhat are the candidates saying?\n\nIn brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”\n\n“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.\n\nWarnock, meanwhile, told supporters early Wednesday morning, “We’re not sure if this journey is over today, or if there’s still a little work yet to do, but here’s what we do know: We know that when they’re finished counting the votes from today’s election, that we’re going to have received more votes than my opponent.”\n\nBoth candidates are expected to speak later Wednesday, aides said, with specific plans still in flux.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/us/georgia-runoff-elections-history-reaj/index.html", "title": "Analysis: How Georgia's looming runoff election evokes America's ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAnother year, another Georgia Senate race that’s headed to a runoff election.\n\nNeither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, a former football star, crossed the 50% threshold necessary to win outright on Tuesday. In consequence, they must battle at the polls on December 6.\n\nBut like last year’s races, the upcoming contest has sparked conversations about the troubling history of the runoff system, which some states began using in the final decades of the 19th century to quash Black political power.\n\nSpeaking with CNN, Gerald Griggs, the president of the Georgia NAACP, made plain some of his concerns about the state of voting rights ahead of next month’s runoff election.\n\nIn particular, he criticized SB 202, the wide-ranging elections law Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed last year, after Democrats, propelled by Black voters, triumphed in both of the state’s US Senate runoff elections.\n\nRacial justice advocates condemned the law, saying that certain elements of it target Black voters.\n\n“(Georgia Republicans) shrunk the time for runoff campaigns (from nine weeks to four weeks). And voter registration for the runoff ended the day before the election,” Griggs explained. “These are attempts to condense the amount of time people have to vote, and thwart mobilization, especially mobilization of African American voters.”\n\nHe added, “Politicians need to speak to voters – not try to suppress them.”\n\nTo give a little bit more historical context to the runoff system, I spoke with Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, in Texas. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are the origins of runoff elections?\n\nThe origins of runoff elections go back to the 19th century, when, particularly, they were used in the South. The idea was that the South was only one party, the Democratic Party. There was no effective, competitive second party.\n\nMost of the states in the South decided that democracy among White men required having a majority to win an election. And since you didn’t have a natural two-party system that would produce a winner with 50%-plus-one of the vote, they had a first election in the Democratic primary and then a runoff if no one got 50% or more, so that the person who took office would’ve gotten a majority vote in that second election.\n\nWhen did runoff elections start getting their darker background story?\n\nAs we moved further into the Reconstruction era.\n\nIn several Southern states after the end of slavery and after Black men were allowed to vote, Black people were a majority of the electorate. There were some states where Black people were 40% or so of the electorate.\n\nSo, the White people who were in control of the legislatures used the runoff to ensure that if there were multiple candidates in the first election and a Black person ran first or even second, the White vote could consolidate in the runoff and defeat that Black candidate.\n\nWhile that didn’t happen very many times, it was the logic after the end of Reconstruction, in the final decades of the 19th century and well into the 20th century. But by the time you got into the 20th century, Black people had effectively been squeezed out of the electorate, so the runoff wasn’t required to defeat them.\n\nThe thing I think people need to recognize is that the idea of runoff elections has been around for a long time. They were fairly innocuous until after the Civil War, but then they were conceived as a device to restrict the potential of Black people to affect election outcomes.\n\nBut that was a really fairly transient period, toward the end of the 19th century, because White people excluded Black people from the electorate by the early decades of the 20th century. There wasn’t a very long time when there was the possibility of a large Black vote affecting, let alone determining, outcomes.\n\nThe runoff election was maintained into the 20th century in the one-party South as a device to ensure that even if only White people were voting, the White candidate who took office as governor or whatever the office was would’ve gotten a majority of the White vote.\n\nWhat do you make of the use of runoff elections today?\n\nIn the contemporary period – in which there’s two-party competition in the South, in which there’s a viable Democratic Party in Georgia and elsewhere and a viable Republican Party, too – often you’re going to get a majority winner since you have a viable two-party system. Sometimes there’ll be third-party candidates, and sometimes even more than three candidates. And then if the vote is very close between the candidates, as it was in this election, you could get a runoff trip you really don’t want.\n\nI think that there’s no reason for the runoff. It serves no purpose. It’s a vestige. It should simply be discarded, and we should run plurality elections.", "authors": ["Brandon Tensley"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/politics/may-24-house-primary-races/index.html", "title": "May 24 House primary races to watch | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nIt’s Election Day in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota (well, at least in the latter’s 1st Congressional District).\n\nThe Republican primaries for governor and Senate in Georgia have captured national attention, with former President Donald Trump flexing his endorsement muscle for former US Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, and for former football star Herschel Walker, who is the front-runner for the GOP Senate nomination.\n\nThe Republican primary for the open Senate seat in Alabama is likely heading to a June runoff, with none of the leading candidates expected to secure a majority of the primary vote Tuesday. In March, Trump rescinded his endorsement of US Rep. Mo Brooks in that race. The state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, is favored to win her primary in her bid for a second full term, potentially without a runoff.\n\nArkansas GOP Sen. John Boozman, who has Trump’s backing as he seeks a third term, will be hoping to avoid a runoff in Tuesday’s primary that features three challengers. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as press secretary in the Trump White House, is favored to win the Republican primary for Arkansas governor, an office her father, Mike Huckabee, held from 1996 to 2007.\n\nThere are also key US House primaries taking place Tuesday, especially in Georgia and Texas, where the top two vote-getters from the Lone Star State’s March 1 primaries face off in runoffs. There are also competitive primaries for seats seen as safe for either party, where the winners will be overwhelming favorites in November. And in Minnesota, voters in the 1st Congressional District will pick their nominees in the special election for the seat of the late Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn.\n\nHouse elections are taking place under new congressional lines that were redrawn in redistricting following the 2020 census. Republicans drew the new maps in Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas. The special election in Minnesota – which is for the term that ends in January 2023 – is taking place under the existing boundaries.\n\nHere’s a look at the House races we’re watching Tuesday:\n\nGeorgia’s 2nd District\n\nLongtime Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop is running for a 16th term representing this southwestern Georgia district that became slightly less Democratic in redistricting but still would have backed Joe Biden by 10 points. Republicans are targeting the seat this cycle, and their fundraising leader in the primary is Army veteran Jeremy Hunt, a West Point graduate who was recently recognized as an “on the radar” candidate by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Hunt is among several Black Republicans running for Congress this year in competitive seats.\n\nGeorgia’s 6th District\n\nTwo-term Democratic incumbent Lucy McBath opted to run in the neighboring 7th District after redistricting transformed her suburban Atlanta seat from one that backed Biden by 11 points to one that Trump would have won by 15 points. The winner of the nine-way Republican primary will be the favorite for the general election, but it remains to be seen if a candidate will be able to win without a runoff. Emergency room doctor and Marine veteran Rich McCormick, who narrowly lost a bid for the 7th District in 2020, and Trump-endorsed attorney Jake Evans, the former chairman of Georgia’s State Ethics Commission, are seen as the front-runners on the GOP side. Other Republicans running include former state Rep. Meagan Hanson and self-described “Maga Mom” Mallory Staples.\n\nGeorgia’s 7th District\n\nRep. Carolyn Bourdeaux was the only Democrat to flip a competitive US House seat in 2020. Biden carried her suburban Atlanta district under its current lines by 6 points, but he would have won the new version of the seat by by 26 points. McBath’s decision to run for the redrawn seat sets up an incumbent-versus-incumbent primary with Bourdeaux. McBath, who has a national profile as an advocate for gun violence prevention, raised $4.4 million through May 4, compared with $3.2 million for Bourdeaux. The presence of state Rep. Donna McLeod in the primary could mean this race heads to a runoff.\n\nGeorgia’s 10th District\n\nWith GOP Rep. Jody Hice running for Georgia secretary of state, several Republicans are looking to succeed him in this district east of Atlanta that stretches to the South Carolina border. The primary will offer a test of Trump’s endorsement power – former Democratic state Rep. Vernon Jones, who switched parties in 2021, ended his bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in February and switched to the 10th District race with Trump’s backing. But Jones has lagged in fundraising, bringing in $337,000 through May 4. Businessman Mike Collins, the son of the late Georgia GOP Rep. Mac Collins, is the fundraising leader, raising $1.1 million through May 4, including a $531,000 personal loan. This is Collins’ second bid for the seat after losing in a primary runoff to Hice in 2014. Other Republicans seeking the party nod include former state Revenue Commissioner David Curry and businessman Marc McMain, both of whom have partly self-funded their campaigns, and former US Rep. Paul Broun, who held this seat before Hice. The winner of the GOP primary would be favored for November in a seat Trump would have carried by 23 points in 2020.\n\nGeorgia’s 13th District\n\nDemocratic Rep. David Scott, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, narrowly avoided a primary runoff in 2020 against a progressive challenger, and he again faces primary challenges from his left this cycle, including from former state Sen. Vincent Fort, who is backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But Scott has held a commanding edge in the money race, raising $1.4 million through May 4, compared with $87,000 for Fort. The winner of the Democratic primary should not have much difficulty in the general election in a district in the southwestern Atlanta suburbs that Biden would have won by 59 points.\n\nGeorgia’s 14th District\n\nControversial Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene holds a significant fundraising advantage over her five primary opponents in her bid for a second term representing this northwest Georgia district. While Greene raised almost $12 million through May 4, her nearest GOP challenger, health care consultant Jennifer Strahan, brought in $392,000. Strahan has the support of some GOP outside groups, but it remains to be seen if that will be enough to overcome Greene, who has cultivated a national following and beat back a bid by voters and advocacy groups to keep her off the ballot over her alleged role in the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. On the Democratic side, Army veteran Marcus Flowers has raised more than $8 million through May 4, but the Democratic nominee is unlikely to be a factor in November in a district that would have backed Trump by 37 points in 2020.\n\nTexas 15th District\n\nDemocratic Rep. Vincente Gonzalez’s decision to run for a more Democratic-leaning neighboring seat has opened up this South Texas district, where Republicans will be hoping to consolidate their gains with Hispanic voters. Redistricting transformed the seat from one that Trump lost by 2 points in 2020 to one he would have carried by 3 points. His endorsed candidate, 2020 nominee Monica De La Cruz, won the Republican nomination in March. The Democratic primary will be decided in a Tuesday runoff between progressive activist Michelle Vallejo and Army veteran Ruben Ramirez, who also ran for the seat in 2016.\n\nTexas’ 28th District\n\nProgressive immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros forced moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar into a runoff after neither candidate crossed the 50% threshold in the March primary for this South Texas seat. The third-place finisher in that race, Tannya Benavides, has endorsed Cisneros. Cuellar made headlines in January when his home and campaign office were searched by the FBI. He has denied any wrongdoing and his attorney said last month that the congressman was not a target of the probe. The issue of abortion rights has come to the forefront of the campaign, with Cisneros attacking Cuellar’s record as the only House Democrat to vote against legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law. Cuellar maintains the support of top House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Redistricting made the district more Democratic – Biden would have carried the redrawn version by 7 points – but Republicans sense an opening after recent gains with Latino voters in South Texas. The GOP nominee will also be decided in a runoff Tuesday: Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, faces Sandra Whitten, the 2020 nominee who lost to Cuellar by 19 points.\n\nTexas 30th District\n\nLongtime Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson’s retirement has opened up this deep-blue Dallas-area seat. State Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a civil rights attorney who was recruited to run by Johnson, narrowly missed winning the primary outright in March when she finished with 48.5% of the vote. She faces Jane Hope Hamilton, a longtime Democratic aide and campaign adviser, in Tuesday’s runoff. Crockett is backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC and other progressive groups, including the Working Families Party and Our Revolution. Hamilton’s supporters include her former boss, US Rep. Marc Veasey, who represents a neighboring district, and former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk. The winner would be heavily favored in November in a seat Biden would have carried by 57 points.\n\nAlabama’s 5th District\n\nThe Republican primary for this deep-red northern Alabama seat will likely decide the successor to GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, who is running for US Senate. Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong has led the money race, raising $1.1 million through May 4, including some self-funding. Army veteran Casey Wardynski, who was an assistant Army secretary under Trump and served as superintendent of Huntsville City Schools, raised about $553,000 through May 4, which also included some self-funding. Wardynski has the endorsement of the House Freedom Fund, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus. With six candidates seeking the GOP nomination, the race could be heading for a June runoff if no one clears 50% of the vote Tuesday. Trump would have carried the district by 27 points in 2020.\n\nMinnesota’s 1st District special election\n\nA number of candidates are running in the special primary election for the southern Minnesota seat left vacant by the death of Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn. Leading GOP hopefuls for the nomination include the late congressman’s widow, Jennifer Carnahan, a former chair of the Minnesota Republican Party; state Rep. Jeremy Munson, who has the backing of the House Freedom Fund; and former state Rep. Brad Finstad, an ex-US Agriculture Department official who has benefited from spending by Defending Main Street PAC. Republicans are favored to hold the seat – Trump carried the district by 10 points in 2020. Democrats in the race include Jeff Ettinger, the former CEO of Hormel Foods, and Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.

Jody Hice, who was recruited by Trump to run in the primary.\n\nThe former president made it a personal mission to throw Raffensperger from office after the incumbent rejected Trump’s demands to find more votes to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nHice, who often repeated Trump’s \"Big Lie\" about a stolen election in Georgia and other states Biden won, jousted with Raffensperger over the election results for much of the campaign.\n\n— Phillip M.

Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nGeorgia Democrat Marcus Flowers and right-wing firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., will go toe-to-toe this fall for the House seat representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.\n\nFlowers has raised more than $8 million in his bid to unseat the polarizing Congresswoman, some of which came from out-of-state donors who just don’t like Greene. Flowers faced a small business owner, Hollie McCormack, and a former Rome city commissioner, Wendy Davis, in the district’s Democratic primary.\n\nHours before the Associated Press called the race in Flowers’ favor, he deemed himself the primary winner, writing on Twitter “on November 8th, I will unseat Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\n- Ella Lee, Associated Press\n\nIncumbent v. incumbent: Rep.

In response McBath ran in the 7th district.\n\nThe pitting of two incumbents against each other means the Democratic party will likely lose one seat in Georgia, giving Republicans an even greater chance of retaking Congress in November and stymieing President Joe Biden's agenda.\n\n--Mabinty Quarshie\n\nBrian Kemp says his win was 'built from the grassroots up'\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp took the low key approach in his victory speech, saying little about Donald Trump and David Perdue while thanking his supporters for a big triumph over both of them.\n\n\"Team Kemp has always been built from the grassroots up,\" Kemp said to cheering supporters who chanted \"four more years\" during a victory party at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta.\n\nKemp mentioned Perdue by name only once, thanking his challenger for the \"nice phone call\" he made to concede the primary and express support.\n\nThe governor did not mention Trump's name at all.\n\nInstead, Kemp spent most of his time attacking another politician: Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who will face Kemp in November after narrowly losing to him four years ago.\n\nThis time around, Kemp said Abrams is only interested in being governor so that she can run for president down the line.\n\n\"Georgia will never be on Stacey's mind,\" Kemp said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGeorgia voters cast their ballots to the right, to the right, to the right, the right, the right….\n\nGeorgia voters awaiting election results took to the dance floor Tuesday night, when the DJ played the “Cupid Shuffle” and “The Wobble.”\n\nVolunteers with the New Georgia Project, a non-partisan civic engagement group, spent Tuesday monitoring polls and helping Georgians cast their votes.

Mike Huckabee, previously held the role for a decade.\n\nSanders’ campaign has been somewhat unique; she has intentionally taken aim at the “radical left” and placed her state’s issues in the context of the country’s issues.\n\n“As I travel around the state, I keep hearing this criticism, ‘Oh, there’s that Sarah Sanders, nationalizing the race,’” she once said. “And my answer to those people is, ‘You bet I am.’ Because if you’re not paying attention to what is happening in this country, you’re missing what is going on.”\n\nSanders will face Democrat Chris Jones, who won the Democratic primary.\n\n- Ella Lee, Associated Press\n\nKen Paxton wins Texas attorney general GOP primary runoff\n\nEmbattled incumbent Ken Paxton won the Texas GOP attorney general primary runoff against Land Commissioner George P. Bush, a scion of the Bush family dynasty.\n\nPaxton defeated Bush despite the legal controversies the attorney general is facing, which include charges of securities fraud and a separate FBI investigation.\n\nThe attorney general consistently led Bush in the polls leading up to Tuesday’s runoff.\n\n– Mabinty Quarshie\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene wins primary reelection bid\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose penchant for conspiracy theories and fiery social media posts made her a far-right fan favorite, won her renomination bid to represent Georgia’s 14th Congressional District for another two years.\n\nBut the Georgia congresswoman almost didn’t get to run at all.\n\nA group of Georgia voters sought to disqualify Greene from running for office, citing her purported ties to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and calling them violation of the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause. Greene loudly disputed those charges and said during a hearing about her eligibility that she had \"no knowledge\" of any attempt to unlawfully interfere with the electoral process.\n\nThe claims were dismissed by Georgia’s secretary of state and an administrative law judge.\n\nGreene will likely face Democrat Marcus Flowers in the state’s midterm election, who is currently leading his primary.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nKemp camp hopeful GOP will unite against Abrams\n\nAs Kemp backers started to celebrate, they expressed confidence - or at least hope - that the Georgia Republicans (and Trump) would come together in the fall to defeat Abrams.\n\nMark Hamilton, 66, an Atlanta resident and a former aide to Kemp, said he and other Republicans like and respect Trump, but \"at the same time, Gov, Kemp is our governor, and we support him.\"\n\nKemp backers said they weren't sure if Trump would now endorse him, but they expect at least Perdue to work for the governor's re-election.\n\nNo one will out-work Brian Kemp, let's put it that way,\" said Terry Rogers, 68, a political consultant from Clarksville, Ga.\n\nThe Uvalde, Texas school massacre put a damper on the festivities. Erick Erickson, the conservative radio talk show host, addressed the crowd and led them in prayer for the victims of the elementary school shooting.

Brian Kemp in the general election.\n\n“I think she just needs to tell the truth about all the many ways that Brian Kemp has not served our state and our community,” said Ali.\n\nAli pointed to the Peach State’s high maternity mortality rates as one reason why Abrams will win in the gubernatorial election.\n\n“I think Brian Kemp's record speaks for itself. And Stacey Abrams ain’t gotta do nothing but point to it,” Ali said. “And Georgians will make their decision for what works best for them.”\n\n– Mabinty Quarshie\n\nParty crossing in the primary\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. – With tight primary races on the Republican side, some Democrats outside Avondale Estates City Hall said they voted in the Republican primary.\n\nAnn Kruger, a psychology professor at Georgia State University, said she voted in the GOP contest to register her opposition to the former president.\n\n“I came to vote in the party that is not my affiliation to vote against Trump-endorsed candidates,” Kruger said.\n\nGeorgia is an open primary state, meaning that people can cast a ballot in either party’s nomination contest. Typically, Kruger said she votes for Democrats.\n\nFellow Georgia State University Professor Deirdre Oakley said she also considered voting in the Republican primary despite being a Democrat. But when it came time to cast a vote, Oakley stuck with the Democratic candidate.\n\n“I just couldn’t do that when I walked in there,” Oakley said.\n\n– Caty Buchaniec and Julia Shapero, Medill News Service\n\nTrump-backed Herschel Walker, former football star, wins primary race\n\nFormer football celebrity Herschel Walker will challenge incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock to serve as one of Georgia’s two senators after winning his primary race Tuesday.\n\nWalker, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, beat out five other Republican challengers to be the state’s GOP nominee for one of its Senate seats.\n\nMore:Who is Herschel Walker? The former football star is running for Senate in Georgia as a Republican.\n\nWarnock was Georgia’s first Black Senator, and Walker is also Black. Though Georgia will have another African American Senator no matter which candidate wins, Warnock and Walker have vastly different views of what it means to be Black in America. While Warnock has been outspoken on racial issues, Walker has downplayed the effects of racism in America.\n\nThe contest between Walker and Warnock could be tight, with RealClearPolitics’ latest polling data between the pair placing Walker a half point ahead of incumbent Warnock. But claims of stalking and abuse by Walker’s past partners and other women could upend his bid for office in the coming months.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock renominated by Democrats\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock easily won his primary race in Georgia as he seeks to seize his first full term in office.\n\nThe Atlanta minister, who serves as pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, became the Peach State's first Black senator when he defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a special election runoff in 2021.\n\nWarnock is likely to face former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican, who has the support of former President Donald Trump and establishment GOP lawmakers.\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAbrams wins Democratic nomination for Georgia governor\n\nStacey Abrams will once again be the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor after sailing through the primary contest unopposed.\n\nAbrams lost the 2018 contest for governor against Republican Brian Kemp by less than 2% and refused to concede in the ensuing months, citing voter suppression.\n\nFour years later, Abrams has become a rising star in the Democratic Party nationally as a voice for voting rights. She has led massive registration drives that many have credited with making Georgia a battleground state.\n\nIn 2020, Abrams was rumored to be on the short list of President Joe Biden's potential running mates.\n\nShe was also heavily recruited to run for U.S. Senate but bypassed after citing her renewed passion to oppose election law changes being pushed in Republican-controlled state legislatures.\n\nIf elected in November, Abrams would be the Peach State’s first Black governor.\n\n– Phillip M.

So far, only Democrat Stacey Abrams’ primary bid for governor has been called in her favor. She will face either Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp or former Sen.

Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, will seek to beat back challenges from the right. In South Texas, the most conservative Democrat in the US House, Rep. Henry Cuellar, is attempting to survive a rematch against Jessica Cisneros, the progressive who nearly ousted him in the primary two years ago.\n\nThe contests will be the first test of how the restrictive new voting law enacted by Texas Republicans last year will reshape the electorate.\n\nOne important wrinkle in Texas: To win the primary, candidates don’t just have to beat their rivals but must win more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise, the top two finishers advance to a head-to-head runoff election on May 24. That threshold could play an important role in several House primaries.\n\nHere are five things to watch in Tuesday’s primaries in Texas:\n\nFirst test of restrictive voting law\n\nTexas is among the slew of Republican-dominated states that, amid former President Donald Trump’s lies about widespread voter fraud, enacted a new law that makes voting by mail more difficult and outlaws some options – such as drive-through and 24-hour early voting – that large Texas counties had used in 2020.\n\nTuesday’s primary will be the first election to take place under the restrictive new law. And operatives and activists across the nation will be watching closely to see how the law affects primary turnout.\n\nAlready, there are signs that many more votes than usual will be turned away. Large Texas counties reported unusually large numbers of rejected mail-in ballots due to confusion over the state’s new identification requirements for those ballots.\n\nThough other states with new voting laws, including Arizona, Florida and Georgia, have implemented different restrictions, many are similar to what Texas enacted, turning Tuesday into a first run that could offer a preview of what’s to come in those states’ primaries, as well.\n\nCan progressives change the narrative in South Texas?\n\nJessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney, came within a few points of ousting Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in their 2020 primary.\n\nNow, with Cuellar under investigation by the FBI, progressive groups like Justice Democrats, which recruited Cisneros to run, are increasingly optimistic about their chances to defeat the long-time incumbent and lone remaining House Democrat to consistently vote against abortion rights bills.\n\nProgressive heavyweights Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have both endorsed Cisneros, but recent ads from her campaign and its allies have focused on Cuellar’s potential legal issues. One TV spot from Cisneros splices together news reports about the FBI probe. Cuellar, meanwhile, ran an ad titled, “Don’t believe her lies,” which attacked Cisneros as insufficiently supportive of border security.\n\nVictory for Cisneros, in a district that covers a long stretch of the southern border but also extends as far north as San Antonio, would be a massive one for progressives, who were put on the back foot when Republicans, including Trump, outperformed expectations in South Texas in 2020.\n\nBig GOP race might not be settled on Tuesday\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a two-term incumbent, could be forced into a GOP primary runoff If he doesn’t win a clear majority on Tuesday night.\n\nAnd with recent polling showing him falling short of that threshold, the big question in this very expensive race is which of the three challengers is most likely to advance to a potential one-on-one contest.\n\nPaxton, Trump’s endorsed candidate, is running under a cloud of ethics concerns, including an unresolved 2015 indictment for securities fraud and more recent allegations, lodged by a group of his own (now former) top aides, that he abused his office. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing, but his primary opponents have sought to use his existing legal troubles – and the possibility of more to come – to undermine his bid for a third term.\n\nIf he doesn’t win the nomination outright, Paxton will face either Land Commissioner George P. Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman or US Rep. Louie Gohmert – all three of whom are well-funded with strong political brands across the state\n\nHeavyweight governor’s race to be teed up\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking a third term. And though he faces primary challengers – including Don Huffines, a former state senator, and Allen West, a former Florida congressman and former chairman of the Texas Republican Party – he is the heavy favorite to secure the GOP nomination.\n\nAbbott is on a collision course with Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose near-miss in the 2018 Senate race rocketed him to Democratic stardom, but who fell back to earth after a failed 2020 presidential primary run.\n\nTexas is a Republican-leaning state and economic and historical factors suggest 2022 will be a favorable year for the GOP. O’Rourke, though, argues that Abbott’s management is to blame for the widespread power outages during the 2021 winter storm in Texas and for the GOP’s focus in the state on cultural issues – including passing a law that effectively outlaws abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy\n\nHouse races to watch\n\nWhen Texas lawmakers redrew the state’s congressional districts last year, they effectively turned swing districts into a thing of the past. Battlegrounds were turned into safe seats, some for Republicans and some for Democrats.\n\nThat’s made the primaries the most intense competition for seats in the US House.\n\nRepublicans Reps. Dan Crenshaw, of Texas’ 2nd District, and Van Taylor, of the 3rd District, face challengers who argue they are insufficiently conservative and haven’t been supportive enough of Trump.\n\nIn the 8th District, where GOP Rep. Kevin Brady is retiring, establishment favorite Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL backed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, faces far-right opponent Christian Collins, who’s been supported by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and North Carolina Rep.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nState and local election officials in Michigan and other political battlegrounds are gearing up to deal with a new element in this year’s elections: a large influx of Republicans seeking to become poll workers, recruited by the Republican National Committee and other conservative organizations to play an active role in administering the midterm elections.\n\nThe development – and a recent story in Politico detailing GOP recruitment sessions and how some of these would-be poll workers cling to debunked claims about fraud in the 2020 election – have raised alarms that Republican election deniers could infiltrate official election operations and undermine the process.\n\nThe surge in interest also comes against the backdrop of efforts by former President Donald Trump’s allies, such as Steve Bannon, to carry out what he calls a “precinct committee strategy,” with the goal of installing Trump loyalists in local Republican Party positions and election posts.\n\n“It is jarring to know that there is a political party, or a cohort of a political party, that is feeding folks misinformation and will use that as motivation to potentially interfere with our elections and with citizens’ right to vote,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, told Fredreka in a recent interview.\n\nBenson, who said she has been following the uptick in GOP poll worker applications for weeks as part of her regular discussions with local election officials, met Monday with the state attorney general’s office, the Michigan State Police and local officials to discuss, among other topics, how to protect against election interference, her aides said.\n\n‘Seat at the same table’\n\nRNC officials say their recruitment drive has a straightforward goal: correcting a longstanding party imbalance in who serves in these roles. At Detroit’s TCF Center in 2020, where election workers in the heavily Democratic city counted absentee ballots, Republicans made up 170 of the more than 5,400 poll workers, the RNC said.\n\n“We are only trying to get a seat at the same table,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a tweet.\n\nFor decades, the RNC also was shut out from so-called “ballot security” work under a federal consent decree after the national party targeted Black and Latino voters in New Jersey. The party’s operation – carried out during a 1981 gubernatorial election – included posting armed, off-duty law enforcement officers at polling places in heavily minority communities. The consent decree ended in 2018.\n\nGOP officials say they are now free to lead a multimillion-dollar electioneering effort that includes adding 16 state “election integrity” directors and 26 in-state lawyers, along with recruiting more than 14,000 poll workers and adding upwards of 10,000 poll watchers across the country.\n\nRNC communications director Danielle Alvarez said the party is scrupulously complying with state laws.\n\n“We were in a consent decree for 40 years,” she said. “We’re doing everything well above the law because we never want to be in that position again.”\n\n(A note about the distinction between workers and watchers: Poll workers are temporary employees of local election offices who receive their training and pay from those officials. Poll watchers, by contrast, are generally partisan volunteers deployed by political parties, candidates and third-party groups to “watch” or observe what’s happening at polling places. Their primary function is to help ensure their party or candidate has a fair shot of winning the election.)\n\n‘They will find there is no fraud’\n\nLocal election clerks interviewed by CNN say they stand ready to vet the new wave of GOP poll workers and deal with any challenges. But some said they weren’t overly concerned about the surge in applications and did not want voters to become unnecessarily alarmed.\n\nIn the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, more than 800 Republicans have applied for poll worker positions, said Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey. “We’ve never had as many Republican applicants,” she said. “Good for them. I hope it’s for the right and good reasons.”\n\nIn Southfield, another Democratic stronghold, the state’s GOP “election integrity” director last month forwarded the names of 76 potential poll workers to local election officials, the city clerk Sherikia Hawkins told Fredreka this week.\n\nSo far, three have formally applied to work the polls for Michigan’s August 2 primaries, Hawkins said.\n\nAnd in Canton, west of Detroit, Township Clerk Michael Siegrist said he has received applications for 11 new Republican poll workers through the GOP.\n\n“I don’t see anything here that makes me nervous,” Seigrist, a Democrat, said about the new applications.\n\nPoll workers are hired and trained by the township and take an oath “to faithfully discharge their duties,” Seigrist said. Anyone fails to do so or interferes with voting would be asked to leave a polling place, he added.\n\n“What they will find is that there is no fraud,” he said. “And they will see the boring, mundane bureaucracy of what it means to run an election.”\n\nDemocratic-led states move to expand and protect voter access\n\nIn the last week, two states – New York and Colorado – have moved to create new voter and election official protections – a departure efforts in mostly GOP-led states to limit access to the ballot box in the name of preventing fraud.\n\nLast week, in New York, the state Senate passed its own Voting Rights Act, which among other protections, would require local governments with a history of discrimination against minority voters to first get approval before making voting changes that might harm voters of color.\n\nThe bill, named after the late civil rights icon and congressman John Lewis, next heads to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk for approval. The Democrat is expected to sign the legislation into law.\n\nThe state Senate also passed other measures that create new criminal penalties for voter suppression, interference and deception. Separately, senators approved other election protection measures that would create new criminal penalties for voter suppression, interference and deception. Those bills still need to pass the state Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, in Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday signed into law two pieces of legislation aimed at protecting the state’s election processes from outside and insider threats. The Election Official Protection Act adds new criminal penalties for threatening or intimidating election officials.\n\nThe other legislation, known as The Colorado Election Security Act, would make it a felony for an authorized person to knowingly publish or cause to publish confidential information relating to a voting system. The legislation also requires election officials and workers to complete training and makes it a felony to tamper with voting equipment “before, during, or after any election.”\n\nThe new law follows the grand jury indictment earlier this year of Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters that stemmed from an election security breach investigation by local authorities.\n\nPrimary voters in seven states head to the polls\n\nOn Tuesday, seven states hold elections: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.\n\nCalifornia hosts some of the most interesting contests, including the special election runoff for former Rep. Devin Nunes’ seat to represent California’s 22nd Congressional District. Nunes resigned in January to head the Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nStaunch Republican Connie Conway and progressive Democrat Lourin Hubbard are facing off in the election to replace Nunes.\n\nWhoever wins on Tuesday probably will only serve a few months as the current district was sliced up amid the redistricting process and will cease to exist in its current form when the new Congress is sworn in next year.\n\nRead more about this race from CNN’s Maeve Reston here.\n\nIn Los Angeles, meanwhile, voters will elect a new mayor to replace term-limited Eric Garcetti. The contest features Democrat Rep. Karen Bass and real-estate developer Rick Caruso, a former Republican turned Democrat. The LA mayor’s race is a non-partisan election in which a candidate can win outright on Tuesday by winning a majority of the vote. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, then the top two vote-getters will advance to November’s general election.\n\nIn San Francisco, voters will decide whether to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who has faced criticism amid rising crime and homelessness in the city. If a majority of voters support the recall, San Francisco Mayor London Breed would appoint an interim district attorney.\n\nMontana also will hold a primary for its newly designated 1st Congressional District. The district is located in the western part of the state and marks the first time in 30 years Montana has had two congressional seats.\n\nRyan Zinke, former Interior secretary under Trump and Montana’s one-time at-large member in the US House, is among the candidates for the GOP nomination in this heavily Republican state.\n\nThe first polls close in New Jersey, Mississippi and parts of South Dakota at 8 p.m. ET and the last in California at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nYou need to read\n\nThis New York Times story about how the US Supreme Court could weigh in on a legal theory that has the potential to upend how our elections are conducted.

Kelly Loeffler.\n\nThe pair of Democratic wins in Georgia mean a 50-50 split in the Senate, effectively giving Democrats control of the chamber since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to cast tie-breaking votes.\n\nOssoff, at 33, will be the youngest member of the Senate when he is sworn into office.\n\nOssoff, a CEO of a London-based investigative documentary company, entered the national political scene four years ago when he narrowly lost a special election in Georgia 6th Congressional District in a race that drew national attention, making it the most expensive House election at the time. Perdue, 71, was first elected to the senate in 2014. Prior to being elected to Congress, Perdue was a businessman who worked for companies like Reebok, PillowTex, a North Carolina textile company and Dollar General.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nRepublicans: Trump rhetoric wasn't helpful\n\nThe Associated Press called the Georgia Senate runoff for Democrat Raphael Warnock, and as Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler trails Democrat Jon Ossoff, some Republican lawmakers faulted President Donald Trump’s rhetoric for the results of the races.\n\nThe second-ranking Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters Trump’s rhetoric was “not helpful.”\n\nThe “mixed messages” about the November presidential election being rigged while encouraging voters to come out for the Senate runoffs meant “you had a lot of voters who were confused about whether or not their vote was going to matter,\" Thune said.\n\n“It turns out that telling the voters that the election is rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he didn’t think Trump’s rhetoric was “very helpful,” noting how turnout for Perdue seemed lower than it had been in November, when Perdue had outperformed the president in some areas.\n\nAnd Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters Trump’s influence in the races was a “two-edged sword,” noting he had helped in some ways, but other “distractions” meant the campaigns couldn’t run with as clear of a message as he would have preferred.\n\nBut another lawmaker, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he would not fault Trump alone.\n\n\"I just think the whole environment was toxic, and I'm sorry to see it turned out the way it did. But when you run for office for your job, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,” he said.\n\nTrump has railed against the results of the November election despite states’ certification of their results, alleging without evidence massive voter fraud against him.\n\nCongress is set to meet to count electoral votes Wednesday.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nGeorgia election official says Ossoff is on pace to win, avoid runoff\n\nA top Georgia election official said Democrat Jon Ossoff, who leads Republican David Perdue, is on pace to win by a great enough margin to avoid a recount as the state looks to finish counting most outstanding absentee ballots by 1 p.m. EST Wednesday.\n\nGabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, said more than 60,470 absentee ballots remain uncounted, mostly in Democratic-leaning counties in the metro Atlanta area.\n\n“It makes it look like Jon Ossoff will likely have a margin outside of the half a percent (threshold) to avoid a recount,” Sterling said. “And obviously, Rev. Warnock is ahead of him right now. So, if Ossoff avoids that recount so does Rev. Warnock.”\n\nUnder Georgia law, a recount can be requseted by a campaign when an election is decided by less than 0.5 percentage points.\n\nOssoff leads Perdue by 17,567 votes in a race the Associated Press says is still too early to call. Ossoff's current lead is 0.4 percentage points. Raphael Warnock, who leads Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by more than 54,729 votes, is the projected winner in his race. He leads Loeffler by 1.24 percentage points.\n\nSterling said the Georgia secretary of state’s office requested all counties get their ballots tallied by 1 p.m., and he believes most will be able to do so. The bulk of uncounted absentee ballots are those that arrived on Election Day, he said.\n\n“No evidence of any irregularities,” Sterling said when asked whether the election has seen any voter fraud. “The biggest thing we’ve seen is from the president’s fertile mind of finding fraud where none exists.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden calls Schumer ‘majority leader,' says Georgia delivered ‘resounding message’\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden congratulated Democrat Raphael Warnock on “his groundbreaking win” and said he’s hopeful Democrat Jon Ossoff will also be victorious in the Georgia Senate runoffs.\n\nBiden also appeared to acknowledge what Democrats hope will be their new majority in Senate by calling current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the new “majority leader.”\n\nIn his first statement on what appears to be a Democratic sweep in Georgia’s two Senate runoff elections, Biden Wednesday credited progressive activist Stacey Abrams and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, calling them “twin powers” who “laid the difficult groundwork necessary to encourage turnout and protect the vote over these last years.”\n\n“Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now,” Biden said in a statement. “On COVID-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. They want us to move, but move together.”\n\nWarnock, who leads Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by more than 54,000 votes, is the projected winner in his race. Ossoff leads Republican David Perdue by 17,025.\n\nBiden vowed to try to work with both parties “to get big things done for our nation.”\n\nHe called for “urgent action” on an additional federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, reiterating his position that the COVID-19 relief bill that passed Congress in December was “just a down payment.”\n\nBiden also said he hopes to work with congressional leadership to move ahead quickly with approval of his Cabinet nominations after his Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\n“My nominees for critical national security positions at State, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security have bipartisan support and have been confirmed by the Senate before,” he said. “They need to be in their jobs as soon as possible after January 20th.”\n\nBiden added: “After the past four years, after the election, and after today’s election certification proceedings on the Hill, it’s time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity. I am more optimistic than I ever have been that we can deliver both.”\n\nSchumer said in a Wednesday press conference he had talked to Biden Wedmorning.\n\nWith Democratic control of the Senate, \"the ability of Joe Biden to move nominations forward will be easier,\" he said, adding that one of Senate Democrats' first priorities would be on passing $2,000 stimulus checks.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nOssoff-Perdue race too close to call\n\nThe Senate runoff race in Georgia between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue is too early to call.\n\nAt 9:45 a.m. EST, Ossoff led by 17,025 votes out of nearly 4.4 million counted, a margin of less than 0.4 percentage points.\n\nThere were still some mail ballots and in-person early votes left to be counted statewide, the majority of which are in Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nUnder Georgia law, a trailing candidate may request a recount when the margin of an election is less than or equal to 0.5 percentage points. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system implementation manager, said at a Wednesday morning news conference Ossoff \"will likely have a margin outside the half a percent to avoid a recount.\"\n\n– Associated Press\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff declares victory in Georgia Senate runoff election\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff declared victory over Georgia Republican David Perdue in a Wednesday morning speech to supporters in Atlanta, calling for unity to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. No major news outlet has projected a win for the Democrat yet.\n\n“It is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve you in the United States Senate,\" Ossoff said.\n\nRaphael Warnock is the projected winner in Georgia's other Senate runoff race last night, meaning that if Ossoff's win becomes official, Democrats will begin President-elect Biden’s administration with control of both the House and Senate.\n\nOssoff currently leads Perdue by about 16,000 votes.\n\nPerdue has not conceded the race. In a statement released last night, the campaign said they believed Perdue would still be victorious in the end.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nWarnock wins Georgia race, Ossoff ahead\n\nDemocrats appear on the brink of taking control of the U.S. Senate with Raphael Warnock the projected winner over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Jon Ossoff leading Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia’s two Senate runoff elections.\n\nAround 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, the Associated Press projected Warnock the winner over Loeffler after the Atlanta pastor built his statewide lead to more than 46,500 votes.\n\nWarnock made history with his election win, becoming the first Black Democrat elected as a U.S. senator from a state in the South and only the 11th Black senator in the history of the nation. He becomes the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate race in Georgia in 20 years.\n\n“To everyone out there struggling today, whether you voted for me or not, know this,” Warnock said as he declared victory in a video from his home. “I hear you, I see you, and every day I'm in the United States Senate, I will fight for you. I will fight for your family.\"\n\nMore:Closer look: How Trump dominated phone call pressuring Georgia election officials\n\nTrailing much of the night, Ossoff surged ahead of Perdue by more than 8,500 votes after batches of votes from Democrat-heavy DeKalb County were released. Most uncounted votes remain in Democratic strongholds in the metro Atlanta area.\n\n“When all the votes are counted we fully expect that Jon Ossoff will have won this election to represent Georgia in the United States Senate,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster said in a statement. “The outstanding vote is squarely in parts of the state where Jon’s performance has been dominant.\"\n\nThe Perdue campaign was not ready to concede.\n\nIn a statement, the Perdue campaign said the race -- as they expected – is “an exceptionally close election that will require time and transparency to be certain the results are fair and accurate and the voices of Georgians are heard.\n\n“We will mobilize every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted. We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious.”\n\nGabriel Sterling, Georgia voting system implementation manager, said he expects most ballots to be counted by Wednesday but for final counts not until Friday.\n\nMore:Did Trump break the law? President's call to Georgia's Raffensperger spurs demand for criminal investigation\n\nWarnock’s victory gives Democrats 49 seats in the Senate, one shy of creating a 50-50 tie with Republicans, which would effectively give Democrats control because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. A win for Ossoff would give Democrats their coveted 50th seat.\n\nThe possible Senate sweep in Georgia would give Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 2014 and boost President-elect Joe Biden’s ability to carry out his early legislative agenda. In November, Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes, becoming the first Democrat to carry the state for president since 1992.\n\nTuesday’s election was a rare double run-off. Ossoff and Warnock ran against Perdue and Loeffler in the Nov. 3 general election, but no candidate in that race passed the 50% threshold under state law to win the Senate seats outright, forcing Tuesday's runoffs.\n\nThe two Democrats benefited Tuesday from higher turnout in heavily Democratic counties in the Atlanta area. In several cases, they outperformed Biden’s margins of victory in these counties.\n\nLeading up to the election, President Donald Trump leveled a barrage of unfounded allegations about his election loss in Georgia. With Trump calling his election outcome rigged, some Republicans feared it might discourage their voters to turnout in the runoff elections. Trump was in Georgia to campaign for the Republican candidates as recently as Monday night.\n\nGeorgia election officials said turnout Tuesday shattered the previous record for a run-off in the state, including more than 3 million who voted early. Nearly $500 million was spent on campaign ads since Nov. 4, indicative of the significance both parties and special interests placed on the race.\n\nFollowing the playbook that helped Republicans retain control of the Senate after the general election, Loeffler and Perdue attacked their opponents as \"radical socialists\" and said the fate of nation was at stake with the race.\n\nOssoff and Warnock slammed Loeffler and Perdue for being part of a Republican-controlled Senate that for months refused to pass additional federal coronavirus relief.\n\nBiden campaigned for Ossoff and Warnock just a day before the election, arguing in the last throes of the election that their win would benefit residents in the form of $2,000 direct relief checks to help deal with COVID-19’s economic impact.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/06/election-results-updates-biden-trump-georgia-pennsylvania-nevada/6183784002/", "title": "Election results update: Biden says he has a 'clear majority' in ...", "text": "We're days past Election Day and USA TODAY'S coverage of the 2020 election continues as states work to finish counting the ballots.\n\nAll eyes on are the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election.

Georgia’s secretary of state has already announced a recount.\n\nBiden also leads Arizona, which has been called in his favor, by 29,861 votes. But Trump has hoped to reclaim that state.\n\n“As slow as it goes, it can be numbing,” Biden said.\n\nHis comments echoed a brief statement he gave Thursday at The Queen theater urging patience in waiting for voting to be completed.\n\n“We have to remain calm, patient, as we count all the votes,” Biden said.\n\nMore:Joe Biden stresses every vote must count and asks for 'a little patience'\n\nBiden said he is beginning to act without waiting for the vote to be completed. He and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, met with health officials on Thursday to plan how to deal better with the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden said they also heard about how the recovery is slowing because of the pandemic.\n\n“We’re going to work on day one to put our plan into action,” Biden said. “We don’t have any more time to waste on partisan warfare.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nUnprecedented double runoff: None of Georgia's candidates receive 50% of votes\n\nGeorgia Sen. David Perdue is headed to a runoff election in January against Democrat Jon Ossoff, potentially leaving the Senate majority undecided until January.\n\nAfter counting votes and tallying absentee ballots, Ossoff caught up to Perdue to force a runoff, which is done in the state if no candidate wins 50% of the vote. The Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel also appeared to have chipped away at Perdue’s vote share.\n\nThe state is one of the last remaining hopes for Democrats, who have watched a list of more than a dozen potential pickups dwindle as Republicans defeated challenge after challenge across the country, despite Democrats enjoying strong polls in their favor and spending millions of dollars on key races.\n\nDemocrats need at least two more wins to flip the Senate, three if Biden does not win the White House.\n\nThe last remaining options for Democrats lie in North Carolina, where GOP Sen. Thom Tillis appears to have the lead and Alaska, where Democratic candidate Al Gross hopes to unseat Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan. The other is another January runoff in Georgia between incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nTrump focuses on legal path that experts say may not exist\n\nPresident Donald Trump made clear in a series of tweets Friday that he views the courtroom as his best option to winning reelection even though experts say the lawsuits his campaign has filed so far lack a discernible strategy that could deny Joe Biden a widely expected win.\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in battleground states but many of them involve a small number of votes or have been written off by legal experts, such as Rachael Cobb at Suffolk University, as \"throwing a lot of stuff at the wall.\"\n\n\"I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,\" Trump tweeted, reiterating a claim that has been widely debunked for days. \"Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!\"\n\nTrump jumped out to an early lead in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and other key states on Election Day because officials counted in-person, day-of votes first -- as they always do. Those votes favored Trump. Officials then turned to the record number of mail ballots that were cast this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those votes favored Biden, and there have been enough of them to give Biden the lead in most of the remaining battlegrounds.\n\nTrump's latest message was more consistent with the sort of grievance-airing he has offered in two appearances at the White House since Tuesday's election. It was a departure from the more measured statement issued by the Trump campaign earlier Friday in which he vowed to \"never give up fighting for you and our nation.\"\n\nThe latest tweets also underscored that Trump sees his path to victory through a legal fight. The president has repeatedly threatened to put the administration of the election before the Supreme Court, but it's not yet clear on what grounds such a case would be made.\n\nThe recount and legal battle of 2000 that cleared the way for George W. Bush to assume the presidency was focused on one state: Florida. Trump faces a much more difficult challenge in pursuing litigation and recounts in multiple states at the same time — assuming those states are called for Biden.\n\nA loss in any of them would mean losing his legal path to the White House.\n\nBut Twitter isn't a courtroom; arguments there don't have to be based in the law.\n\n\"Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,\" Trump asserted Friday in a tweet. \"I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nWith ballots still being counted, turnout among Americans eligible to vote is close to breaking a 40-year record, a USA TODAY analysis shows.\n\nThe vote could hit a 120-year high by the time counting is done, according to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor whose U.S. Elections Project tracks voter participation.\n\nThe current turnout rate is only half a percentage point lower than the highest level since 1980, 61.6%, in 2008.\n\nAs states count remaining ballots, the turnout could eventually reach more than 66%, the U.S. Elections Project said.\n\nThe project estimated that nearly 160 million Americans voted in this election among about 240 million Americans who are eligible to vote. The last time the rate went any higher was 1900, when 73.7% of eligible voters turned out, and the highest ever was 82.6% in 1876.\n\nAs of Friday night, 42 states had already exceeded their 2016’s voter turnout rates, based on USA TODAY examination of Associated Press vote counts and the U.S. Elections project’s estimates of eligible voters. So far, Hawaii has the biggest growth from 2016, at nearly 15 percentage points, followed by Montana, at 10 percentage points, and Vermont, at 9 percentage points.\n\nFor 2020 voter turnout, Minnesota so far has the nation’s highest rate with nearly 80 percent, followed by Wisconsin and Maine, both with 75 percent.\n\n— Dian Zhang and Dan Keemahill\n\nNonwhite voters are driving Biden’s numbers up in Georgia\n\nNonwhite voters are driving former Vice President Joe Biden’s success in Georgia as outstanding ballots are being counted over the past several days.\n\nUSA TODAY looked at the percentage of Democratic votes won in each Georgia county in 2020 versus the nonwhite population of that county. Just under 80% of Biden’s success in Georgia’s 159 counties can be attributed to the nonwhite population in each county.\n\nUSA TODAY used statistical regression to figure out the correlation between Biden’s share of the vote in each county as of Friday morning and the proportion of nonwhite people in the county according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nGeorgia’s statewide population is just under 33% Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, compared to 13% nationwide. Georgia’s largest city, Atlanta, where many of the state’s outstanding mail-in votes have been counted in recent days, is 52% Black.\n\nThe Rev. James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, said numerous advocacy groups in the state spent about eight years registering voters, educating them on issues, and getting them to the polls. This year, advocacy groups encouraged mail-in voting.\n\n“We’ve pushed our folks to vote by mail and wear masks and socially distance, primarily because we want our people to stay alive while still being able to enfranchise their voices through the ballot process,” Woodall said, pointing to the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on Black Americans.\n\nWhere the election stands:How Biden has a clear path to 270 electoral votes\n\nIn many places, mail-in ballots have been the last votes to be counted due in part to the tedious nature of removing the paper ballots from security envelopes and verifying signatures, and also due to mail delays. The national NAACP is party to the ongoing federal lawsuit that has forced the U.S. Postal Service to ensure timely delivery of mail-in ballots, including in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nAmong the other four states that have remained battlegrounds this week as outstanding ballots are counted — Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania — none showed as strong of a correlation between nonwhite voters and Biden’s success as Georgia’s did.\n\nThe analysis of Pennsylvania’s counties by votes and nonwhite population showed a modest correlation — just over 63%. One of Pennsylvania’s major jurisdictions with outstanding ballots has been Philadelphia County, which is 44% Black.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump calls for 'full transparency' as Biden builds lead\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for \"full transparency\" in the counting of ballots and vowed to \"never give up fighting\" in a statement Friday that came as Democratic nominee Joe Biden edged closer to winning the election.\n\nTrump's latest thoughts on the race, which came in the form of a statement from his campaign, was more subdued than the bombastic remarks he gave at the White House a day earlier in which he leveled a series of baseless accusations about Biden's growing lead in Pennsylvania and other states.\n\n“We believe the American people deserve to have full transparency into all vote counting and election certification, and that this is no longer about any single election,\" Trump said. \"This is about the integrity of our entire election process.\"\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that the process is faulty and has said incorrectly that mail-in ballots being counted after Election Day are fraudulent. In fact, counties and states almost always count absentee and mail-in ballots after Election Day. This year, the number of those mail ballots was dramatically larger because of the pandemic.\n\nThough Trump's rhetoric was less contentious, he offered no sign he is contemplating a concession.\n\n\"We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee that the American people have confidence in our government,\" he said. \"I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.”\n\n– John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nBiden to make primetime speech Friday\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will give a primetime speech Friday, a campaign aide said, as the former vice president continues to widen his lead in battleground states.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Dr. Jill Biden, and Harris' husband Doug Emhoff will also be in attendance, the aide said.\n\nThe former vice president is currently at 264 electoral votes, and is ahead by a slim margin in battleground states Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. If one of those states gets called in his favor, he will pass the 270 electoral votes to become president.\n\nToo close to call:Georgia will recount votes for president because of a slim margin, official says\n\nHarris will speak before Biden, another aide confirmed. Although it’s not customary for the vice presidential candidate to speak at an address of this sort, Harris would be the first woman and first Black vice president in history. Black voters in Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Milwaukee have been credited with pushing Biden closer towards the presidency.\n\nDuring remarks Thursday, Biden called for his supporters to remain calm and said his campaign has “no doubt that when the count is finished Sen. Harris and I will be declared the winners.”\n\n“The processes work, the count is being completed, and we'll know very soon,” he said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden expands lead to nearly 2 points in Nevada as state counts mail ballots\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden on Friday added another 8,000 votes to his lead over President Donald Trump in Nevada, inching closer to winning the perennial presidential battleground and securing a spot in the White House.\n\nState election officials on Friday started releasing some 51,000 late-arriving mail-in ballots cast in the contest. Biden won nearly two-thirds of the first batch of around 30,000 votes, extending his lead over Trump to 22,000 ballots – or roughly 2 percent of votes tallied so far.\n\nNevada, with its six electoral votes, is among a handful of states left to be called in the election, along with Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n– James DeHaven\n\nFlipping counties not a likely factor in 2020 presidential race\n\nLarge numbers of counties flipping support from one party to another is not likely to be a major storyline in this year’s election outcome.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump won in part by flipping over 200 counties that supported President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile there are still a handful of key counties yet to be called, as of Friday morning few have shifted from supporting one party to another.\n\nOf the 489 counties that voted for Clinton in 2016, only 23 have, so far, flipped to Trump.\n\nMost of those counties are small. Thirteen are rural, and not a single large metro county flipped to Trump’s favor. The largest was Nassau County on New York’s Long Island, though the margin is small and the count is not yet finalized.\n\nAs poorly as Trump fared flipping counties, Biden did arguably worse. Of the 2,620 counties that supported Trump four years ago, only 60 appear to have thrown their support to the democratic candidate.\n\nSeven are major population centers, including Maricopa County in Arizona, the fourth-most populous county in the country.\n\nThe vote counts in the counties are nowhere close. The counties that Biden appears to have flipped contain nearly 10 million votes. Those won by Trump have just over a million, combined.\n\nThere are 3,141 counties and population is concentrated: Half of the country’s population lives in just 150.\n\n– Matt Wynn\n\nUSPS finds thousands of ballots in PA and NC, races to deliver them\n\nSweeps of U.S. Postal Service mail-processing facilities in Pennsylvania and North Carolina on Thursday found 2,243 undelivered ballots, according to a filing in the U.S. District Court of Washington D.C. early Friday.\n\nIn each case the ballots were delivered to local elections offices, the USPS said in the filing, which is part of an ongoing lawsuit to ensure the delivery of mail-in ballots cast in the general election. Pennsylvania accepts mail-in ballots for up to three days after the election if they’re postmarked by Election Day.\n\nFor this election, North Carolina accepts ballots up to nine days late, as long as they were postmarked on Election Day.\n\nBoth are battleground states where votes continue to be counted in the race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nPostal service officials will be in court again today with District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan at 11 a.m. EDT. Sullivan has ordered the agency to conduct twice-daily sweeps to ensure all outstanding ballots are found and delivered.\n\n- Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nGeorgia will have a presidential recount, state official says\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said Friday morning the state would have a recount because of the slim election margin.\n\n“Right now, Georgia remains too close to call,” he said. “There will be a recount.”\n\nUnder Georgia state law, candidates can request a recount if the margin of victory is less than 0.5%. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gained a small lead over President Donald Trump early Friday morning. The two candidates are separated by about 1,100 votes.\n\n“We are literally looking at a margin of less than a large high school,” Georgia’s voting system implementation manager Gabriel Sterling said. According to Sterling, the state had about 4,169 votes left to count. A recount could take until the end of the month, he noted. The state pays for recounts in Georgia.\n\nTrump and his allies, without citing evidence, have alleged election fraud, but Sterling rejected the claims.\n\n“We’re not seeing any widespread irregularities,” he said.\n\nA recount in the Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was unlikely given current vote totals, Sterling said. The two Senate candidates are separated by close to 100,000 votes, or about 2 percentage points. The Senate race is instead poised to head to a runoff election in January.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nKudlow: 'I think there will be a peaceful transfer of power'\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his staff say they are not giving up on the election, despite signs Joe Biden could capture enough states to carry the Electoral College. But they are also saying the president will respect a peaceful transfer of power if it comes to that.\n\n\"I think there will be a peaceful transfer of power,\" Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview on CNBC. \"This is the greatest country in the world and we abide by the rule of law as will the president.”\n\nKudlow also said he has spoken with the president and that he \"intends to fight\" and prevail, a message also delivered by the president's reelection campaign.\n\n\"This election is not over,\" said Matt Morgan, the Trump 2020 campaign general counsel.\n\nThe statements come the morning after an angry tirade from Trump in which he falsely accused election officials in contested states of trying to \"steal\" the election from him. There is no evidence that is happening.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Here we go guys!': Biden supporters await news in Delaware\n\nWith Joe Biden on the cusp of a presidential victory Friday morning, his supporters gathered in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. The excitement was palpable in a parking lot outside the Chase Center, where Biden is expected to speak later.\n\nSupporters, who held signs and American flags, exchanged shouts of, “It’s gonna be a great day” and “Here we go, guys!”\n\nThomas Kunish, 40, likened it to a tailgate party. He had arrived in Wilmington from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his five-year-old son. He perched a stuffed dinosaur holding a Biden-Harris sign on his pickup truck and tossed a football back and forth with his son as they waited.\n\nSome supporters, like Zach Rossetti, 25, have been here for days. After watching Biden vote in their shared hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Election Day, Rossetti drove to Wilmington to await a result. He’s been spending his days at the Chase Center and nights at a hotel — but today felt different. “I am so certain we’re going to have a result today,” he said.\n\nBeverly Relyea, 62, a Wilmington native, hasn’t been keeping vigil in the parking lot. But she said she knew it was time to come after a Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania earlier this morning. “Got my clothes on, put my hat on, and I came,” she said.\n\nFor now, the wait continues.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nBiden takes lead in Pennsylvania\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden edged ahead of President Donald Trump in the all-important battleground of Pennsylvania for the first time Friday, adding to a sense of inevitability that the Scranton native would reach the 270 electoral votes he needs to capture the presidency.\n\nBiden leads the president by more than 13,000 votes, a difference of 0.2%.\n\nVotes were still being counted and Biden had not been declared the winner in the Keystone State. Republicans argued that at least some of the outstanding ballots would go for Trump.\n\nBut the momentum and the math increasingly appears to be on Biden’s side.\n\nPennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, was part of the so-called “blue wall” that had carried past Democrats to the White House until 2016. Two other states in the wall, Michigan and Wisconsin, were called for Biden on Wednesday.\n\nTrump got out to an early lead in Pennsylvania Tuesday, but Biden has been closing the gap ever since as a crush of mail-in ballots were counted. Polls had always suggested Democrats were more likely to vote by mail because of concerns about the pandemic. In this case, the polls were right.\n\nAlso, Trump had cast doubts on the security of mail voting for months before the election, a line of attack that had made some Republican operatives in states like Pennsylvania and Florida nervous that it would affect their own voters.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Trump’s margin narrowed even as his campaign aides prematurely declared they had won the state. It closed as Trump incorrectly claimed he had won the election. It got smaller as aides alleged widespread fraud, without citing evidence, and threatened lawsuits.\n\nTrump led Biden in the state by several hundred thousand votes immediately after the election, which was the count of people who turned out in person on Election Day.\n\nTrump won the state by about 44,300 votes in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a 0.72% difference.\n\n– John Fritze and Nicholas Wu\n\nFAA restricts airspace over Biden’s home\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration placed restrictions on airspace over Joe Biden’s home, affording the Democratic nominee the same security restriction provided to other political VIPs such as the president and vice president.\n\nWhile the temporary flight restrictions (TFR) appeared to be activated on Friday, it was not clear when they were announced. The FAA referred questions about the restrictions, which limit flights through the area, to the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nThe TFRs, which will be in place over Wilmington, Delaware, for several days, are commonly imposed when the president or vice president is traveling out of Washington for an event, such as to a rally.\n\nLike other candidates, Biden received Secret Service protection earlier this year. His security detail was set to grow in coming days as the Secret Service prepared for the possibility he wins, The Washington Post and CNN reported this week.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden takes the lead from Trump in Georgia\n\nDemocratic candidate Joe Biden officially took the lead in Georgia Friday, after a new round of results were released.\n\nAs of 4:30 a.m. EST, the former Vice President leads by 917 votes with thousands of ballots remaining to be counted.\n\nBiden caught then passed Trump in the traditionally red state due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic-leaning counties. Democratic voters utilized early voting and mail-in ballots across the nation more so than Republicans.\n\nGeorgia is critical to Trump’s reelection, but not necessary to Biden’s path to the White House.\n\nThe state has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, when Bill Clinton won the state by 13,000 votes. Trump beat Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Georgia in 2016 by 211,141 votes, or 50.4% to 45.3%.\n\nClayton County, which was represented by the late Rep. John Lewis, was one of the counties that put Biden over the top in Georgia.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nTrump draws closer to Biden in Arizona ballot count\n\nPresident Donald Trump inched closer to former Vice President Joe Biden in Arizona as results from Thursday's ballot counting were released, but he fell off the pace needed to win the state's 11 electoral votes.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Biden on Wednesday, but the Trump campaign hopes votes still to be counted will change the outcome.\n\nStatewide, Trump chipped away 22,000 votes from Biden's lead, closing the gap to 46,667 votes as of Thursday night. But unless the next batches of votes show Trump with a higher percentage than what the president managed Thursday, he will fall short.\n\nThe Arizona Republic estimates there were 300,000 votes left to count statewide as of Thursday evening, with 218,000 of those votes left to count in Maricopa County.\n\n– Rob O'Dell, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Caitlin McGlade (Arizona Republic)\n\nCould today be the day?\n\nNo states were called Thursday in the presidential election, but Friday may well be the day the election ends when most of the remaining battleground states hit the home stretch in counting and even call some races.\n\nBiden begins the day with 264 Electoral College votes to Trump's 214. That means Biden needs to win one of the four remaining battleground states: Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. All of them are expected to make significant progress or finish counting outright.\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic nominee Joe Biden took the lead Friday morning as vote-counting continues.\n\nMore:Georgia solidifies its swing-state status thanks, in part, to Stacey Abrams\n\nIn Pennsylvania, major counties such as Philadelphia have been counting through the night, and the president's lead there is also narrowing.\n\nBiden gained ground due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nMore:We fact-checked President Trump's speech about the election.

The remaining 66,596 votes were cast by same-day registrants either in-person on Tuesday or during the state's two-week early voting period.\n\nSome 90% of the outstanding ballots are in Clark County, a southern Nevada stronghold for Democrats where the party built up a daunting 89,000-voter edge over Republicans in early voting turnout.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/arizona-election-live-updates-2020-senate-state-and-local-races/6056252002/", "title": "Arizona 2020 election updates: State turns blue, votes for Kelly ...", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nIt's the day after the election.

The national presidential race between Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump is too close to call.\n\nBiden's win in Arizona is the first presidential victory for a Democratic candidate since 1996 when Bill Clinton won the state.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election saw Arizona on the verge of being competitive for Democrats with Trump's margins much thinner than the Republicans before him. He carried the state by about 3.5 points.\n\nArizona was the first state to flip in the presidential race though several key swing states remained up in the air Wednesday morning.\n\nNationwide, Trump and Biden each claimed early and predictable state calls, with Trump projected to win Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and North and South Carolina.

He said there were many votes left to count and that he shouldn't be discounted yet, contradicting his comments about other swing states with large number of outstanding votes where he has falsely claimed he had won.\n\nHe said it would’ ve been “nice” to win but that winning Arizona wasn’t necessary to getting elected to a second term.\n\n— Rachel Leingang and Paulina Pineda\n\n12:30 a.m.: Dem grassroots groups celebrate possibility of turning Arizona blue\n\nVotes were still being counted in Arizona when cheers erupted from community organizers in south Phoenix who declared they were turning the state blue.\n\nDown-ballot victories for Democratic candidates in the traditional Republican stronghold were celebrated as “vindication of all the pain and suffering we’ve seen in the community.”\n\nActivists from the Unite Here labor union, CASE Action social justice group and Living United for Change grassroots organization applauded voter drives that they said helped bring thousands of young voters to the polls in 2020.\n\nOrganizers outside the CASE Action offices on Seventh Avenue just before 11 p.m. said just “showing up” was a victory.\n\n“Never in my life did I think we would be up in the air here in Arizona,” said Marisela Mares, 22, referring to a presidential election that was too close to call. “It could be a very close race. We’re pushing that margin.”\n\nMares, who started organizing with Unite Here eight years ago at 14, said Arizona has evolved from a red state in 2010 to a purple state in 2018 to a blue one on Tuesday night. Organizers for years have made a determined effort to convince Hispanic and young voters that they could make a difference, Mares said.\n\n“I think it’s a lot more blue than we were, even just two years ago,” Mares said. “I don’t know what color is between blue and purple, but we are there.”\n\nUnite Here organizer Maria Hernandez said union members, primarily hospitality workers, many of whom have lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, blitzed the state since June, knocking on as many as 800,000 doors.\n\n“The fact that we got to this point in Arizona is no accident,” she said. “We are instilling hope where there was once fear.”\n\nTuesday’s results proved when the community comes together, it can speak with a powerful voice, said Stephanie Maldonado, campaign director for Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA.\n\n“We were told, ‘Latinos don’t show up.’ But Latinos showed up,” she said. “We showed up, we voted early and we trusted a system. It was 10 years in the making; 10 years to get to today, 10 years to ensure our voices, our families and our communities were represented.”\n\nMaldonado said the movement was led by people under 30. She said they were motivated by anger over SB 1070, Arizona’s notorious immigration measure passed in 2010, which targeted undocumented immigrants with some of the strictest laws in the country.\n\n“Young people showed up and represented in Arizona,” she said. “Why? Because 10 years ago, we couldn’t vote. Ten years ago, we saw our parents and our community impacted by SB 1070, and tonight young people showed up and we won.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n11:45 p.m.: 2 people say they couldn't vote after being kicked out of vote center\n\nTwo siblings say they were among a small group of voters denied a vote and removed by law enforcement from a vote center in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday evening despite being in line by the 7 p.m. cutoff.\n\nIt was one of only a few allegations of voters being turned away from polling sites in Arizona as of Tuesday night, and the only one involving law enforcement.\n\nTimitria Thompson, 22, and her 24-year-old brother, Adrion Thompson, told The Republic that they were in line at 7 p.m. when they were asked to leave a polling place near Seventh and Southern avenues because it had closed.\n\nThe siblings said they insisted on being allowed to vote but that a man running the polling location kept trying to kick them out and eventually called police.\n\nAt least four Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to the scene and threatened to arrest Timitria Thompson on suspicion of trespassing and disorderly conduct, she said.\n\nAfter waiting in the polling place for more than an hour, Timitria Thompson said law enforcement eventually pushed her out.\n\nA Sheriff's Office spokesperson confirmed deputies were at the scene but said they \"did not take any law enforcement actions.\" A Phoenix Police Department spokesperson said the Sheriff's Office called Phoenix police to the scene but no arrests were made.\n\n— Chelsea Curtis\n\n11:20 p.m.: County Recorder Fontes says voting went without a hitch\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes told The Republic after polls closed Tuesday that voting went \"very, very well.\"\n\nA couple dozen locations had long lines after polls closed, but workers got them in and out quickly, he said.\n\nThroughout the day, very few voters had to wait more than 45 minutes.\n\nThere were a few snafus, he said, including some printers that ran out of ink. But those problems were addressed quickly.\n\n\"All in all, very positive feedback from the vast majority of voters that we had contact with,\" he said. \"I think this system worked very well.\"\n\nAbout 167,000 voters in Maricopa County cast ballots in person on Tuesday. That doesn't include people who dropped off signed and sealed ballots at the polls.\n\nThe county said it will continue to update election results throughout the night until all ballots cast in person on Tuesday are counted. Ballots that were dropped off will be verified and counted later in the week.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n11 p.m.: Joe Biden says he's 'confident about Arizona'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke to a car rally in Wilmington, Delaware, about 10:40 p.m. Arizona time on Tuesday, telling the crowd to be patient and expressing confidence that his campaign would prevail.\n\n“We're confident about Arizona. That's a turnaround,” Biden said.\n\nHe stressed the importance of counting all votes before declaring a winner.\n\n“We're gonna have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished, and it ain't over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted,” Biden said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted, without evidence, that he was winning big and that “they” were trying to “STEAL the Election.”\n\n“We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” he wrote.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n10:45 p.m.: Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel admitted to hospital\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Allister Adel was taken to the hospital for a health emergency, Jennifer Liewer, the office’s spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nInformation on Adel’s condition is limited at this time and “the situation is fluid.”\n\n“We ask for the community's thoughts and prayers at this time,” Liewer said.\n\nEarlier this evening, Adel’s campaign told The Republic, the county attorney was waiting for the first round of results at home with her family.\n\nDemocratic challenger Julie Gunnigle leads Adel in early returns in the Maricopa County attorney's race.\n\nGunnigle wrote on Twitter that she wished Adel “a full recovery.” She found out about the health emergency online.\n\n“My thoughts are with Allister and her family,” she wrote.\n\n— Lauren Castle\n\n10 p.m.: Mark Kelly speaks in Tucson\n\nAt an event in Tucson, Democrat Mark Kelly told supporters he is confident that he will defeat incumbent U.S. Sen.

Hansen\n\n9:45 p.m.: AZ Republicans, Democrats hold election night events\n\nNearly 200 members of the Arizona Republican Party gathered Tuesday night for an election result watch party, at least half decked out in Trump gear.\n\nThe invite-only event started at 7 p.m. in a courtyard near the intersection of Arizona Avenue and Boston Street in Chandler.\n\nState Treasurer Kimberly Yee opened the night.\n\n“So many of you have been a part of our movement of knocking on doors and getting people out there to vote, thank you,” Yee said.\n\nSupporter Denise Phillips praised the president’s work with the economy.\n\n“I went to his last rally in Goodyear,” Phillips said, “It is just amazing … I have never seen anyone draw that type of energy. He is such a rock star.”\n\nAlthough Phillips is extremely supportive of the president, she admitted to having doubts about him securing the presidency for a second term.\n\n“I knew in my heart in 2016 that he was going to win, but now I’m a little more worried,” Phillips said.\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Party leaders erupted with cheers at a watch party in Phoenix as initial county vote totals that dropped at 8 p.m. showed Democrats with sizable leads in key races.\n\nSome shouted, “Oh my god!” multiple times as they scrolled down the Maricopa County Recorder Office’s website, which showed Joe Biden and Mark Kelly leading the vote in the county while Democrats led in the county races for attorney, sheriff, recorder and assessor.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes lauded the county’s high voter turnout.\n\n“Even though there might still be a couple people in line here — by the way, stay in line if you’re in line and vote — we created a system that makes it very, very easy,” Fontes said. “In fact, it is so easy to vote in Maricopa County, that we’ve got record numbers even during a global pandemic.”\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Chair Steven Slugocki said the state’s most populous county would transform the state from the Republican stronghold it once was.\n\n“Tonight, we made history in Maricopa County by turning this county blue,” Slugocki said. “Maricopa County is going to lead the way to Arizona turning blue. We are no longer a red state in Arizona.”\n\n— Katelyn Keenehan and Perry Vandell\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona returns 7 US House incumbents, per AP\n\nThe Associated Press has called seven Arizona U.S. House races for incumbents.\n\nIncumbent Democrats Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick and Greg Stanton and incumbent Republicans Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and Andy Biggs will return to Congress.\n\nThe two other congressional races are too close to call.\n\nIn early returns, incumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in District 1 U.S. House race and Democrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Rep. David Schweikert in District 6 U.S. House race.\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona voters legalize marijuana, according to AP\n\nArizona voters approved a ballot measure to legalize marijuana, according to the Associated Press.\n\nProposition 207 will legalize possession of as much as an ounce of marijuana for adults 21 and older and set up a licensing system for retail sales of the drug, starting with the medical-marijuana dispensaries already operating in the state. Sales will begin in March under the measure.\n\nThe measure also allows people previously convicted of marijuana crimes, such as the felony charge for possession, to have their records expunged by the courts.\n\nAnd it establishes special \"social equity\" licenses for communities historically disenfranchised by marijuana laws.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n9 p.m.: Democrats have slight lead in race for 3 seats on Arizona Corporation Commission\n\nDemocrats are ahead in the first returns of the six-way race for three seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, which sets rates and policies for utilities in the state, including how much renewable energy they are required to use.\n\nEarly ballots counted and posted Tuesday in Arizona are thought to skew towards registered Democrats, with more Republicans showing up in person Tuesday to vote. While Democrats led, the margin between them and the Republicans was small.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n8 p.m.: Gallego, Ortega and Peterson lead in mayoral races\n\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego leads challengers Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay in early results.\n\nFormer council member David Ortega leads opponent Lisa Borowsky in the race for Scottsdale mayor, according to early election results.\n\nBrigette Peterson leads Matt Nielsen in the race for Gilbert mayor, according to early results.\n\n— Jen Fifield, Lorraine Longhi and Alison Steinbach\n\n8 p.m.: Julie Gunnigle leads Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race\n\nDemocrat challenger Julie Gunnigle leads County Attorney Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Paul Penzone leads Jerry Sheridan in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race\n\nIncumbent Democrat Paul Penzone leads Republican Jerry Sheridan, former deputy to Joe Arpaio, in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Tipirneni leads Schweikert in House race\n\nDemocrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Republican Rep. David Schweikert in early returns in U.S. House District 6 race.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: O’Halleran leads Shedd in House race\n\nIncumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in early returns in District 1 U.S. House race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Education Prop. 208 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 208, which would raise taxes on the wealthy to fund education in Arizona, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Marijuana Prop. 207 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Mark Kelly leads Martha McSally in early returns in Senate race\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly leads Republican Senator Martha McSally in early returns in the U.S. Senate race with national implications.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in Arizona early returns\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in Arizona early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n7:45 p.m.: Some lines remain after polls closed\n\nAbout 100 voters remained in line at Mesa Community College after polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\nVoters in line before 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast votes as long as they stay in line.\n\nCampaign volunteers and poll observers who were stationed at the site said voters were told that a ballot printing machine went down for about an hour and a half around 4:30 p.m., which caused a major backup.\n\nRandy Perez, a volunteer with Arizona Center for Empowerment, said he notified the county as soon as he heard about the issues with the machine, but it still took over an hour to fix.\n\n\"They should have fixed the machine faster or informed voters of other options,\" Perez said.\n\nA Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson said the ballot printer did not break, but was running slowly for about a half hour. She said the county deployed technicians who were able to get the machines running at a normal speed.\n\nAt 7 p.m., a poll worker called out the line to vote was closing. Sarai Soto, 34, walked up within a minute. The poll worker turned her away. A fight erupted between poll watchers, a man in line and the poll worker over the woman’s right to vote\n\nThe woman said that because of poor signage to direct voters to where to vote on the large campus she had spent 30 minutes looking for the polling place\n\n​She said she waited for about 20 minutes at another campus building with about four other voters also looking for the polling place\n\nShe said she’s Puerto Rican, and cares deeply about voting in this election.\n\n\"It was my first time voting. Now, I don’t get to vote,\" Soto said.\n\nThe line to vote at Surprise City Hall wrapped around the building and doubled back inside around 6:30 p.m. with more than 150 voters waiting to cast ballots. The line moved quickly, however, and there were only a few voters left waiting by 7:30 p.m.\n\nEdward Wagner, 58, a Republican with his two young daughters in tow, said his wait of more than an hour was worth it to vote for Trump and the GOP at all levels of office in “the biggest election of the century.”\n\nWagner criticized Democrats for disrespecting Trump, trying to block him at every turn and waging a “faulty impeachment” effort.\n\nSeeing violence rise in his hometown of Chicago and other cities led by Democrats turned him away from the party, he said.\n\nA former Peace Corps volunteer who met his wife in Africa, Wagner said he understands the problem of racial inequity but believes that Democrats haven’t succeeded in fixing it. He praised Trump for signing a prison reform bill and said he would support the president going further on the issue.\n\nAs a Catholic, Wagner said he opposes abortion and believes in a traditional view of family, which he said Trump has a good record on.\n\nWagner said his family takes pandemic precautions seriously and he mourns the more than 230,000 dead, but he said with medical treatments improving, the country can’t afford more economic closures.\n\nTrump’s strength has been impressive, Wagner said.\n\n“He is as tough as nails. Just look at how he recovered from COVID himself, holding four rallies a day. He’s worked really hard,” Wagner said.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez and Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n7:30 p.m.: 2 downtown Phoenix businesses boarded up in case of protests\n\nAnticipating protests following Election Day results, at least two businesses in downtown Phoenix have taken precautions to protect their buildings.\n\nSnooze A.M. Eatery near Central Avenue and McKinley Street was seen boarding up its windows on Tuesday afternoon. According to Chris Lee, a Fix It Services manager, Snooze called the handyman company to board up their downtown location due to \"alleged riots.\"\n\nThe Wells Fargo location in downtown Phoenix also mounted wood boards over their exterior windows.\n\n\"We're just kind of closely monitoring things out of an abundance of caution and for the safety of employees and customers,\" said LiAna Enriquez, a Wells Fargo spokesperson in Phoenix. \"We're aware of concerns of the possibility of post-election demonstrations.\"\n\nThe downtown location is the only one in Arizona that will board up its windows, Enriquez said, because it is close to the Capitol where numerous protests were held over the summer.\n\n\"As a precaution, we are boarding windows of a small number of branch locations in select cities. Any branches that have been boarded are operating normally, unless they were already temporarily closed due to COVID-19,\" Enriquez said in a statement.\n\nPhoenix City Hall, which has also been a popular meeting spot for protesters this year, was not boarded up as of Tuesday evening, Phoenix Public Works Department spokesperson Yvette G. Roeder confirmed.\n\n\"However, the Public Works Department is prepared with materials, should the need arise,\" she said.\n\nSeveral Arizona Department of Public Safety vehicles were seen in the parking lot of the Arizona House of Representatives on Tuesday evening, but spokesperson Bart Graves said troopers will be staffed at \"normal levels\" on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department Headquarters was surrounded by barricades as it has been since protests began in downtown Phoenix in May after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nMaggie Cox, a Phoenix police spokesperson, said as of Tuesday evening, the department has \"additional officers mobilized\" and has been working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to \"ensure the safety of our community.\"\n\n\"While we have no information to indicate there will be criminal activity as a result of the election, we will continue to monitor activity related to demonstrations and responses will be determined by intelligence-driven information,\" Cox said. \"We also remind community members, 'If you see something, say something.'\"\n\n— Jamie Landers and Emily Wilder\n\n7 p.m.: Polls close in Arizona for anyone not already in line\n\nPolls have officially closed across Arizona. However, any voter who was in line at 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast a ballot.\n\nThe first batch of results are expected around 8 p.m. Those results will consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\nSubsequent reports later in the evening will include ballots cast at polling places on Election Day.\n\nMail ballots dropped off on Election Day must go through the same signature matching and curing process as all the other mail ballots. These ballots may not appear in the results for a few days.\n\n— Jessica Boehm and Andrew Oxford\n\n6:45 p.m.: Hiral Tipirneni thanks voters before polls close\n\nA little over an hour before polls closed, as a line of voters snaked through the campus of Paradise Valley Community College, congressional candidate Hiral Tipirneni stopped for one of the campaign’s final visits.\n\n“Thank you for voting,” Tipirneni told voters as they streamed past, her voice a little muffled by a bright pink mask that said “VOTE” in sparkling silver.\n\nA boy who looked old enough to vote told her he wasn’t. “Well, hopefully you’re with somebody who’s voting,” Tipirneni told him. “And in a couple years, you’ll be here to vote.”\n\nTipirneni, who is challenging Rep. David Schweikert in a close race, did not draw much attention. She stood outside the 75-foot electioneering boundary, hands folded at her waist, and thanked voters as they walked to the back of the line.\n\nFew voters seemed to recognize the candidate. She turned to a group of campaign staffers behind her. “They’re like, who is this woman?” she said, referring to the people walking past. “And why is she all dressed up to come to the polls?”\n\nA few minutes later, one of her staff walked off, and returned with a crisp white campaign sign. The staffer jammed the sign into the roots of a tree, and they headed to the next polling place.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n6:35 p.m.: Trump voters energized in Tucson\n\nAn enthusiastic group of nearly 20 Republican voters gathered in the Tucson suburb of Casas Adobes on Tuesday afternoon to show their support for President Donald Trump with a few hours remaining before polls close in Arizona.\n\nMany of these supporters said they chose to vote earlier in the day in person at the polls, taking cues from Trump, who has cast doubts on the safety of the vote-by-mail process despite no evidence of voter fraud.\n\n“I’m not going to send my mail, the ballot for president of the United States. That is too severe and it’s too important. So I went to a polling place because I know that it’s more secure and it’s harder to be thrown out,” said Joseph Abeyta from Tucson.\n\nThe diverse group of supporters waved flags and signs, with cars honking in support or in opposition at the intersections of Oracle and Ina roads. The group gathered in front in the Safeway plaza where in 2011 a gunman shot and injured former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, whose husband, Mark Kelly is on the ballot as the Democratic Senate candidate.\n\nThis precinct is part of the Republican suburbs that ring the heavily Democratic city of Tucson, and had some of the highest vote totals in Pima County for Trump in 2016.\n\nMelissa Shaw showed up to the rally with her 11-year-old daughter Trista after casting her ballot in person. She said her daughter was top of mind when she voted for Trump.\n\n“I want a strong economy. I want her to go to college and work for something. I don’t want her to go to college and think, ‘Oh, all of my debt is gonna be paid off.' I want her to go to college and pay for it and earn it,” she said.\n\nPima County skews heavily Democrat. But in the last month of the campaign Trump and Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Tucson on multiple occasions to boost turnout among his supporters in hopes of offsetting his projected losses in southern Arizona.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n6:30 p.m.: Youth excited to vote\n\nMohammed Mohammed, 23, of Tempe, voted for Joe Biden at Tempe Escalante Community Center.\n\nHe said he was driven to vote because he wanted to see racial justice and more education opportunities for young people.\n\n“The most important thing that matters for me is a president that’s going to help the students, help with education. Kind of solve the systemic problems that we have in America today,\" Mohammed said.\n\nMohammed is one of hundreds of thousands of young people across the country committed to making their voices heard this election.\n\n“All my friends are voting. The way that it was so crucial, especially for the year 2020, just made everyone vote,\" he said.\n\nMohammed said this election was the first time he took local elections seriously. He was eager to vote for Proposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, because he believes Arizona will benefit from taxing marijuana.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez\n\n6 p.m.: U.S. Postal Service misses order to sweep facilities for ballots\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service failed to meet a judge’s order on Tuesday for a sweep of its mail processing facilities in a dozen districts across the United States, including Arizona, to search for undelivered absentee ballots.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the sweep on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the NAACP and other groups after the Postal Service said about 300,000 ballots had not been scanned as delivered.\n\nOther postal facilities singled out for inspection include some in central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Detroit, Colorado/Wyoming, Atlanta, Houston, Alabama, northern New England, greater South Carolina, South Florida and Lakeland.\n\nSullivan, who is based in Washington, D.C., ordered the sweep for early Tuesday afternoon but the Postal Service said in a response it was “unable to accelerate\" its ongoing daily review process to conduct the sweep \"without significantly disrupting preexisting activities on the day of the election.”\n\nThe Postal Service said it is already conducting daily reviews of 220 facilities across the country handling election mail.\n\nRod Spurgeon, a spokesperson for the Postal Service in Arizona, said: “We do not currently have any issues impacting the timely delivery of ballots but will continue to monitor and be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nSullivan wrote Tuesday that he would let the Postal Service’s ongoing process continue but added the agency “shall be prepared to discuss the apparent lack of compliance with the court's order” during a hearing on Wednesday.\n\n— Andrew Oxford\n\n5:30 p.m.: Disparate views in Glendale\n\nPeople streamed steadily into the polling place at Glendale Community College in the mid-afternoon, but lines to vote in person were only a few minutes long, voters reported.\n\nFernando Cazares said equality for immigrants and LGBTQ people were key factors driving his vote for Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough he respects Trump voters, he said he generally disagrees with Trump's policies.\n\n“I want for everybody to be treated the same,” Cazares said.\n\nCazares, a 19-year-old caregiver, said it was his first time voting. He went to the Glendale Community College polling place on his day off with a friend to cheer him on who is an immigrant and could not vote.\n\n“This election is going to be one for the history books,” Cazares said. “It feels good. People went through a lot just to be able to vote. Being able to vote in itself is a privilege.”\n\nWearing a camouflage Army hat and standing in the shade as the afternoon temperature hit 90 degrees, Calvin Hamilton said he was proud to vote for a second time for Trump.\n\n“I wasn’t one of those silent voters,” Hamilton, 75, said. “I’m a Trumper.”\n\nThe military veteran said he likes Trump’s cuts to government and regulations.\n\n“He kept his word. When’s the last time you could say that about a president?” Hamilton said.\n\nThe election is “paramount to the future,” Hamilton said. “We have more government than we need.”\n\nRyker Martin, 28, a Glendale resident aiming to become a teacher, said he had become disillusioned with the political process after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so he cast a protest vote for president in 2020, writing in the \"Star Trek\" character Jean-Luc Picard.\n\n“I think the left-right dichotomy is built out of fear,” Martin said. “It’s the same thing every time. … I’m tired of the same old, same old. I don’t see the point of voting for any party.”\n\nMartin said he voted in favor of state propositions to legalize marijuana and to raise taxes on high-income earners to fund education, even though he worries some of the revenue raised for education will get wasted.\n\n“I’ve been in situations when I was in high school where we couldn’t even pay for paper, but we had people with six-figure salaries overloading the administration,” he said. “But the schools do need money, and if it’s going to keep them afloat until we can fix something about it, it’s the best I can do.”\n\n— Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n5:15 p.m. Some vote centers busy while neighboring locations quiet\n\nSome vote centers have seen long lines throughout the day, but locations just a few miles away from those sites have had no lines at all.\n\nVoters can check wait times and lines at locations.maricopa.vote.\n\nSurprise City Hall saw waits of 30 minutes or more throughout the afternoon. At about 5:20 p.m., the wait was about 51 minutes and there were more than 200 people in line. But just 2.4 miles away, R.H. Johnson Recreation Center in Sun City West reported no wait.\n\nMini Social, a location in downtown Scottsdale, also saw lines throughout the day. As of about 5:15 p.m., the wait was about 22 minutes and there were 69 people in line. Just 3 miles from there, Scottsdale Plaza Shopping Center saw a wait time of two minutes, with 10 people in line.\n\nAt the main voting location in Tolleson, Esther Angulo Community Center, the time to vote about 4:30 p.m. was about 38 minutes, with 122 people in line. About 2 miles away at Rio Vista School in Avondale, the wait was 2 minutes and there were 5 people in line.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n5 p.m.: Queen Creek voters allege voter harassment\n\nVoters at a Queen Creek vote center reported being harassed shortly before 1 p.m. by people who honked horns at them, yelled at them and tried to take their photographs.\n\nThe incident, which took place at a higher education complex called Communiversity, was reported to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office as well as to the Election Protection hotline run by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n“One of our field volunteers reported this issue and had the voter call into the hotline,” Election Protection spokesperson Ian Weiner said via email Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“We received this complaint and were able to mobilize our coalition to address and ultimately resolve the issue. We sent a team of trained de-escalators (called “Election Defenders”) and raised it to the Secretary of State who also alerted the county to get the matter resolved,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Recorder’s office said she heard that individuals had yelled at voters, but that if it occurred outside the 75-foot limit surrounding polling places it was not illegal.\n\nShe added that anyone outside the 75-foot limit was also allowed to photograph anyone going into or out of a polling place.\n\nShe said the office also received reports that people were telling voters outside the polling place that they should use ballpoint pens on their ballots instead of the Sharpie pens provided in the voting booths.\n\nVoters can use ballpoint pen in black or blue ink or a Sharpie, and vote centers use fine-tip Sharpies as they have the fastest drying ink. If ballpoint ink is not allowed to dry completely, it can smudge off onto the optical readers and spoil other ballots, according to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office.\n\nA plainclothes Maricopa County Sheriff's deputy was sent to investigate and found that a woman was handing voters ballpoint pens with a flyer urging them to not use sharpies. The woman was told to stop and agreed to leave. The spokeswoman said new optical reading equipment was brought to the site to ensure ballots were read correctly.\n\n— John D'Anna\n\n4:45 p.m.: Growing line in west Phoenix\n\nA line of about 40 people formed outside a west Phoenix vote center at Pendergast Early Learning Center in the afternoon.\n\nArizona State University criminal justice major Mario Torres, 21, was able to leave his shift at Amazon early to vote on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the company allowed employees three hours off to cast their ballots on Election Day.\n\nTorres said he felt that the presidential race was the most consequential on the ballot because, \"I don’t think who's in office right now is beneficial to our country.”\n\nHe said he's most concerned about racial injustice, environmental issues and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he's hopeful a new president will create change in those areas — even if it takes a while.\n\n\"Change probably takes a long time to happen, as we’ve seen. But having someone who is more humanistic will help our society,\" Torres said.\n\n— José-Ignacio Castañeda\n\n4:30 p.m.: Advocacy group alleges voter suppression\n\nMembers of the organization Mi Familia Vota reported that they have received complaints from Spanish-speaking voters across the country about threatening calls and false information intended to confuse and discourage them from voting.\n\n\"The reports we have received are about intimidation and false information that are causing confusion in our voters,\" said Eduardo Sáinz, state director of Mi Familia Vota in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our message is clear: We have until today at 7 p.m. to participate in Arizona and we want our community to come out and vote to see the change we are waiting for,\" he said.\n\nSáinz did not present evidence, but said the reports come from reliable sources in the community.\n\nHe said that there is a helpline in Spanish that is 888-VE-Y-VOTA for people to call and report any false information or threats received regarding the elections.\n\nMi Familia Vota is a national civic engagement organization that advocates for social and economic issues that affect the Latino community, from immigration to worker rights.\n\n— Javier Arce\n\n4:15 p.m.: Active voters in central Phoenix\n\nThe first time she was eligible to vote, Pricilla Galaviz let the election pass by.\n\nNot this time. The 22-year-old stopped by the Phoenix Union High School District Office vote center on her way to the gym to cast her first ballot, thinking the entire time of friends and family who didn’t have that option.\n\nShe wanted to represent her Latino community, like her friends with DACA status and her father, who’s a resident but not a citizen. Somebody needed to speak for them. Galaviz, who works as a medical assistant at a surgery center, believed her vote could help.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said. “I’m voting for them. For the people who can’t.”\n\nAsked to pick her most important vote, Galaviz said she couldn’t choose. She’d researched them all. The opportunity to vote at all felt “amazing,” she said.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said.\n\nRuth Steen, a Phoenix elementary school teacher, spends her days around young people, and she wanted them to see that voting is important.\n\n“If they could watch me go in and do it, maybe other people would walk in,” she said after casting a ballot in central Phoenix. “Maybe if I see more people actually going in, somebody will stop and go, ‘Oh, I should go vote.’”\n\nEspecially this year. Steen said she was particularly motivated to vote against President Trump — \"I don’t like his character\" — and for Proposition 207, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona.\n\nSteen said she’d done her research, and saw a benefit in the taxes that legalization would raise. “I heard the states that have done it have done very well, as far as getting money to go back to them,” she said.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n3:45 p.m.: Mixed turnout in northern Arizona\n\nThe sun finally broke through thunderstorm clouds around 3 p.m. outside a voting location at Flagstaff Mall, where a handful of people lined up to vote.\n\nIt was a quiet affair, people meandering in and out of the poll with their young children, on their way to class at nearby Northern Arizona University or as they headed into the mall.\n\nIn the parking lot, a car emblazoned with pro-Biden bumper stickers and painted “Every Vote Matters!” sat only a few spaces from a truck flying a \"Thin Blue Line\" flag. Eventually they both pulled away, their drivers returning from inside each wearing “I Voted!” stickers.\n\nEarlier in the day, about 40 people lined up in light rain outside a polling place at the Camp Verde Community Library. Thunder rumbled overhead, but most appeared to be in good spirits.\n\nAlana Lewis, 18, was excited to participate in her first election.\n\n“It’s time for a change,” she said, then shrugged. “It’s just a lot of chaos that happened this year and I’ve seen a lot of the president’s true side of who he is and how he runs things.”\n\nStill in high school, she became politically aware with the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, which began in 2016. As a Native American, she said witnessing Trump’s response to the peaceful demonstrations there was eye-opening.\n\n“It’s kind of discriminating. Why do people have to fight for human rights, you know?” she asked.\n\nWhile not their first election, this was the first time Susan and Jerry Bennett came to vote in person. They came because they wanted to participate directly in this historic moment.\n\nThe two retirees came to vote for “democracy, capitalism, not socialism,” they said.\n\nSeveral paces behind, Ron Bennett (unrelated) was less enthused about his choices. He asked with a laugh, “What are the lesser of two evils?”\n\nSeveral people in line around him laughed and nodded in lighthearted disillusionment.\n\n— Emily Wilder\n\n3:15 p.m.: 18 ballots stolen but returned to voters\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office announced that it believes 18 ballots were stolen out of individual mailboxes in Glendale late last week.\n\nIn a statement, the office said a resident found the ballots hidden under a rock near 99th and Glendale avenues and contacted the Glendale Police Department on Friday.\n\nThe Glendale Police Department shared a video of Brayan Ruiz, who said he found the ballots under concrete and rocks while at work at Rovey Farms. He kicked the rocks, saw they said something about elections, took a picture and sent it to his boss, who told him to bring them to the office and then they contacted Glendale police.\n\n\"I really have no information of who could have put them there, or how they got there. All I know is they were there and I took action and returned them to Glendale police,\" Ruiz said.\n\nInvestigators believe the mail-in ballots were stolen from individual mailboxes in a neighborhood just south of 107th and Northern avenues. The envelopes were still sealed.\n\nAttorney General's Office agents and Glendale police officers hand-delivered the ballots back to the registered voters over the weekend.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office said the motive for stealing the ballots is unclear. An investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the incident can submit tips to the Attorney General’s Election Integrity Unit online or email EIU@azag.gov.\n\nVoters can check the status of their ballots on the Arizona Secretary of State’s website.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n3 p.m.: 'A lemonade stand for democracy' in south Phoenix\n\nVolunteers from United Farm Workers — some coming from other states in the West to focus on swing-state Arizona — have been hitting the pavement for months reaching voters in south Phoenix.\n\nOn Tuesday, the culmination of their efforts is a voter information booth at El Reposo Park, the site of the \"Low Ridin' for Biden\" event on Sunday, one of the organization’s last hurrahs to mobilize voters.\n\nOrganizers prepared a single table with treats and water in a cozy south Phoenix neighborhood between Seventh Street and Central Avenue.\n\n“I would say, if anything, it’s a lemonade stand for democracy,” Elizabeth Strater, a UFW volunteer from California, said of the humble table. “Because this is a community that doesn’t feel represented, these are folks that may not know where they’re supposed to vote.”\n\nSo far, a little more than 35 people showed up to ask for information.\n\nCommunities like south Phoenix, which is home to some of the poorest neighborhoods in Phoenix and has the highest Black and Latino populations in the city, are often disproportionately affected by voter disenfranchisement. Often, the community is skeptical of candidates and information just doesn’t reach voters.\n\n“The majority of people do want to be engaged, they just don’t have the tools to be engaged,” said Ernie Flores, a UFW volunteer from Yuma. “There’s no perfect representation, as Cesar Chavez said. There’s no perfect democracy, but there is perfect participation.”\n\nHe said it seems possible that Arizona will turn blue because of its Latino population, if not now, then in the future. He said Trump’s message to Latinos was that he was against them right off the bat, and that encouraged Latino voters to vote against him.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n2:30 p.m.: Maricopa County approaches 100,000 voters\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said voter turnout in the county is in line with what officials expected, with about 99,000 voters casting ballots in person before 1:30 p.m.\n\nThat doesn't include other voters who dropped off their mail-in ballots at the polls.\n\nJordy and Alexis Berrelleza did just that.\n\nThe Phoenix siblings said they wanted to cast their first votes together. After their ballots arrived in the mail, Jordy, 19, walked his sister through the choices, explaining the options as simply as he could.\n\n“In a non-biased way,” he said, grinning under his black mask, but the siblings voted mostly the same way anyway.\n\nBefore Election Day, they thought about mailing in their ballots, but all the noise surrounding the integrity of the election changed their minds.\n\n“We felt like it was more secure to bring it in person,” Jordy said. So together they headed to the offices of the Phoenix Union High School District, where there was a steady stream of voters but no line.\n\nIn the end, Jordy said, they probably didn’t have any reason to worry.\n\n“It would’ve been the same,” he said of mailing in their votes, “because we just dropped it in a box.\"\n\n— Alden Woods and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n2 p.m.: Navajo voters cast ballots\n\nNavajo voters streamed into the Steamboat Chapter House in Steamboat, Arizona, to cast their votes in Apache county.\n\nSeveral election officials paced the grounds, instructing voters which line to stand in. There was a line to vote in Apache County for the national and state election, and a line for local Navajo Nation government elections.\n\nThe voting line for the county moved quickly and the local voting line had build up as more and more people turned out to vote.\n\nElection officials made sure people in line maintained social distancing, kept face masks on and knew about hand-washing stations. They also checked temperatures before voters entered the building.\n\nAndrew Simpson and his wife Bessie Yellowhair-Simpson, from Steamboat in northeastern Arizona, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for family members to arrive from Phoenix. They both voted early by mail, but as community leaders — Andrew is a former council delegate and Bessi is the chapter treasurer — they stick around every Election Day.\n\nBessie, who is up for reelection, said she is use to seeing food stands lined up against the fence to feed voters before they head into the polls, but they couldn’t do that this year. The Navajo Nation Board of Elections sent out a memo before Election Day advising against food stands or political tents due to the pandemic.\n\n“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” he said, and he’s been able to recognize most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”\n\nAndrew feels that both major political parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed that they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.\n\n“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,\" he said. He hopes in a few years it will only get better.\n\n“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Andrew said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”\n\n— Shondiin Silversmith\n\n1:30 p.m.: Advocates say Native American voters see problems at polling sites\n\nVolunteers say they've heard of issues at polling locations in Apache County.\n\nVolunteers with Native Vote said they’ve received reports from Native American voters witnessing problems at polling sites. Patty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights and trains volunteers to monitor polling sites for problems.\n\nShe said they’ve received reports that polling sites in Apache County, including in Chinle and Window Rock, did not open on time this morning. That means some voters may have had to wait or leave if they had to work.\n\nFerguson Bohnee urged voters who experience or witness violations of voting rights to contact the Native Vote hotline at 888-777-3831 so attorneys can document and investigate the complaints.\n\nFurther south, three members of the Arizona State University's Indigenous pageant royalty supported the Native Vote at Bapchule, a community in the Gila River Indian Community.\n\nMiss Indigenous ASU Lourdes Pereira is a member of the federally recognized Hia-Ced O'odham but is enrolled at Tohono O'odham Nation. Pereira, a double major in American Indian and justice studies, said that one issue important to her is ensuring Native people can access ballots and return them from remote tribal communities while avoiding COVID-19 exposure.\n\nThe tribe instituted drive-thru voting, which First Attendant Jolene Fernandez said was a boon for elders, because it kept them from close contact with poll workers.\n\nThe tribe was also conducting its own election for council and an initiative to change the tribal constitution in regards to tribal membership.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez, Debra Utacia Krol\n\n12:45 p.m.: Lines still long in Scottsdale, issues in Tucson\n\nLines in Old Town Scottsdale started growing shortly after the polling place at the Old Town venue Mini Social opened for voting Tuesday morning.\n\nBy the afternoon, the Maricopa County Recorder's Office website showed there were still dozens of people in line and wait times stretched upward of 20 minutes.\n\nLines at polling places across the Valley have moved smoothly throughout the late morning and early afternoon. Dozens of locations listed on the county recorder's website showed wait times between zero and 10 minutes.\n\nVolunteers say the police were called in Tucson on a man trying to influence voters to reelect President Donald Trump outside the Miller-Golf Links Library.\n\nRoger Dean, a registered Democrat, has been outside of the polling site since 7 a.m. with a sign that reads \"Democrats for Trump.\"\n\n“Two police officers showed up,” Dean said. “They had complaints of me standing here (intimidating) people.”\n\nHe added that he is allowed to be at the polling site as long as he is at the 75 feet marker.\n\nLeo Kresch, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Tucson, said she has also been at this polling location all day, and was there when the police were called.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Joshua Bowling\n\nNoon: Volunteers offer resources ahead of potential lunch rush\n\nVolunteers stood outside Valley polling places Tuesday morning as they waited for a potential surge of voters during the lunch hour.\n\nPromise Arizona was on-site at Mountain Park Health Center encouraging people to get out the vote. Some arrived in a white pickup adorned with red and blue streamers, American flags and \"Vote!\" written along the door.\n\nVolunteers and employees held banners in English and Spanish with the messages \"Vote today\" and \"Sí se puede.\"\n\n\"We are making sure voters are supported when they come cast their vote and if we see anything suspicious or anything that’s out of place we will help them and provide guidance,\" Manuel Gutierrez with Promise Arizona said.\n\nIn northwest Phoenix near 35th and Northern avenues, dozens of members of Unite Here Local 11, a labor union that represents 33,000 hotel and food service workers in southern California and Arizona, fanned out into the neighborhoods for one final day of knocking on doors.\n\n\"This is the day we are going to turn Arizona blue,\" Alex Sandoval, a Unite Here organizer and campaign field director, told the group before sending them out into the field.\n\nVoting-rights advocates said that in an election with historic turnout, voters who don’t speak English or experience other barriers to voting may struggle to reach help when they believe their rights are being violated. Chris Gilfillan, a director with the Arizona Center for Empowerment and Living United for Change in Arizona, was working with voter protection groups providing support in Spanish and other languages.\n\n\"Anyone can help reporting voting flags (problems) using the incident reporting form,\" he said.\n\nPatty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights. She urged people who experience or witness problems for Native American voters to call the Native Vote hotline or reach out to volunteers at polling sites.\n\nArizona political parties have provided hotlines to assist voters who only feel comfortable seeking help for potential violations from someone with their party of preference.\n\nVoter-assistance hotlines:\n\nNALEO ¡Ve y Vota!

Náñez, Megan Taros, Daniel Gonzalez\n\n11:30 a.m.: Religious polling places in the East Valley\n\nThe Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley in Scottsdale was one of two mosques serving as a polling location in Maricopa County this year. Around 40 people formed a line outside the mosque early in the day, but the line started moving quickly.\n\nVoter Cat Splete said it took her about a minute total to drop off her ballot. This is Splete’s first time voting in a presidential election. Climate justice is the key issue that moved her to vote, she said.\n\n“It goes into the environmental humanities — those who live in minority communities are always going to bear the brunt of those negative environmental factors,\" she said.\n\nMany voters at the center were not Muslim. That's because Muslims were encouraged to vote early this year, according to Ahmed Soussi, the interim director for the Council of American-Islamic Relation’s Arizona chapter.\n\nCAIR is a part of the One Arizona, a coalition that mobilizes and educates voters from marginalized communities. One Arizona said on Twitter they registered about 185,000 voters this year.\n\nThe Sun Lakes United Methodist Church in Chandler did not see large crowds Tuesday morning.\n\nTwo woman, who dubbed themselves “The Two Phyllises”, have spent the morning handing out fliers that they made for Republicans to help them narrow down their votes.\n\nPhyllis Lester, who already submitted her early ballot, said she came up with the idea for the fliers when she and her husband realized how many judges there were to choose from on their ballot this election.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy, Kelly Donohue\n\n11 a.m.: Complaint of man in Trump mask yelling at voters\n\nThere was a complaint Tuesday morning of a man yelling at Scottsdale voters.\n\nJohn Ainlay, a prescient committee member for Legislative District 23, said a man in a Trump mask yelled at voters as they went to cast their ballots around 9 a.m. at Florence Ely Nelson Desert Park in north Scottsdale.\n\nThe man allegedly yelled things like \"baby killers\" and \"stop stealing my taxes.\" Ainlay said a woman from the Arizona Republican Party threatened to call the police on the man if he continued. He quieted down but remained at the voting site, Ainlay said.\n\nNonpartisan volunteers at the site said they were not able to remove him because he was outside the allowed 75 foot boundary, but they expressed concern over his presence and attempts to intimidate voters.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy\n\n10:30 a.m.: Smooth voting in Tucson, Cordes Lakes\n\nEstevan Puentes, a 39-year-old south Tucson resident, came out to vote with his family Tuesday morning.\n\nHis mother only speaks and reads in Spanish. That can be a problem when polling sites do not have any Spanish speakers or ballots that she can understand, Puentes said.\n\nHe brought his son and nephew who are first-time voters, as well as his sister to make sure his family’s votes were counted this election. They were able to get in and out quickly as there was no sizable line at the polling place.\n\nIn Cordes Lakes, a turn off Interstate 17 on the drive to northern Arizona, voters weren't blocked by long lines either.\n\nThe Cordes Lakes Community Center had a short line, people were mostly masked and many donned pro-Trump paraphernalia. A steady flow of cars ambled in and out of the gravel parking lot. Tranquil and quiet under expansive clouded skies, it was hard to believe people were there to cast their votes in the explosive 2020 presidential election.\n\nAround 9:45 a.m., it began to rain, but people still stood dutifully outside.\n\nRandy Rogers and Angie McFadin emerged from their white truck. Issues about the border and health care brought both to the polls near their home.\n\n“I don’t like our two candidates, I’ll say that. I’m not a fan of either one of them,” Rogers said, walking toward the line stretching from the doorway of the one-story community center. “I was a Trump supporter last time because I liked what he had to say, and I’m definitely not a Democrat. Republicans want to take everything and Democrats want to give everything away.”\n\nUnlike 2016, he said he isn’t voting for Trump in this election. For the first time in his life, he’s casting his vote for the third-party candidate on the ballot, Jo Jorgensen.\n\nThe change was largely due to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger said. The infection had swept through his sister-in-law’s entire family.\n\n“For me, I can’t vote for these two guys with a clear conscience,” he aid.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Emily Wilder\n\n10:15 a.m.: Rain in Gilbert, lines in Scottsdale\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had to close its doors and people made a dash for the dry interiors of their cars as rain came down in Gilbert.\n\nRecent ASU graduate Cameryn Baum stood outside of the Higley Road polling station with her cello this morning. She hoped to inspire more people to head inside and vote.\n\nBaum said she is participating in the nationwide Play for the Vote campaign, which is organizing musical performances throughout the country during Election Day to provide a positive incentive for people to head to the polls.\n\nIn Old Town Scottsdale, lines were long.\n\nEarlier in the morning, more than 100 people waited in line to vote outside Mini Social, a multi-use events venue in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nThe line of voters curved and winded around the store fronts of Fifth Avenue. Some people walking up to vote expressed sighs of frustration.\n\nScottsdale City Council candidate Betty Janik was making her way steadily through the line at 8 a.m., talking to voters about issues and answering their remaining questions about the candidates.\n\nBy 9 a.m. a volunteer had come outside to tell voters that there were several polling locations within four to six miles of Mini Social that had no wait times.\n\nMinutes later, there were roughly 80 people in line with a wait time of 20 minutes.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Lorraine Longhi\n\n9:45 a.m.: 'Hope that people are going to come together'\n\nVoters were largely optimistic at the Southern Plaza voting center in south Phoenix.\n\nMany emphasized the importance of the vote particularly in this tense and chaotic year, especially as Arizona stands on the precipice of historic change.\n\n“If anything if Arizona stays Trump but then turns blue it’s going to be an interesting time in the country,” said voter Sentari Minor as he left the polling center.\n\nThe atmosphere was friendly as political opponents and compatriots appealed to voters outside the center. Mia Hill, another voter at the center, said that despite tension leading in to the election that the outcome must be a call to unity.\n\n\"It was important to me that I bought and contribute to a positive future,\" Hill said. \"The fear of negative things happening, I think that’s all it is, is fear. I have hope that people are going to come together more than everything.\"\n\nJesus Olvera has children in school in south Phoenix. For him, the school board race was most important for his children’s future — but all the votes he cast were laying a foundation for them, he said.\n\nHe and other voters agreed the climate is ripe for change.\n\n\"I think there’s going to be a big change. I don’t know if it’s going to bring the results but it’s going to be a good time for us,\" Olvera said.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n9:30 a.m.: Rep. Debbie Lesko alleges 'bias' at polling location\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko tweeted on Tuesday morning that a county poll worker in Sun City moved polling lines without measuring them and told Lesko she had to leave.\n\nLesko tweeted that she was at Radiant Church Sun City, near 107th Avenue and Boswell Bouelvard, when this happened.\n\n\"This is what's typical of some people that are biased,\" Lesko said in the video. \"And it's wrong.\"\n\nMegan Gilbertson, a spokesperson for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said workers at the site mistakenly thought it was a non-electioneering site. In Arizona, people aren't allowed to campaign or solicit votes within 75 feet of the polling place.\n\nThe location used to be one, but this year is not, Gilbertson said. The department addressed the mistake with the workers and Lesko, she said.\n\n— Joshua Bowling\n\n9:15 a.m.: First-time voters in the Ak-Chin Indian Community\n\nAk-Chin Indian Community had a quiet morning as people prepared for the day.\n\nBut at the tribe's community service center, slow but steady numbers of vehicles pull in as tribal members and community residents of the tribe exercise their right to vote.\n\nSamantha Alejandro is married to an Ak-Chin tribal member. The mother of three arrived early to cast her vote. She said she is concerned with how fast the racial climate has changed. The first-time voter said she voted for Biden and Harris.\n\n\"I'm for peace,\" she said. \"And we need to take steps to get there.\"\n\nAnother first-time voter had a different take.\n\n\"The way the president has handled the pandemic has been a disaster,\" said Jose Batopis III, 28.\n\nBatopis, who's enrolled in the Yavapai-Apache Nation and also has Yaqui and Tohono O'odham heritage, lives in Ak-Chin and has lost an uncle, great-uncle and his grandfather to the coronavirus. He, too, voted for the Biden-Harris ticket. \"They will take the country in a better direction,\" Batopis said.\n\nFormer tribal chairman and Elder Terry Enos has heard many candidate's promises for Indian Country.\n\n\"The president said he do a lot of things and did a 180 instead,\" Enos said. \"Trump just doesn't get it.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Enos said that Biden walks softly but carries a big stick. He's not sure what will happen after the long count but still will urge his kids to come cast their vote.\n\nVolunteers for Native Vote, a nationwide initiative that supports voting and deals with voting issues, were on hand for any problems. Anna Marie Smith and Annalise Parady came armed with brochures, information on the Native Vote Hotline for any problems and lots of water and snacks for the day.\n\n— Debra Utacia Krol\n\n9 a.m.: Mayoral races in Phoenix, Scottsdale and Gilbert\n\nPhoenix's three-way race between incumbent Kate Gallego, Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay is a primary election, meaning a candidate must get more than 50% of the vote to win outright on Tuesday. Otherwise, the race goes to a runoff between the top two vote-getters in March.\n\nBoth Scottsdale and Gilbert follow the more traditional election cycle in which the primary was held in August. Tuesday's runoff mayoral races feature Lisa Borowsky and David Ortega in Scottsdale and Matt Nielsen and Brigette Peterson in Gilbert.\n\nBoth Phoenix and Scottsdale have council races on the ballot, too.\n\nThe Scottsdale runoff features six candidates for three seats.\n\nThe Phoenix primary has contested races in the four council districts on the ballot. The most crowded race is in District 7, where five candidates vie to replace term-limited Michael Nowakowski representing parts of south, west and downtown Phoenix.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Lines dwindle in Gilbert, West Valley\n\nAs lines at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert shortened after a busy morning, voters were able to get in and out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Higley Road.\n\nVeronica Parrillo, a first time nonpartisan volunteer, sat outside the polling place all morning to answer general questions that voters may have.\n\nShe said that the line had been moving pretty steadily.\n\n\"The longest I saw the line get was just over 20 minutes,\" Parillo said, adding that she expects more of a rush around lunchtime and later in the evening.\n\nIn Sun City West, lines had been virtually nonexistent since just after 6 a.m. Voters came by steadily but didn't have to wait in line.\n\nCarolyn Gelazela volunteered to watch the polling location at the R.H. Johnson Recreation Center. Before she left her home Tuesday morning, her daughter reminded her to take her vitamins and told her not to be afraid of COVID-19.\n\nThe recreation center requires voters inside to wear a face covering. Most voters who came by Tuesday morning wore a face mask or other covering.\n\n\"I'm not a big believer in this whole pandemic thing. People are dying, but people die,\" Gelazela said, adding that she hopes for Republican victories as election results come in.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Adrienne Dunn\n\n8 a.m.: McSally-Kelly Senate race captures eyes of the nation\n\nThe winner of the Arizona race to fill the seat initially won by the late Sen. John McCain could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., and Mark Kelly, the Democratic challenger, fought hard in a high-profile, high-dollar race.\n\nMcSally, a former Air Force combat pilot, crisscrossed the state by plane on Sunday and Monday to visit 11 cities from Yuma to Kingman.\n\nRecent polling suggests Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut, continues to lead in the race in the final days.\n\nThe winner likely will be on the ballot again in 2022; that's when McCain's term expires.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n7:30 a.m.: Some voters see lines\n\nEric Kurland, a Democrat running for Arizona House of Representatives in Legislative District 23, visited the Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley in Scottsdale on Tuesday morning.\n\nKurland, a teacher, was clad in a T-shirt for his campaign and a face mask with symbols of education: sharpened pencils and bright red apples.\n\n“I am just stunned by the amount of people that showed up this early for a vote that mostly everybody has already cast,” he said.\n\nIn Gilbert, Nicole Moon has been waiting in line to vote since 6:15 a.m. Tuesday. Moon, who works in communications, was still standing in line at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert shortly after 7 a.m.\n\nShe said she's concerned about unrest across the United States, no matter what the election results are.\n\n\"I think there's going to be a big political mess and probably some legal challenges,\" Moon said.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy, Kelly Donohue\n\n7 a.m.: Arizona is a battleground state this year. Here's why\n\nArizona is a magnet for transplants from across the country and has a large, Democratic-leaning Hispanic population that voted in more sizable numbers in 2018.\n\nAlong with a large independent electorate that swung mostly to Democrats two years ago, these factors helped push the state — once the base of GOP presidential nominees Barry Goldwater and John McCain — to battleground status.\n\nGrowing signs indicate these demographic trends could make it harder for President Donald Trump to hold on to a state he carried by 3.5% points in 2016. Recent polls show Biden in the lead.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:30 a.m.: Voters waited for polling places to open\n\nA steady stream of voters lined up early at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert.\n\nDozens were already waiting outside before the polling place opened at 6 a.m. The line grew and stretched into the parking lot within 30 minutes .\n\nVoters were mostly masked and socially distanced as they waited to go inside and cast their votes.\n\nAcross the Valley in Sun City West, a short but steady stream of voters made their way into the active adult community's R.H. Johnson Recreation Center.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Adrienne Dunn\n\n6 a.m.: Arizona polls open for historic 2020 election\n\nPolling places are in new locations this election, and Maricopa County voters can cast a ballot at any polling place, now called vote centers, rather than at an assigned polling place. COVID-19 precautions are in place. Masks are available to voters who did not bring them.\n\nVote centers, ballot drop boxes and drive-thru drop boxes will be open from 6 a.m. until polls close at 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nLocations for drop boxes and vote centers can be found at locations.maricopa.vote or by calling 602-506-1511.\n\nFor voters who:\n\nGot a ballot in the mail but didn't send it back yet: Drop it off at any drop box or vote center.\n\nGot a ballot in the mail but misplaced it: Get a new one at any vote center.\n\nWant to vote in person: Go to any vote center. See here for what you should bring.\n\nOverall, voting has gone smoothly since the county began opening vote centers and mailing out ballots on Oct. 7. By about noon Monday, the county had processed ballots for about 64.4% of the county's registered voters. That's about 1.68 million ballots out of 2.61 million registered voters.\n\nBy Sunday, early voting in the county had already surpassed total voting in 2016.\n\n— Jen Fifield", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}]}

Later, they named Jeff Saturday, a Colts legend with no NFL or college coaching experience, as his interim replacement.\n\nColts owner Jim Irsay, general manager Chris Ballard and Saturday addressed the media on Monday night.\n\nHere's what they said:\n\nJim Irsay:\n\n\"We certainly are excited about going forward with our future. First and foremost, a big thank you to Frank Reich. He's someone that's very close tot he organization, to my family, to myself, to Chris, to Jeff. It's a very difficult and tough day. I told Frank I was hoping Chris and him and I were going to grab that Lombardi trophy someday. This league is tough and things change. He's a pro. he understands this league and this business. It was a difficult decision to make ... There's no rulebook that tells you, 'Now you should make a change, now you shouldn't.' It's intuitive.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\n\"I've been fortunate and blessed on the path of bringing in coaches. Chris and I met Sunday night face to face in a difficult conversation ... Expectations are high here. We've earned (winning). What we've accomplished speaks for itself. I told Frank that expectations are high. He's a winning head coach. If anyone wants to diminish what Coach did, you'd be wrong. The numbers don't lie. You are what your record is. But it was time.\"\n\nIrsay on Jeff Saturday: Yes, he is fully experienced enough. He's capable. He's extremely smart and competitive ... You want to bet against this guy? Put your money down people. I know what he's about.\n\nIrsay on Saturday's experience: Yes, there's a maturation curve. No, the game is not different. We don't build rockets to go to Mars. It's a very simple job we do here. We cultivate winning cultures. We don't expect anything more than we expect from ourselves. I'm not going to ask someone to do something I haven't done. I know who we are. I know where we're going.\n\nI know people can look out and see it and ask (the experience) question. I understand. I don't know how to make sausage, but I do know how to build a football team. He's fully capable of doing this. It wasn't offered to anyone else. I don;'t know what Chris and I would have done if he wasn't available and willing.\n\nIrsay on Saturday's future: Yes, it's an interim coaching job. it lines up with the Rooney Rule. After the season, there will be a full process for interviewing. This is for eight games, hopefully more. All I'm thinking about is the Raiders ... There's no talk of permanence at this point.\n\nIrsay on other candidates: I wanted a winning coach, a winning playoff coach that was proven. Now, I'm glad he doesn't have NFL experience and that he hasn't learned the fear that's in this league. There was no other candidate. We were fortunate he was available. He has tons of experience.\n\nIrsay on why it was time to make a change: You never like to make a change, much less during the season. It's not ideal. Chris and I saw things collapse. I saw things go from bad to worse. I thought it was time to make a change.\n\nIrsay on Ballard: Chris was highly sought after. The guy's a winner and he's been immensely successful. In this league, it's tough. Sometimes you don't understand how fortunate you are when you're around success. He fits right into that culture.\n\nIrsay said \"of course\" Ballard will be back next season.\n\nWe're fortunate to have him. These things don't always work out in our favor. We know things have drifted. Sometimes that happens in this game. The math doesn't always work in this league. From my perspective, we're fortunate to have Chris.\n\nYou try to get the right mixture going at the right time. We're fortunate to have this guy. We know it's about winning. There's a lot to consider before we'd make a change (at general manager)\n\nIrsay on decision to move on from Reich: Chris knows you keep names in your pocket, but you're always ready for anything to happen within your own coaching staff, within the league, in college. You have to. Believe me, it was a debate society. We're all trying to strive for the right thing. I stay open-minded.\n\nIrsay on choosing Saturday over other coaches with experience: He's a better fit (than assistants with previous experience). He's the best man for the job, and there's no question about it in my mind. I've been around it a long time. He's extremely tough and he's a leader. You have to be a great thinker, work with people, be open-minded, create a culture where people trust you. You have to have experience, draw on experience in your life. You know it when you see it. Let's be clear, this thing was driven by what Chris and I see in his excellence and readiness and who he is.\n\nOPINION:Colts hiring Jeff Saturday as interim head coach is slap in the face of Black coaches\n\nOPINION:If Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich had to go, and he did, so does GM Chris Ballard\n\n4th & MONDAY:Our NFL newsletter always brings the blitz\n\nJeff Saturday:\n\nSaturday has met with the offensive staff. \"There are fantastic coaches on this staff and men who have done this a long time. I have no fear I will pick the right guy (for offensive coordinator) and we will ride with it.\n\nSaturday on reaction when he was offered the job: Shock would be an understatement. We had the conversation and it escalated quickly. He asked me and my wife. He told me he was going to meet with Chris about it. As the day progressed, we finally came to a conclusion. It was a 12-hour whirlwind. It was a late call.\n\nI feel fully capable, excited about the opportunity. If it goes well, hopefully it will go extremely well ... The job is win. This is an audition for this job and 31 other jobs.\n\nI'd be shocked as well. I'll be frank, I asked Mr. Irsay, 'Tell me why I'm a candidate you'd consider in any role to do this.' I felt very prepared. When Peyton retired from Denver, I spent some time with John Lynch ... Every year, I've done a sheet of the best OCs, the best DCs, who you want in that building.\n\nIrsay said Saturday's \"leadership\" set him apart. \"I've been with Hall of Famers. I've seen great leadership at its pinnacle. I'm a leader of men. I don't shy away from it and I'm excited about it.\"\n\nSaturday said Sam Ehlinger will be QB on Sunday.\n\nI am who I am. I don't change. I'm probably more spirited than most. I'll hold people accountable. I'm going to be your toughest critic and your biggest cheerleader.\n\nSaturday said he'll have to win over the locker room. \"You've to earn your place here. We're all on a trial basis. Only one guy up here is secure, and he's in the middle. I hope they understand the expectation I have for them is no different than the expectations I have for myself. I've spent my life in a locker room. If they see I'm authentic, we'll do just fine.\"\n\nChris Ballard:\n\nAfter the game, Irsay and I visited. It was spirited. Last night, we talked about jeff. We've tried to hire Jeff a couple times in 2019 as the offensive line coach and again this year. The timing didn't work out ... He's got real leadership in him. Real special in that regard. For this eight game stretch, we thought it was going to be a good fit for us.\n\nWe’ve got eight games left. I’m not ready to throw in the towel. I talked to the team and the coaches. Frank, Jim and I met about the Ryan decision. We had a long talk late last night. I talked to Frank this morning.\n\nWe both know we haven’t been perfect in any stretch. It was a hard morning.\n\nDefensively, we’re playing pretty good football. Offensively, we’ve got to make some hay.

What is ...", "text": "The past week has been quite a year on the Colts beat.\n\nOn Monday morning, I woke up at 5:30 a.m. in a hotel in Boston and headed for the airport. I got back home in Indianapolis at 11:30 that morning, sat down to do a little work and got the news that Frank Reich had been fired. Then came the bombshell that Jeff Saturday would replace him.\n\nThen came a wild press conference that night.\n\nI finally got to bed at 3 a.m. I've had some crazy days in this field, from seeing the Big Ten Tournament canceled to a Lions practice in a blizzard to a Lions coach's press conference discussing an allegation for sexual assault, but Monday had to be the strangest from start to finish.\n\nIt's never a dull day covering these 2022 Colts. It also means you have questions, and I tried my best to deliver some answers.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\n(If you'd like to submit a mailbag question, email the link at the bottom or follow me on Twitter @NateAtkins_, where I put out the call.)\n\nQuestion: \"Jeff Saturday was a head-scratching decision, to say the least. How will that affect the Colts head coach search in the offseason? Would Sean Payton have any interest in coaching the Colts after this? He have said he doesn't want to go to a dysfunctional place and the Colts seems to be one.\" -- @_Not_DBCooper via Twitter\n\nAnswer: The Colts are making so many changes right now that it can be hard to keep track of. In less than three weeks, they have benched an MVP quarterback for a sixth-round pick, they've fired an offensive coordinator, they've fired a head coach and offensive play caller and they've hired an interim coach from an analyst job at ESPN.\n\nThey are doing it to best manage and react to a season that has fallen so far below anyone's expectations, but they have to be careful about the image this projects around the league. The nation tuned in for Monday's press conference with popcorn. My phone was blowing up with people asking what on earth had infected this franchise. It's undercutting all the stability and infrastructure that had made it a prized destination for a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback like Matt Ryan just eight months ago. Jim Irsay now comes off as an owner calling the shots, particularly with his quarterbacks, to the point of hiring a former player he likes in order to smooth it over. Whether that's fair or not, it's the perception they have to fight. It's an image of meddling that has made franchises like the Browns, Raiders, Jets, Dolphins and Washington what they have been over the past few decades.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS: Jeff Saturday is an unconventional hire. Can he become a rare success with Colts?\n\nThat doesn't bode well for negotiations with future head coaches or general managers who have other options. Sean Payton will certainly be one of those, and he comes from a place in New Orleans where he had total roster control, something that's not on the table with the Colts right now. Payton is a longshot for other reasons, too: He will prioritize having a quarterback in place, and he'll also cost significant draft compensation to the Saints. The Colts need their draft picks to find a quarterback and a left tackle to attract him in the first place.\n\nAlso, consider the words he told The Athletic recently:\n\n\"I think there are a lot of dysfunctional teams in our league. There are some places where talent can die,\" Payton said. \"I just want to avoid those places.\"\n\nQuestion: \"Why is Jimmy from the Colts the way that he is? But seriously, what the hell was that press conference? Irsay was so smug and arrogant while Ballard looked like he’d rather be anywhere but there. Embarrassed as a fan/season ticket holder is an understatement.\" -- @MitchMullis via Twitter\n\nAnswer: That was a trip. So much surprised me about the Colts' approach that night -- the lack of an opening statement for Saturday or Chris Ballard, Irsay's opening defense of the coach he just fired, the deflection of criticism, the bathing in the success of the early 2000s and the refusal to acknowledge what's changed.\n\nPerhaps the weirdest moment to me was one I haven't seen get a lot of play elsewhere: when Irsay made up a reference from a deceased Al Davis to promote his new coach.\n\n\"If Al was here and you’d say, ‘Hey Al, why do you think Jeff (Saturday) is going to be successful?’ He’d say three words: ‘He’s not scared,’” Irsay said.\n\nThe defensiveness of Irsay and Ballard caught me by surprise. Ballard thrives on confidence, but it doesn't usually rear its head after failure. Irsay has always been engaging and relatable to the fans' frustration, but the night became a victory lap for his tenure, when it was the mistakes that led to the press conference for a fired coach. It all took the focus off of Saturday, a franchise legend who showed a relatable and passionate personality but was overshadowed by the leaders above him. That's becoming a theme of the 2022 Colts.\n\nThis was Ballard and Irsay in a place we haven't seen them before. Both men have proven to me and others to be much better than they showed that night. You hope they can rebound to what they used to be instead of just talking about what they used to be.\n\nQuestion: \"What changes will be made to improve line play and the offense in general?\" -- @chuckinfoosier via Twitter\n\nAnswer: Saturday is going to need some time to assess the situation before too many changes take place.\n\nHe gave some interesting insight in his first solo press conference Wednesday when he shared that Irsay called him in the middle of Sunday's 26-3 loss to the Patriots to ask what was so wrong with an offensive line that would go on to give up nine sacks, their most since 2017.\n\n\"I was not watching that game. I was preparing to go to work. So, I was watching all the other games. I actually watched the Colts at 7 – my schedule for working for ESPN,\" Saturday said. \"... This was 100% about what happened to our o-line and that was the role that I had been doing with Strauss (Chris Strausser) and Frank (Reich).\"\n\nEverything has been a whirlwind for Saturday since that call. He discussed the opportunity with his wife, accepted the job, flew from Georgia to Indianapolis, met his coaching staff for the first time, interviewed offensive coaches to find a play-caller, met with the team, met with trainers to learn about the health situation of the 53 men on the roster and then started to formulate a practice plan.\n\n\"I’m drinking from a fire hydrant a little bit,\" Saturday said.\n\nWhat we do know is that Sam Ehlinger will start at quarterback, Bernhard Raimann will start at left tackle and assistant quarterbacks coach Parks Frazier will call the plays. Ehlinger has started the past two games and Raimann started last week. Frazier has never called plays at any level before, but he's as on top of the details of Reich's playbook and philosophy as anyone and has worked with Ehlinger behind the scenes. His knowledge of what Ehlinger can and can't do should be a bonus, but he has catching up to do with the rest of the personnel.\n\nLike any coaching staff, they'll adapt some as they gain practice time and see the picture evolve on the field. They'll also work with what they have. The real fixes the Colts need on offense aren't walking through that door right now. The players and coaches are all so young and inexperienced everywhere but the offensive line, and that's been the unit that has held everything back.\n\nQuestion: \"If they miss playoffs, you think Chris Ballard is done in offseason so new GM can pick his own coach?\" -- @MIKE_R_MARSHALL via Twitter\n\nAnswer: It's going to be very unlikely that the Colts make the playoffs with the changes they've introduced to a 3-5-1 team. Projecting beyond that gets very difficult.\n\nIrsay was asked on Monday whether Ballard will be back, an admittedly awkward but unavoidable moment with Ballard sitting directly to his left.\n\n\"There’s no question about that,\" Irsay said. \"Honestly, it’s not really even in the consciousness of my mind about that sort of thing.\"\n\nIt's a vote of confidence, technically. But keep in mind Irsay's track record with these promises. He said last spring that Ryan would be the starting quarterback for at least two seasons and hopefully a third, and that lasted seven games. He recently told ESPN and NFL Network that Reich's job was safe, and that lasted eight days.\n\nI brought those two moments to his attention Monday night and asked him why fans should believe the promises he's now making about his head coach and general manager.\n\n“I’ve never hired a losing head coach,\" Irsay said. \"We’re the fourth-winningest team in the league. It’s not about belief, it’s about fact. What we’ve done. We’re better than most all. It’s that simple. Our record proves it over a period of time. So, you don’t have to believe much when it’s there in black and white.\"\n\nSo, the track record suggests the words aren't what matters. Irsay says he makes these decisions based on intuition, so we'll see how he feels about the final eight games and what Saturday reports back to him about the state of his franchise.\n\nQuestion: \"Is this the year the Colts finally go and draft a QB in the first round regardless of whatever draft position they end up in?\" -- @AarBagg via Twitter\n\nAnswer: It certainly should be, but you really can't assume anything with this franchise at the moment. If they have a plan in place, they're doing a great job of hiding it, and they also seem ripe to blow it up at any moment. Nobody knows who will be the general manager of this team come next spring, so projecting what will happen is impossible.\n\nBut we know Irsay wants to build around a young quarterback, something he pressed upon our columnist, Gregg Doyel, just a week ago.\n\nThey might not have much of a choice either.\n\nThe tenures with Matt Ryan and Nick Foles have gone so publicly bad that it's going to be a monstrous challenge to convince another veteran quarterback to want to make Indianapolis the destination if he has any options at all. Ryan and Foles both did. The Colts had to talk Ryan into requesting a trade from Atlanta to Indianapolis by selling him on their offensive line and running game and promising at least two years as the starter, claims that Irsay made public with his comments and by guaranteeing the second year of Ryan's deal, and they pulled the rug out after seven games. Foles was content with retiring after playing for five teams in 11 seasons. Both men didn't want to move young families across the country unless it was for more than a year, and the Colts promised them both that, and then neither had a chance at the roles they were given by midseason, and the coach who sold them on it was fired.\n\nThat's one of the issues the Colts are having with their chaotic management of this season. The franchise has gone from a golden destination for quarterbacks to a death trap in the eyes of the public. Add in the poor offensive line play and the lack of defined leadership at the general manager, head coach and offensive coordinator level, and it's not the stable place veteran quarterbacks seek out. It's also not a stable place for a rookie either, but draft picks don't get the same choice.\n\nWhat the Colts do from now until next year's draft will determine plenty about whether the next quarterback can sink or swim.\n\nContact Colts insider Nate Atkins at natkins@indystar.com.

Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have submitted requests to the FDA to get their shots authorized for emergency use in younger children, but it's unclear when they'll become available.\n\nWhat does bivalent mean?\n\nAnswer: Bivalent boosters combine the original COVID-19 vaccine with a reformulation that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 versions of the omicron variant.\n\nBoth the original COVID-19 vaccines and the updated bivalent boosters use messenger RNA technology.\n\nIn the original vaccines, mRNA instructs body’s cells to produce spike proteins similar to those on the surface of the original coronavirus. The immune system recognizes those vaccine-created spike proteins as invaders and creates antibodies to block future attacks of the real virus.\n\nThe bivalent booster combines the original vaccine and a reformulation targeting a mutated spike protein found on the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, so the immune system can create antibodies that combat both the original coronavirus and the omicron variants.\n\nThe BA.5 strain is the predominant variant circulating the country, making up more than 85% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to the CDC.\n\nWhen should I get a bivalent COVID booster?\n\nAnswer: Now.\n\nWhite House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said everyone should get their bivalent booster shot by Oct. 31. But with fall in full swing, health experts are urging Americans not to wait, as they expect coronavirus cases to rise in the coming months.\n\n“I am recommending anyone that asks me to get it as soon as they can,” said Libby Richards, associate professor of nursing at Purdue University’s College of Health and Human Sciences. “It takes two weeks for the body to start to develop antibodies, meaning it takes two weeks for you to gain protections against the new COVID variant.”\n\nHealth experts say immunity from the bivalent booster should carry through the holiday season, which will not only protect the person getting vaccinated, but also vulnerable loved ones during family gatherings.\n\nHow to find a booster shot near me\n\nAnswer: Vaccines.gov.\n\nMajor pharmacy retailers like CVS and Walgreens say they're offering both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccines, depending on the location. Both companies say they welcome walk-ins, but encourage patients to schedule an appointment online.\n\nThe Biden administration also urges Americans to take advantage of its vaccine locator website, vaccines.gov. By entering your ZIP code, you can find a list of sites where their preferred vaccine is available.\n\nI just recovered from COVID. Should I wait to get boosted?\n\nAnswer: People who have recently recovered from COVID-19 should still get boosted, experts say, as data suggests immunity from prior infection may not be as protective as vaccine-induced immunity.\n\nA 2021 study from the CDC found people were over five times more likely to get COVID-19 three to six months after a prior infection if they were unvaccinated, compared with those who were fully vaccinated and were never infected.\n\nOther studies have also shown vaccination after a COVID-19 infection may offer broader protection, leading to a hybrid or \"super immunity,\" experts say.\n\n“You probably have some protection for some amount of time, in the order of weeks to months,” said Dr. David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “But there’s really good immunology data saying that after an infection, taking a vaccine really locks in that high level of antibody immunity.”\n\nShould I get Moderna or Pfizer? Can I mix and match?\n\nAnswer: Get whatever bivalent booster shot is available, experts say.\n\nPfizer and Moderna's bivalent booster both use mRNA technology combining the original COVID-19 vaccine along with the reformulation targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 versions of the omicron variant.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech: The companies' bivalent booster is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration at 30 micrograms to anyone 12 years old and older at least two months after any previous COVID-19 shots\n\nThe companies' bivalent booster is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration at 30 micrograms to anyone 12 years old and older at least two months after any previous COVID-19 shots Moderna: The FDA authorized Moderna's bivalent booster at 50 micrograms for adults 18 and older.\n\nCDC guidance says FDA-authorized boosters can be mixed and matched after completing a primary series. Those who have gotten Pfizer boosters in the past can get Moderna’s bivalent booster, and vice versa.\n\nIs the bivalent booster shot safe? What are the side effects?\n\nAnswer: Clinical trials in people have yet to be completed, but health experts say there are no safety concerns with the bivalent booster. The FDA said study participants who received the bivalent vaccine reported some side effects like pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain.\n\nAlthough there's limited data, health experts agree the new boosters are safe and will provide broader protection against omicron variants.\n\nFDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said that if the agency waited until studies were completed in another month or two, \"the (COVID) wave will have passed us by and the damage will have been done. ... We have to be a step ahead, or at least we have to try to be.\"\n\nBoosters for kids:Pfizer-BioNTech asks FDA to authorize new omicron-targeting COVID booster for children 5 to 11\n\nCan I get the flu shot and the bivalent booster at the same time?\n\nAnswer: Yes!\n\nAs the country enters flu season, health officials are encouraging Americans to get their flu shot and COVID-19 booster in the same visit.\n\n\"I really believe this is why God gave us two arms,\" Jha said during a White House briefing. \"One for the flu shot and the other for the COVID shot.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub, USA TODAY.

The committee said it could increase protection against the disease that is killing on average 1,093 Americans a day.\n\n\"The evidence shows that all three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States are safe – as demonstrated by the over 400 million vaccine doses already given. And, they are all highly effective in reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.\n\nWalenskey also endorsed a second shot for all 15 millions Americans who received the one-dose J&J vaccine, as well as a booster dose for certain groups of people who got the Moderna vaccine.\n\nDo you need another shot? Can you mix and match vaccines? COVID booster questions, answered.\n\nThe advisory committee made its decisions based on data presented by the vaccine makers and a National Institutes of Health study. It also considered the endorsement of similar recommendations Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nA booster of the Moderna vaccine was recommended at least six months after people get their second shot, but only for those 65 and older or 18 and older if they're at high risk for severe COVID-19, or their jobs or living conditions put them at high risk of exposure to the virus.\n\nA second dose of the J&J vaccine was recommended for everyone who received their first dose at least two months ago.\n\nA booster dose is not required for a person to be considered fully immunized. People who received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or one dose of J&J, are fully immunized.\n\nAll booster doses will be free, just as are all COVID-19 vaccines, said Dr. Sujan Reddy, medical director of CDC’s Prevention Epicenter Program at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n\nFDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots for people 65 and older or at high risk for COVID-19 because of health problems, jobs or living conditions on Sept. 22.\n\nThe CDC committee votes came after more than six hours of presentations and discussions.\n\nModerna presented information showing the efficacy of the vaccine after a two-dose series fell over time and most sharply after the rise of the delta coronavirus variant. This resulted in more breakthrough cases of COVID-19 in fully vaccinated people.\n\nTesting of a booster dose of Modera at least six months after their second shot showed a 16- to 22-fold increase in protection against the delta variant, Moderna told the committee.\n\nThe Moderna booster dose is 50 micrograms, one-half the initial 100 micrograms of the initial two doses. Moderna used the smaller dose because it restored the level of immunity as well as a larger dose.\n\n“Our goal is to always use the dose that is most optimally effective for boosting,” said Dr. Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s senior vice president for infectious diseases.\n\nJohnson & Johnson presented data showing that a single dose of its vaccine provided 74% protection against severe disease globally and 70% protection against all symptomatic disease. Trends over time showed a decline in effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19, most likely linked to coronavirus variants, said Dr. Penny Heaton, the company's global therapeutic area head for vaccines.\n\nBut the CDC has reported the J&J vaccine was only 68% effective against hospitalization in most adults and was not equivalent to the protection provided by either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.\n\nJohnson & Johnson presented studies showing that in the United States, protection against all systemic disease rose to 94% after a booster dose of its vaccine at two months. There were no severe cases of COVID-19 among those who received the booster, making the vaccine 100% effective, the company said.\n\nA smaller pool of data showed the booster dose of the J&J vaccine at six months was even more potent that at two months. It resulted in a 12-fold increase in antibodies, the company said.\n\nSide effects among those who received the boosters were very rare and lower than among those who received the first dose.\n\nMore than 189 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, about 57% of the total population. Hospitalization rates among unvaccinated Americans are between nine and 15 times higher than among vaccinated people, according to the CDC.\n\nAlmost 6% of fully vaccinated Americans have already received a COVID-19 booster shot, according to CDC data.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/covid-booster-flu-shot-timing-explained-wellness/index.html", "title": "Getting your Covid booster and flu shot at the same time: everything ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFall and winter are around the corner, which means not only is it time to get your flu shot, but US health officials are urging everyone who is eligible to get their updated Covid-19 booster, too.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the updated Covid-19 vaccine boosters this month, after the US Food and Drug Administration’s authorization. The updated Pfizer/BioNTech booster is authorized for people 12 and older, and Moderna’s is authorized for 18 and older.\n\nAt the same time, health officials stress the recommendation to get your seasonal flu vaccine. Some disease forecasters worry that the upcoming flu season could be a tough one for North America, as nations in the Southern Hemisphere that already had their flu seasons – like Australia and New Zealand – saw higher-than-average peaks in cases. So, the United States could see flu make a comeback while Covid-19 is still circulating at higher levels.\n\nBarring any new and concerning coronavirus variants, some officials predict that the updated Covid-19 shots could be the start of recommended boosters for Americans each year, similar to how updated annual flu vaccines are given.\n\n“For a majority of Americans, one shot a year will provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness, and that’s what we’ve got to be focused on,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN last week. “Maybe for some high-risk people – the elderly, the immunocompromised – they may need protection more than once a year, but for a majority of Americans, that’s where it is, and I think that’s a really good place to be.”\n\nWhere and when to get Covid-19 booster and flu shot\n\nThe updated Covid-19 vaccine booster and seasonal flu vaccines are available at most pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health care clinics.\n\nNot only are US health officials encouraging people to get both shots this year, some local public health departments are planning to schedule joint vaccine clinics, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“Jurisdictions are going to be standing up joint flu and Covid vaccine clinics and other opportunities for people to get both their flu vaccine and their Covid updated booster together,” Freeman said, adding that there is “no problem at all” with getting both shots at or around the same time.\n\nThe hope is for joint clinics to make it more convenient and accessible for people to get their vaccinations – but not everyone might be interested or even eligible to get both vaccines at the same time. Plus, some say it’s still early to get a flu shot.\n\nA single dose of the updated Covid-19 booster is recommended at least two months after the initial vaccine series or your most recent booster.\n\n“Now, suppose you’ve recovered from Covid – and many people of course have had Covid this summer – wait three months, at least,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nHe added that it’s important to get your booster as soon as you are eligible.\n\n“It’s clear that whether you’re vaccinated or you’ve had Covid, if you get this booster, you will get much higher levels of antibody and they are thought to help us get more prolonged protection,” he said. “The other thing that happens is that the immune system responds more broadly, and it looks as though we will get more broad coverage against other variants.”\n\nAs for the flu shot, the recommended timing of vaccination for this flu season is similar to last season, according to the CDC’s website.\n\n“For most people who need only one dose for the season, September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated,” according to the CDC, adding that while “ideally” it’s recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October, vaccination after October can still provide protection during the peak of flu season.\n\n“The ideal time is during the month of October and maybe the first couple of weeks of November – and the reason I say that is, particularly for older people and people who are frail, that will help their protection extend well through February into March, and that’s when flu often peaks in the United States in February,” Schaffner said. “Everyone ages 6 months and older should get influenza vaccine.”\n\nAs for children younger than 12, who are not eligible for the updated Covid-19 booster, Schaffner said parents should focus on getting their youngsters vaccinated with the primary series or booster they can get now.\n\n“I would say, maintain the current schedule,” he said. “Because it’s quite clear the original still does a good job in protecting us against hospitalizations and more severe disease.”\n\nSchaffner added that some people have asked him whether the Covid-19 vaccine protects against flu or vice versa. They do not.\n\n“You do have to get both vaccines,” he said. “The Covid vaccine will not protect against flu. The flu vaccine will not protect against Covid.”\n\nBracing for possible Covid-19 surge\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced its plan to manage Covid-19 this fall as there is the potential for an increase in infections, in part due to waning immunity from vaccines and infection.\n\n“Additionally, as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, contagious viruses like COVID-19 can spread more easily,” the announcement says. “And, as we saw last fall with the emergence of Omicron, we must continue to stay prepared for the possibility of a potential new variant of concern.”\n\nThe White House continues to call on Congress to pass additional funding for Covid-19 response, having asked for an updated $22.4 billion last week. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said that passing that funding would be “a very hard lift.”\n\nThe administration’s plan to manage Covid-19 this fall includes focusing on encouraging updated booster vaccinations and making them easy to access, as well as ensuring that people have easy access to at-home rapid tests and treatments. That includes the purchase of 100 million additional at-home rapid tests from domestic manufacturers, the White House said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services “will launch a paid media campaign aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on those over age 50, as well as Black, Hispanic, rural, Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native audiences through TV, radio, digital and print outlets.”\n\nThe administration is also boosting “easy access to Covid-19 testing and treatments” but warned, “While the lack of additional COVID-19 funding from Congress puts constraints on what we are able to do, the Administration will do everything in its power to ensure that tests and treatments remain widely available and easy to access, and will encourage Americans to use them.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/health/moderna-pfizer-child-vaccine-differences-wellness/index.html", "title": "How are the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for young children ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFinally, Covid-19 vaccines for kids under the age of 5 are going into tiny arms and legs this week. Since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended two options for this age group – one from Pfizer/BioNTech and another from Moderna – parents and caregivers may be wondering which one is right for their child.\n\nThey both use an mRNA platform and both are considered safe and well tolerated. Pediatricians CNN spoke with around the country suggest either is a good option.\n\n“I think they’re both highly efficacious with very great side effect profiles and I would not hesitate to give my kids either,” said Dr. Nina Alfieri, a pediatrician at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “I think both are really good options.”\n\nBoth seem to create protective antibodies in little kids like they do in young adults. There are only subtle differences and one may be a better fit for some kids than the other.\n\nEligible ages\n\nModerna’s Covid-19 vaccine is now authorized for children who are 6 months through 5 years old. Pfizer’s is for children 6 months through 4 years old.\n\nPfizer’s vaccine was previously authorized for children as young as 5. Moderna’s vaccine for people ages 6 through 17 was recently authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the CDC’s vaccine advisers will vote this week on whether to recommend it.\n\nDose size and schedule\n\nA child who gets the Moderna vaccine won’t have to go to the doctor or pharmacy as often, and they’ll get protection a little quicker than the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThe Moderna series is complete with two 25-microgram doses given a month apart. Kids with compromised immune systems would get a third shot. The Moderna shot for young children is a quarter of the size that adults get.\n\nWith Pfizer, it takes three shots for the series to be complete. The company initially tried two doses, but trial data showed that after the second dose, the vaccine didn’t generate enough of an immune response. The three-dose vaccine authorized last week is one-tenth the size of the adult Pfizer dose.\n\nWith Pfizer, the first two shots are given three weeks apart. The third can be given at least eight weeks after the second. In total, it can take almost three months for the child to have the full series.\n\nDown the road, scientists may want kids to get boosters with either company’s vaccine.\n\nFever\n\nKids were slightly more prone to get a fever with the Moderna vaccine; it happened with about a quarter of the trial participants, versus less than 10% with Pfizer. Most of the fevers were mild. Less than 1% of all participants in the trial had a fever that reached 104 degrees.\n\n“That was rare, but I feel like if we’re not honest with parents, when these things come out, that will be concerning,” said Dr. Grant Paulsen, the principal site investigator for the Pfizer and the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials for kids 6 months to 11 years old at Cincinnati Children’s.\n\n“The odds are, most children are just going to do fine and have really minimal problems,” he said. “The majority are not going to have major side effects.”\n\nModerna said that other illnesses that cause fever were in circulation during the trial, and that may have led to some of those fevers, since 10.6% of the kids in the placebo group of the trial that didn’t get the vaccine reported a fever.\n\nDr. Claudia Hoyen, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at UH Rainbow Babies Hospitals in Cleveland said she understands why parents hate to see their child develop a fever, but they should be reassured the fever doesn’t cause any kind of permanent damage or long-term problems and should resolve quickly on its own or in response to over-the-counter medicine like Tylenol or Motrin.\n\n“I think if you keep that in mind and realize that, yes, it’s scary, but it can be manageable,” Hoyen said. “People should work with their pediatrician. I think a lot of the kids with the first dose may or may not even see a fever, but people should work with their pediatrician in case they do and come up with a good plan and that will be the best thing to do. It should resolve quickly.”\n\nGeneral side effects\n\nThe safety data from Moderna and Pfizer, vetted by the FDA and CDC, found potential side effects were mostly mild and short-lived.\n\nSide effects for both most commonly included pain at the injection site, and sometimes there was swelling or redness.\n\nAs far as systemic or body-wide symptoms, the most common was fatigue or sleepiness. Some children had irritability or fussiness, loss of appetite, headache, abdominal pain or discomfort, enlarged lymph nodes, mild diarrhea or vomiting. But everyone got better quickly.\n\n“It’s very similar to the side effects we’ve seen for older kids or for adults. About 24 hours of some kids, you know, they kind of don’t feel as well, they feel tired, they don’t have the same appetite. But thankfully, there have not been any serious side effects of these vaccines,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said on CBS on Monday.\n\nScientists did not see any serious or rare side effects in the trials. They were watching closely for any signs that children developed problems with myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, because there were a handful of cases among older children and adults. But myocarditis was not identified in the trials in young children.\n\nVaccine effectiveness\n\nBoth vaccines were tested when the Omicron variant was the dominant strain of coronavirus. Studies show that no matter what the age or dose level, this particular variant was more successful at evading the protection offered by either company’s vaccine.\n\nThe Omicron variant was tricky for this age group in general. Without access to a vaccine, hospitalization rates among kids 5 and younger were five times as high during the peak of Omicron in the winter, compared to when the Delta variant was the dominant strain last summer, according to a March report from the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nModerna was estimated to be 36.8% effective against symptomatic disease for 2-to-5-year-olds and 50.6% protective against symptomatic disease for those 6-to-23 months old.\n\nFor the Pfizer vaccine, there have only been 10 Covid cases in the vaccinated and placebo group in the trial – that’s too small a number to estimate the vaccine’s efficacy. The topline efficacy data from the preliminary findings is “encouraging” though, according to the company. And the FDA said that the immune response to the vaccine for 6 through 23 months of age, and 2 through 4 years of age was comparable to the immune response of the older participants, but more research will be needed.\n\nBottom line: Get vaccinated\n\nGet the vaccine that’s available, the experts said.\n\n\n\n“I do not think it’s clear that one is any better than the other. They are different,” said Paulsen. “It is very much what the parents prefer. Balancing those differences as well as, honestly, what’s available and what their pediatrician has or what the local hospital has.”\n\nDoctors also suggest looking online or calling to find out what the local site is offering. Not every location will offer both shots. Some vaccine clinics may also not be offering little kid vaccines or may have restrictions on the ages they serve. CVS stores that have MinuteClinics, for instance, will vaccinate this new age group, but only if the child is 18 months or older.\n\nVaccines.gov may be helpful.

The companies’ updated formulations are bivalent vaccines that combine the original vaccines with ones that target Omicron sublineages BA.4 and BA.5, which currently dominates in the United States. Moderna’s shot would be administered as a 50-microgram dose, and Pfizer’s as a 30-microgram dose.\n\nModerna said Tuesday a Phase 2/3 clinical trial on these boosters is now underway. The data it submitted to the FDA comes from experiments in mice as well as data from humans using a different booster which was updated to protect against the BA.1 strain of Omicron.\n\n“We have worked closely with the FDA to ensure that Americans will have access to Moderna’s updated, bivalent booster, which, if authorized, may offer higher, broader, and more durable protection against Covid-19 compared ot the currently authorized booster,” said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna.\n\nNext, the FDA will evaluate the data from Moderna and Pfizer and decide whether to authorize the shots.\n\n“FDA will be using the totality of the available evidence to authorize the fall bivalent boosters,” FDA spokesperson Abigail Capobianco said in a statement emailed to CNN last week. “There are data on many millions of individuals who have received the prototype component as a booster. As for the BA.4/5 component, a combination of nonclinical data obtained in mice, data from prior variant vaccines (including those to beta, delta, and omicron BA.1), along with our extensive knowledge of the safety and efficacy of the mRNA platforms will be used for this decision-making.”\n\nWhen shots could be available\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha has said the updated boosters should be available to the public early- to mid-September, but it is ultimately up to the FDA as to when the shot will get the greenlight.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday that the agency will not convene its independent panel of vaccine experts to seek a recommendation on whether to authorize updated Covid-19 shots.\n\nMarks told the Times the FDA has “extremely good” data that he is “extremely confident” about that shows the shots are safe and will be effective, even though the formulations for the updated boosters have not been tested in humans.\n\nIndependent experts who advise the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations are expected to discuss updated Covid-19 vaccines during meetings next week. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meetings are scheduled for Thursday, September 1, and Friday, September 2.\n\nThe CDC committee typically meets after vaccines have been authorized by the FDA. Shots can be administered only after the CDC recommends them.\n\nProduction of the updated shots is already underway, and states can already order them.

This is the first time updated Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the United States.\n\nBoth are bivalent vaccines that combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages.\n\nPfizer’s updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people age 12 and older. Moderna’s updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older.\n\nThe shots can be administered after they’re recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s vaccine advisory group is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation.\n\nAn OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days – both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven’t been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases.\n\nBooster shift\n\nThe updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive.\n\n“With today’s authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,” the FDA said.\n\nIndividuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule.\n\nPeople too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine.\n\nThe FDA said it will “work quickly” to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it’s working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\n“We want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that’s why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent – the original – booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series – and less than a third of the total population – has also gotten a booster.\n\nThere’s no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a “transitional year,” when people need to make sure they have a “good base upon which we build … which will help protect us against the unknown.”\n\n“If you’ve not yet received a booster dose, or it’s been several months since your last booster dose, now’s the time to consider getting one,” Marks said.\n\nOfficials defend swift authorization\n\nOn Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week.\n\n“The public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,” Marks said.\n\nThe agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it’s a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer.\n\n“We have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. “The FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.”\n\nIn addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1.\n\nHuman studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday. Data from those studies is expected in another month or two.\n\nVaccine milestone\n\n“America is the first country in the world that has authorized a bivalent vaccine where the bivalent vaccine targets the viruses out there,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who is leading the White House Covid-19 response, said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We try to do this every year for the flu. We almost never hit it on the mark. This has taken a lot of work by FDA. It’s been about leaning into the science, leaning into some very good modeling. And then really demanding from the companies that they produce vaccines that are going to be that are going to be matched.”\n\nThe Omicron BA.5 subvariant has dominated transmission in the United States for more than two months. Last week, it caused 89% – nearly 9 out of 10 – new Covid infections in this country, according to the latest estimates from the CDC.\n\nA recent offshoot of the BA.4 variant, BA.4.6, has slowly grown in prevalence to claim second place.

Many people, they argued, would then come off the sidelines and take the millions of jobs that employers were desperate to fill.\n\nYet three months after half the states began ending that federal payment, there’s been no significant influx of job seekers.\n\nIn states that cut off the $300 check, the workforce — the number of people who either have a job or are looking for one — has risen no more than it has in the states that maintained the payment. That federal aid, along with two jobless aid programs that served gig workers and the long-term unemployed, ended nationally Sept. 6. Yet America’s overall workforce actually shrank that month.\n\n“Policymakers were pinning too many hopes on ending unemployment insurance as a labor market boost,” said Fiona Greig, managing director of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which used JPMorgan bank account data to study the issue. “The work disincentive effects were clearly small.”\n\nLabor shortages have persisted longer than many economists expected, deepening a mystery at the heart of the job market. Companies are eager to add workers and have posted a near-record number of available jobs. Unemployment remains elevated. The economy still has 5 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic. Yet job growth slowed in August and September.\n\nAn analysis of state-by-state data by The Associated Press found that workforces in the 25 states that maintained the $300 payment actually grew slightly more from May through September, according to data released Friday, than they did in the 25 states that cut off the payment early, most of them in June. The $300-a-week federal check, on top of regular state jobless aid, meant that many of the unemployed received more in benefits than they earned at their old jobs.\n\nFully vaccinated people make up less than 1% of COVID deaths\n\nScientists knew the COVID-19 vaccines were highly effective at preventing severe disease and death, but they didn’t know exactly how effective until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data showing what experts called a “modern miracle.”\n\nAs of Oct. 12, the agency found only 7,178 deaths occurred among fully vaccinated people in the U.S. In a country that has reported more than 720,000 COVID-related deaths, the fully vaccinated make up less than 1%\n\n“We were all hoping for something to help save our neighbors and our patients and certainly this data is tremendous,” said Dr. Joseph Teel, vice chair of clinical operations for the department of family medicine and community health at Penn Medicine. “It’s a modern miracle in many ways.”\n\nThe vaccine is not a miracle because it worked, health experts say. Scientists have been working on mRNA technology for more than 30 years for other diseases. The COVID-19 vaccine is a miracle because it worked so well despite the uncertainty of a new disease among a diverse population, an unprecedented scale-up and a lack of uptake.\n\n— Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY\n\nFlorida military service members, contractors file suit to halt vaccine mandate\n\nA lawsuit filed in Tampa and representing Southwest Florida asks for a temporary restraining order and injunction regarding service members and a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine order.\n\nThe suit, filed by the Liberty Counsel in Florida's Middle District Court on Oct. 15, states that members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard, and federal employees and federal civilian contractors, have been unlawfully mandated to get the COVID-19 vaccines or face dishonorable discharge from the military or termination from employment.\n\n“The Biden administration has no authority to require the COVID shots for the military or for federal employees or civilian contractors,\" said Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver. \"Nor can the Biden administration pretend that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment do not apply to its unlawful mandates.\n\n— Rachel Heimann Mercader, Naples Daily News\n\nCDC sending team to Guam to study COVID-19 deaths\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will send a team to Guam to investigate why so many COVID-19 patients arrive at the island's hospitals dead.\n\nLast month, the U.S. territory's Department of Public Health and Social Services reported that “dead on arrival” cases made up about two-thirds of recent COVID-19 deaths on Guam.\n\nThe CDC team is coming at the request of Department of Public Health and Social Services Director Art San Agustin, the Pacific Daily News reported.\n\nThe team is expected to take a deep dive into the data, “to look at what actually happened\" and analyze whether the patients had similar comorbidities, Chief Public Health Officer Chima Mbakwem said Thursday.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\n7-week-old baby dies from COVID-19 in Kentucky\n\nA 7-week-old was among the 53 new COVID-related deaths reported in Kentucky on Thursday.\n\nThe daily update shared to the state's website included an additional death in the 0-9 age range, but didn't include any details.

And there’s emerging evidence that it could still play an important role ahead.\n\nA study published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that the J&J vaccine remains durable and effective, even through the surge of cases caused by the Delta variant. It was 76% effective overall in preventing Covid-19 infections and 81% effective in preventing Covid-related hospitalizations. The study also showed that it provided lasting immunity at least six months after the shots.\n\nAnd a CNN analysis of information collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the J&J vaccine had the lowest breakthrough infection rate of all the vaccines since the week ending December 25, the latest five weeks of available data.\n\nIn January, during the Omicron surge, breakthrough infections were highest among those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, followed by those who got Moderna.

With Moderna, there were 757 per 100,000, and with Pfizer, the rate was 862 per 100,000.\n\nUnvaccinated people were particularly vulnerable to getting sick during the Omicron and Delta surges, just as they were with the original version of the coronavirus. They were 3.2 times as likely to get sick as people who had the J&J vaccine. The unvaccinated were 2.8 times as likely to become infected than those who got Moderna and 2.4 times as likely as those who got Pfizer.\n\n“What we saw in the summertime and the fall during the Delta surge is that all three vaccines protected very, very well. But breakthrough rates in August, September of last year with the Janssen vaccine were slightly higher than Pfizer, and Moderna was slightly lower. But those differences were relatively small,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He helped to develop and study the J&J vaccine.\n\n“But what we saw over time is that those differences then narrowed,” he said. “And by the first week of December, what we saw in the data is that the lines cross,” with incidence rates for the J&J/Janssen vaccine becoming lower than the others.\n\n‘Reassuring’ data for J&J recipients\n\nIn March 2021, the J&J vaccine was the third to be authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the initial response was more muted than the milestone authorizations of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nThe vaccines work differently. The mRNA vaccines deliver blueprints, essentially, that train your body trains to fight that particular infection and any similar infection down the road. Adenovirus-vector vaccines, like J&J’s, use a virus that can act like a Trojan horse. But instead of soldiers jumping out, the adenovirus releases genes that encode the coronavirus’ spike protein.\n\nThe J&J vaccine stood out for other reasons, too: It came as a convenient single dose and didn’t require special refrigeration, whereas the mRNA vaccines required two doses, and Pfizer’s needed special cold storage. The flexibility was appealing for people who were afraid of shots or didn’t have the time to get two shots. It was also better for countries without a solid health care infrastructure.\n\nBut its performance tempered some of the enthusiasm around it, especially from the public.\n\nWhereas the mRNA vaccines were hailed for “astonishing” efficacy of more than 90%, the news that J&J was 65% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 among clinical trial volunteers underwhelmed some.\n\nFrom the start, the J&J vaccine supply was more limited. After after the vaccine was authorized, the federal government briefly paused its use due to safety concerns around rare blood clotting events. Even once vaccinations resumed, the pace of J&J vaccinations never recovered.\n\nIn December, the CDC changed its recommendations to say shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are preferred over J&J’s. It also urges people who got the J&J shot to get a booster of one of the mRNA vaccines two months later.\n\nThe protection that the Covid-19 vaccines offered has waned over time, and none of them works as well against the variants that have popped up since the original coronavirus surfaced. But the science is starting to show that people who got the J&J Covid-19 vaccine may have some advantage.\n\nBarouch told CNN that he “wasn’t surprised at all” to see that the durability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears to be last longer than that of the mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – based on the incidence of breakthrough infections.\n\nThe mRNA vaccine technology has been shown to quickly elicit a potent and robust immune response after vaccination, but that can wane over time. Johnson & Johnson’s virus-vector platform may not spark as powerful of an immune response in the short term, but it is known to have strong durability.\n\n“Over time, the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines goes down, the efficacy of the J&J vaccines remains stable, and so it is exactly as you would predict: that they will converge and they will then cross,” Barouch said.\n\nThe J&J vaccine also might have “a particular edge,” he said.\n\n“The immune system is actually made of two arms: the antibodies side and the T cells. And the type of T cells that are critical for prevention of serious illness are called CD8 T cells,” Barouch said. “The J&J vaccine raises better CD8 T cells than the Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines, so the J&J vaccine might have a particular edge for variants like Omicron that largely escaped from antibody responses.”\n\nOverall, Barouch called this data “very reassuring” for recipients of the J&J vaccine.\n\n“They should be reassured that they received a vaccine that gives very good protection for a long period of time,” Barouch said. “And I think the second message is that I think people should learn about these new data in terms of considering booster shots, as well.”\n\nProspects as a booster?\n\nDavid Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center, said “the J&J vaccine has kind of gotten a bad rap because of the efficacy, but the stability of the response is intriguing.”\n\nThe antibody level went down with every vaccine during the Omicron surge, and that could mean people need an additional booster. More research is needed to find out.\n\nA yet-unpublished study by the National Institutes of Health looking at a mix-and-match vaccine strategy saw good results when J&J was included, Montefiori said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“In people who got the Pfizer vaccine initially and then a boosted with the J&J vaccine, those people made pretty high levels of neutralizing antibodies to Omicron: 10 times higher than people who got two shots with just the J&J vaccine,” he said. “So the J&J vaccine might be a good booster for people who got an mRNA vaccine initially.”\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be used for primary doses or as a booster, but the CDC says the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended in most situations because of the risk of serious adverse events with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe J&J vaccine has been linked to rare cases of blood clots with low platelets, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. “It occurs at a rate of about 3.83 cases per million Janssen doses and has resulted in deaths,” the CDC says.\n\nDr. Angela Branche, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Rochester, said the side effect profile of the J&J vaccine “remains something that’s of concern for some groups where that risk is high.” Women ages 30 to 49 years are at increased risk of this rare adverse event, the CDC says.\n\nBut if that research pans out, the J&J vaccine may be useful as a booster for only certain populations.\n\n“For some groups where that risk of developing serious blood clots is not very high, like older adults, this may be a good strategy,” Branche said.\n\nMontefiori said the vaccine deserves more study.\n\n“I think there might still be a place for the J&J vaccine in the long-term picture of this pandemic,” Montefiori said.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Deidre Mcphillips", "Jen Christensen", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/10/13/covid-19-vaccine-study-pfizer-moderna-best-booster/8443440002/", "title": "COVID-19 vaccine study shows Pfizer, Moderna as best booster for ...", "text": "The National Institutes of Health study found that the J&J shot followed by one of the mRNA vaccines as a booster produced a stronger immune response than two doses of J&J.\n\nIn response to the study, Johnson & Johnson noted that a booster of its vaccine increased the immune response regardless of a person's previous primary vaccination.\n\nThe FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets Thursday to discuss Moderna boosters and Friday to discuss J&J boosters.\n\nThe best booster for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine may be either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, according to a National Institutes of Health study posted Wednesday.\n\n\"The Mix and Match was a big study people were waiting for, it gave a lot of new data, and there hadn't been any about Johnson & Johnson with an mRNA booster before,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, vice president for research at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, and a national expert on the use of data in medical research.\n\nThe study, which included nearly 500 people, found that the J&J shot followed by one of the mRNA vaccines as a booster produced a stronger immune response than two doses of J&J.\n\nFor people who got either the Pfizer or Moderna two-dose series, a booster dose of either mRNA vaccine was effective.\n\nThe new study came just a day before a crucial Food and Drug Administration advisory committee begins to meet to discuss possible booster doses of the Moderna and J&J vaccines.

It compared all possible combinations of the three vaccines followed by a booster.\n\n\"If you look at the Mix and Match data, you’d say, ‘Wow, I really want to get an mRNA booster.' It basically converts Johnson & Johnson to be as good as an mRNA two-shot series,’” said Topol.\n\nThe study volunteers were divided into three groups. One got the two-dose series of the Pfizer vaccine, one the two-dose series of Moderna and one the \"one and done\" J&J vaccine.\n\nEach group was then divided into three smaller groups. One got Pfizer as their booster, one Moderna and one J&J.\n\nParticipants' antibody levels against COVID-19 were measured two weeks and then four weeks after they received their booster shot.\n\nPeople who got either the Pfizer or Moderna series and Pfizer or Moderna as a booster all got similar protection.\n\nThe lowest antibody levels were for people who got a J&J shot followed by a J&J booster.\n\n'Naked in the world of COVID':Some J&J vaccine recipients feel unprotected against delta and want mRNA shots\n\nIn response to the study, Johnson & Johnson noted that a booster of its vaccine increased the immune response regardless of a person's previous primary vaccination.\n\n\"Johnson & Johnson will continue to share available boosting data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulators, and looks forward to discussing the latest available data at this week’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the company said in a release.\n\nThe NIH study didn't include real-world data about how effective the vaccines plus boosters were at preventing mild or severe COVID-19. However, the antibody response is believed to be a good indicator of vaccine effectiveness.\n\nThere is somewhat equivalent real-world data out of Spain and the United Kingdom.

Whether the small group of recipients is enough for agency to approve a six-month booster isn’t clear.\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\n“The hope was that we would get a resolution of these issue and that J&J would get their emergency use authorization for a booster. Now things have gotten a little more complicated,” said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe safety data for people receiving a J&J booster was good, and according to FDA, the vaccine “still affords protection against severe COVID-19 disease and death,” although less so than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nIn its briefing documents, J&J said boosters might be given anywhere between two and six months after the initial shot, depending on who got the shot and how strong their immune response was.\n\nAbout 15 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with the J&J vaccine, compared with 103 million who’ve gotten Pfizer and 69 million who’ve gotten Moderna. So far, 8.8 million Americans have received a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/health/vaccine-covid-booster-wen-wellness/index.html", "title": "Will everyone need an annual Covid-19 booster? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore people can now get second Covid-19 booster shots after federal health officials announced they are allowing a broader group to get fourth doses of the two messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nAdults 50 and older, who received three previous mRNA doses, can get a second booster dose if it’s been at least four months since their first one. Everyone who received two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can also receive an additional mRNA dose four months after their last booster.\n\nMany people are wondering: Does it mean everyone is going to need an annual Covid-19 booster? Do we need booster shots even more frequently? Is it going to be combined with the flu shot? Are new vaccines going to be developed that target new variants? And should they wait to get the booster if they are eligible, or get it now?\n\nTo help answer these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: Will everyone need a Covid-19 shot every year?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: We don’t know yet. There are a lot of variables here, and only time – and ongoing research – will tell.\n\nFirst, we don’t know how long the immune protection from the vaccine and first booster will last. There is a lot of evidence that the first booster is very important. During a time when Omicron was the dominant variant, the effectiveness of three doses against severe disease remained high, at 94%, according to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If this protection starts waning substantially, that would be a sign that another booster is needed.\n\nSecond, there may be new variants that develop over time. The influenza vaccine is given annually after it’s reconfigured every year for new mutations. The current vaccines work well against the Omicron subvariants, but if there are future variants that evade vaccine-induced immunity, that’s another reason for additional vaccinations.\n\nArmy veteran Robert Hall waits the recommended 15 minutes to see if he will have any adverse reactions after receiving his second Covid-19 booster shot at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital on April 1 in Hines, Illinois. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThird, we need to monitor for how prevalent Covid-19 is. Right now, it is still rampant throughout the world, but if it ends up fading, regular booster doses may not be needed. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said to CNN, “Will it ultimately get to such a low level that we might not even need a boost every year?” That’s possible, but we don’t know yet.\n\nFourth, we need to see whether there is a clear seasonality to future Covid-19 outbreaks. Other coronaviruses that cause the common cold are more prevalent in the winter, as are other respiratory viruses like RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and influenza. It’s likely that SARS-CoV-2 is, too, and there have been surges during winter months. This part, though, still needs to be seen in this coming fall and winter seasons.\n\nFinally, there are logistical considerations to think about. Adding an annual vaccine is a big undertaking. The uptake of the influenza vaccine is already low; just only about half of Americans get it every year. With the misinformation and polarization around Covid-19, encouraging this level of frequency will be a big undertaking.\n\nCNN: Right now, a second booster is already allowed four months after the first, which means that the current frequency is more than once a year. Could boosters be needed even more than once a year?\n\nWen: It’s possible. I want to emphasize that there is a lot we don’t know, simply because we don’t have the ability to foretell the future.\n\nThere are a couple of different scenarios that could occur. One is that certain groups of people may need more frequent vaccines. Recall that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have been recommended to get their additional booster for months. It’s possible that, going forward, certain more vulnerable populations will be recommended to get vaccines at a higher frequency than the general population.\n\nIn addition, there will also need to be contingencies if a new variant arises that evades prior immunity. There should be the option to develop, manufacture and quickly distribute variant-specific vaccines. If this happens, the frequency could end up being more than once a year for a particular time period.\n\nGoing forward, we have to consider the availability of other therapies and mitigation measures, too. For example, Evusheld is an antibody infusion that, when given to immunocompromised individuals, is very effective at reducing their likelihood of progression to severe illness. Antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies are effective treatments when given early in the course of illness. And there are other preventive measures, including masking and testing before get-togethers, that can reduce risk, too.\n\nCNN: If the Covid-19 vaccine is going to be given annually, would it make sense to combine it with the flu vaccine?\n\nWen: In theory, yes, but we just don’t know if the Covid-19 vaccine needs to be an annual shot.\n\nThere are other vaccines that last longer. The Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria vaccine), for example, requires a booster every 10 years. The polio vaccine is a four-dose vaccine – you get four doses, and you’re done. Hepatitis B is a three-dose vaccine.\n\nIt’s possible that Covid-19 could be three or four doses, and we’re done, or it may need to be updated more frequently like influenza. Again, we just don’t know yet. If it does end up being something that’s annual, and the seasonal pattern appears similar to influenza, then having a combined shot – or at least, getting it at the same time as the flu shot – would be sensible.\n\nCNN: Why aren’t there variant-specific vaccines that target Omicron?\n\nWen: Scientists are working on these vaccines now. They are testing Omicron-specific vaccines and boosters to see if they could be even more effective than the original vaccines, which were targeting the previously dominant variants.\n\nOne consideration is that additional variants may arise, and scientists have to think about whether the Omicron-specific vaccines or the original vaccine – or some combination – will be most likely to be effective against potential variants in the future. This was among the many issues that advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration discussed in their meeting this week.\n\nCNN: If people are eligible for boosters now, should they get them, or should they wait?\n\nWen: It depends on the individual’s medical circumstance and how much they are willing to give up to avoid Covid-19, as I mentioned in our CNN Q&A last week. Someone who is over age 65 and/or immunocompromised should probably get the additional booster now.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOn the other hand, someone who is between ages 50 and 65, with no medical problems and recently had an Omicron infection, could probably wait. Some people might defer an additional booster as long as they are well-protected against severe illness. Others want to avoid any infection, even mild and asymptomatic infections. These are all personal decisions to be made in consultation with your medical provider.\n\nCNN: What’s your booster advice for people under 50? Should people get their first booster? And should they go for their second?\n\nWen: Everyone should get their first booster if eligible. The question of the second booster is more complex. If the person is under 50 and moderately or severely immunocompromised, they should also get their second booster. Another group that should get their second booster, even if they are under 50, are those who received two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and it’s been at least four months since their last dose. All other groups under 50 are not eligible to receive their second booster at this time and should not go for their second.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}]}

The contest to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Kate Brown in the deep-blue state turned unexpectedly difficult for Kotek after the independent candidacy of former state Sen. Betsy Johnson made for competitive three-way race.\n\n“I want to express my deepest gratitude to all those who supported me and put their trust in our campaign. I also want to assure Oregonians that every vote will be counted and that their voices were heard in this election. Unfortunately, given what we know about the ballots outstanding, the math for a comeback simply does not add up,” Drazan said in a statement.\n\nNo one expected Oregon – a state that President Joe Biden won by 16 percentage points in 2020 – to be difficult terrain for Democrats, especially since Republicans have not won the governor’s office since 1982. But Johnson, a former Democrat, proved to be an unusually strong contender who kept pace in fundraising with her two rivals in this three-way all-women matchup with donations from business leaders, including Nike founder Phil Knight.\n\nBrown’s unpopularity in the state combined with Johnson’s presence in the race vaulted Drazan, a former state House minority leader, into a fierce contest with Kotek, the former Democratic House speaker. Republicans comprise only about a quarter of the electorate, while Democrats make up about 34% and nonaffiliated Oregonians account for nearly 35%, according to the most recent figures from the Oregon secretary of state.\n\nBut Oregonians have been unnerved by the problems with homelessness and the rise in violent crime in Portland. The city’s downtown also still has not recovered from the impact of pandemic-era business closures and the more than 100 days of protests against police brutality – some of them violent – that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nDrazan sought to capitalize on the disquiet about those issues, arguing that the state’s troubles stem from single-party control over about a decade that has led to a lack of accountability.\n\nBut Kotek argued that Drazan was too extreme for Oregon – highlighting her opposition to abortion rights, for example. Rather than demonstrating an ability to work with both sides, Kotek also said that Drazan demonstrated obstructionist tendencies when she led a legislative walkout in 2020 to protest a climate bill. Kotek argued that Drazan’s move effectively killed legislation that would have advanced the state’s efforts to improve homelessness, among other issues. (Drazan’s campaign said that allegation was an excuse.)\n\nBiden campaigned for Kotek during a swing through the western states, urging voters to “stay ahead of the curve” as a progressive state by electing the former House speaker.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/midterm-election-results-historic-moments/8308371001/", "title": "How Wes Moore, Maura Healey, Maxwell Frost made history this ...", "text": "This year's midterm elections are making history.\n\nIn Maryland, Wes Moore was elected the state's first Black governor; nationally he is the third elected Black governor.\n\nIn an election cycle with record numbers of LGBTQ candidates, the country's first lesbian governor was elected in Massachusetts, and New Hampshire voters elected the first transgender man to a state legislature.\n\nThe results have also seen new representation of women and younger generations, from the first female governor of Arkansas to the first Gen Z elected member of Congress.\n\nHere are some of the historic moments in the 2022 midterms.\n\nElection 2022 live updates:Republican JD Vance wins Ohio Senate seat; Abbott, Shapiro prevail\n\nNation's first lesbian governor is elected\n\nMaryland elects first Black governor\n\nWes Moore won the gubernatorial race in Maryland, making the Democrat the state's first Black governor and the third Black elected governor in U.S. history.\n\nFirst Gen Z member of Congress\n\nArkansas has its first female governor\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, Republican and the White House press secretary under President Donald Trump, becomes the first woman to win the governorship in Arkansas.\n\nFirst trans man in state legislature\n\nJames Roesener was elected to New Hampshire's Legislature, the first transgender man to win in any state legislature election.\n\nVermont is last state to send a woman to Congress\n\nWith Democrat Becca Balint winning the state's sole House seat, Vermont became the last state to elect a woman to Congress.

Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor.

Summer Lee will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida has also elected the youngest-ever House member, 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, now on track to become the first Gen Z candidate to hold federal office.\n\nVirginia’s split decision offers early signals\n\nThree Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.\n\n“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Dan Merica Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/opinions/outcome-us-2022-midterm-election-roundup/index.html", "title": "Opinion: A really bad night for some high-profile Trump-backed ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCNN Opinion contributors share their thoughts on the outcome of the 2022 midterm elections.

Ron DeSantis sent a clear message to every Republican voter Tuesday night: My way is the path to a national majority, and former President Donald Trump’s way is the path to future disappointments and continued suffering.\n\nFour years ago, DeSantis won his first gubernatorial race by less than a percentage point. His nearly 20-point win against Democratic candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday sent the message that DeSantis, not Trump, can win over the independent voters who decide elections.\n\nDeSantis’ decisive victory offers a future where the Republican Party might actually win the popular vote in a presidential contest – something that hasn’t been done since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the candidates Trump endorsed in 2022 struggled, and it was clear from CNN exit polls that the former President – with his 37% favorability rating – would be a serious underdog in the 2024 general election should he win the Republican presidential nomination for a third time.\n\nMy friend Patrick Ruffini of Echelon Insights tweeted a key observation: DeSantis commanded huge support among Latinos in 2022 compared to Trump in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won the heavily Latino Miami-Dade County by seven points. DeSantis flipped the county on Tuesday and ran away with an 11-point win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Osceola County by nearly 14 points. This time, DeSantis secured the county by nearly seven points, marking a whopping 21-point swing.\n\nDeSantis combined his strength among Latinos with his support among working class Whites, suburban white-collar voters and rural Floridians. That’s a coalition that could win nationally, unlike Trump’s limited appeal among several traditional Republican voting segments.\n\nLast year, it was Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia who scored an earthquake in a Biden state by keeping Trump at arm’s length and focusing on the issues. Tonight, it was DeSantis who ran as his own man (Trump rallied for Marco Rubio but not DeSantis at the end of the campaign) and showed what you can do when you combine the political instincts required to be a successful Republican these days with actual governing competence.\n\nDeSantis made a convincing case that he, rather than Trump, gives Republicans the best chance to defeat Biden (or some other Democrat) in 2024. With Trump plotting a reelection campaign announcement soon, DeSantis has a lot to think about and a solid springboard from which to launch a challenge to the former President.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W.

If election night confirmed anything for me it is this: We can all – voters, doomscrollers, pundits and election deniers included – stop believing every election revolves around former President Donald Trump. Instead, when asked in exit polls across the country, younger people, women and other voters in key demographics said their top concerns were inflation, abortion rights, crime and other quality of life issues.\n\nWhat a relief. It finally feels like a majority of voters want to re-center American politics away from the toxic, conspiracy theory-driven rhetoric we’ve experienced over the past several years.\n\nYes, Republicans are still projected to take control of the House of Representatives, with a narrow (and narrowing) majority – but will that make much difference? Despite the advantage Democrats had in the chamber the past two years, President Joe Biden has still had to battle and compromise to get parts of his agenda passed. How the balance of power will settle in the Senate is unclear, with a few races in key states still undecided as of this afternoon. It will likely hinge, again, on Georgia, and a forthcoming runoff election between the incumbent, Democrat Raphael Warnock, and his GOP challenger, former football star Herschel Walker.\n\nNo matter what party you claim, there were positive signs coming out of the midterms. My hometown, Philadelphia, and its surrounding suburbs, came up big in another election – rejecting the Trump-backed New Jersey transplant, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and helping to send Democratic candidate John Fetterman to the US Senate. Pennsylvania voters also rejected an election denier, Doug Mastriano, in the race for state governor, and made history by electing Democrat Summer Lee as the state’s first Black woman to serve in Congress.\n\nMaryland voters, meanwhile, elected Democrat Wes Moore as their state’s first Black governor. And in New England, Maura Healey became Massachusetts’ first female governor. She’s also the first out lesbian to win a state governorship anywhere in the US.\n\nDemocracy, freedom and equality also won out on ballot issues.\n\nIn unfinished business, voters tackled slavery, permanently abolishing “involuntary servitude” in four states – Vermont, Oregon, Alabama and Tennessee. (Louisiana held on to the slavery clause under its constitution, however.)\n\nDespite efforts to limit voting rights across the nation, voters in Alabama approved a measure requiring that any change to state election law goes into effect at least six months before a general election. And, in Kentucky, voters narrowly beat back an amendment that would have removed constitutional protections for abortion rights – one of several instances in which voters refused to accept restrictive reproductive rights measures.\n\nStill, the highlight of my midterms night was watching 25-year-old Maxwell Frost win a US congressional race in Florida – holding a Democratic seat in a state whose 2022 results skewed red, no less. More and more, we are seeing young people energized, voting and stepping up with fresh ideas to lead this democracy.

Despite his efforts, many of his favorites not only lost but denied the GOP the usual out-party wave of wins that come in midterm elections. This leaves a diminished Trump with the challenge of deciding what to do next.\n\nIn the short term, the man who so often returns to his well-worn playbook resumed his years-long effort to ruin Americans’ confidence in any election his team loses. “Protest, protest, protest,” he told his followers, even before all the polls closed. In a sign of his declining power, no mass protests ensued.\n\nNevertheless, false claims of election fraud will likely be a major theme if he follows through on his loudly voiced hints that he plans to run for the White House again in 2024.\n\nTo run or not to run is now the main question. It’s not an easy choice. Trump could end up like other one-term presidents he has mocked, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, who retreated from politics and devoted themselves to new interests. However, he has other options. He could revive his television career – Fox News? – or return to his businesses. Or, he could develop a new role as leader of an organization that can exploit his prodigious fundraising ability, and give him a platform for grabbing attention, while leaving him plenty of time for golf.\n\nRunning could forestall the various legal problems he faces, but he has lawyers who might accomplish the same goal. Fox News is unlikely to pay enough, and his businesses are now being watched by a court-appointed overseer. This leaves him with a combination of easy work – fundraising and pontificating – combined with his favorite pastimes: fame, money and fun. What’s not to like?\n\nMichael D’Antonio is the author of the book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book “High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.”\n\nDavid Gergen: A sigh of relief for Americans\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nFor many Americans deeply worried about the future of our democracy, Tuesday’s elections brought a glimmer of hope. Instead of chaos, we had an orderly process of voting. So far, the streets have been free of violence, the courts are not clogged with petitions to overthrow the results and many election deniers have been cast aside. Overall, this was an election that rejected the extremists and rallied the friends of democracy. Whatever your political leanings, that is very good news.\n\nIt was especially encouraging to see voters of younger generations turn out in droves. John Della Volpe, the pollster for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, told me that this was the third straight national election – 2018, 2020 and now 2022 – in which the youth vote has surged. And their votes mattered: Drawing upon exit polls, Volpe estimates that voters over 40 were likely to vote for Republican candidates while voters under 40 went for Democrats – and those under 40 were the determining factor.\n\nIt was also inspiring that a number of newcomers to the political arena did so well in pledging to work with others across the aisle. There is no better example than Wes Moore, who was elected the first Black governor of Maryland. Moore had never run for office before, but he had a compelling background – a combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne, a powerful leader in the nonprofit world and far more – and he spoke with a humility that appealed.\n\nThis was also an election, of course, that will go down in history as a huge surprise. Give credit where it is due – President Joe Biden pulled it off even though his approval ratings were fairly abysmal. Now the question is whether he can translate his success (and that of other Democrats) into greater progress in governing. Knowing how recalcitrant his opponents can be, he was smart to reach out to Republican leaders within hours.\n\nBottom line: Tough days still lie ahead, but for one of the first times in recent memory, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief that there are still people in the public arena hungry to bring us together again.\n\nDavid Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN.

Gov. Hochul now has to deliver\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy of Jill Filipovic\n\nDemocrat Kathy Hochul won the New York State gubernatorial race, and thank goodness. Her opponent, Lee Zeldin, is not your typical moderate Republican who usually stands a chance in a blue state. Instead, he’s an abortion opponent who wanted voters to simply trust he wouldn’t mess with New York’s abortion laws.\n\nZeldin was endorsed by the National Rifle Association when he was in Congress. He is a Trump acolyte who voted against certifying the 2020 election in Congress, after texting with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and reportedly planning to contest the outcome of the 2020 election before the results were even in.\n\nNew Yorkers sent a definitive message: Our values matter, even in moments of profound uncertainty.\n\nPlus, Hochul made history as the first woman elected to the governor’s office in New York.\n\nThis race was, in its final days, predicted to be closer than it actually was. Part of that was simply the usual electoral math: The minority party typically has an advantage in the midterms, and Republicans are a minority in Washington, DC, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress. And polling in New York state didn’t look as good for Hochul as it should have in a solidly blue state: Voters who talked to pollsters emphasized crime fears and the economy; abortion rights were galvanizing, but didn’t seem as definitive in an election for a governor vastly unlikely to have an abortion criminalization bill delivered to her desk.\n\nThe polls were imperfect. It turns out that New Yorkers are, in fact, New Yorkers: Not cowed by overblown claims of crime (while I think crime is indeed a problem Democrats should address, New York City remains one of the safest places in the country); determined to defend the racial, ethnic and sexual diversity that makes our state great; and committed to standing up against the tyranny of an anti-democratic party that would force women into pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nHowever, Democrats shouldn’t take this win for granted. The issues voters raised – inflation, crime – are real concerns. And the reasons many voters turned out – abortion rights, democratic norms – remain under threat.\n\nHochul’s job now is to address voter concerns, while standing up for New York values: Openness, decency, freedom for all. Because that’s what New Yorkers did today: The majority of us didn’t cast our ballots from a place of fear and reaction, but from the last dregs of hope and optimism. We voted for what we want. And we now want our governor to deliver.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nDouglas Heye: In North Carolina, the issue of crime loomed large\n\nDouglas Heye Jeremy Freeman\n\nNorth Carolina’s Senate race received less attention than contests in some other states – possibly a result of the campaign having lesser-known candidates than states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nIn the waning weeks of the race, multiple polls had the candidates – Democratic former state Supreme Court chief justice Cheri Beasley and Republican US House Rep. Ted Budd – separated by a percentage point or less.\n\nPerhaps more than in any other Senate campaign, the issue of crime loomed large in North Carolina, with Budd claiming in his speeches that it had become much more dangerous to walk the streets in the state. That talking point, along with his focus on inflation, appeared to help propel him to victory in Tuesday’s vote.\n\nBeasley, by contrast, focused much of her attention on abortion, making it a central plank of her campaign that she would stand up not just for women’s reproductive rights, but workplace protections and equal pay.\n\nThe two candidates were vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Despite being seen as a red state – albeit that is less solidly Republican than neighboring southern states – North Carolina has elected Democrats as five of the last six governors and two of the last six senators.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama won the state in 2008 but lost it in 2012 by one of the closest margins in the nation. And while Donald Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020, he never received 50% of the vote.\n\nDouglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator.

Nelson\n\nMany of us suspected that Democratic Florida Congresswoman and former House impeachment manager Val Demings would have an uphill battle unseating incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, and weren’t entirely surprised when she lost the race. With 98% of the vote counted, Rubio won easily, garnering 57.8% of the vote to Demings’ 41.1%.\n\nAs it turns out, Tuesday was a tough night all around for Black women running statewide. Beyond Demings’ loss, Judge Cheri Beasley narrowly lost her Senate bid in North Carolina.\n\nAnd in the big heartbreak of the night, Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race to Gov. Brian Kemp – a repeat of her defeat to him four years ago, when the two tangled for what at the time was an open seat.\n\nAbrams shook up the 2018 race by expanding the electoral map, enlisting more women and people of color who turned out in record numbers – but she fell short of punching her ticket to Georgia’s governor’s mansion. And on Tuesday she lost to Kemp by a much wider margin than in 2018.\n\nHad Abrams succeeded, she would have been the first Black woman to become the governor of a US state. After her second straight electoral loss, America is still waiting for that breakthrough.\n\nMeanwhile, an ever bigger winner of the night was Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, who handily defeated Democrat Charlie Crist.\n\nDeSantis’ big night solidifies what some feel is a compelling claim to front-runner status for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, on what turned out to be a strong election night for Republicans in the state.\n\nIt’s hard for a Democrat to win statewide in the deep South. And as Demings, Beasley and Abrams have shown, it’s particularly tough for a Black woman to win statewide in the region: In fact, it’s never been done.\n\nAll three women were well-qualified and well-funded stars in their party. But, when we look at the final vote tallies, it tells a familiar story. Take Demings, for example, a former law enforcement officer – she was Orlando’s police chief – and yet, she did not get the big law enforcement endorsements. Rubio did, although he never wore the blue.\n\nThat was a big red flag for me, and it showed how much gender and race still play in the minds of male voters and power brokers of my generation and older. For Black women, a double burden of both race and gender at play. It is the nagging story of our lives.\n\nAs for Abrams, I think Kemp was helped by backing away from Trump and modulating his campaign message to appeal to suburban women and independents.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, just didn’t have the same support and enthusiasm this time around for her candidacy. And that is unfortunate, but for her to lose by such a big margin says much more.\n\nAt the end of the day however, these three women have nothing to regret. They ran great campaigns, and they created great future platforms for themselves. And they each put one more crack in the glass ceiling facing candidates for the US Senate and governors’ mansions.\n\nSophia A.

Still, as a longtime Pennsylvania election-watcher, I see three clear takeaways:\n\n1) Pennsylvanians don’t take to extreme anti-establishment candidates. The GOP candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano, broke the mold of just about any statewide candidate in the last few decades.\n\nThe state that delivered wins to center-right and center-left candidates like my father Gov, Dick Thornburgh, Sen. Bob Casey and Gov, Tom Ridge gave establishment Democrat Josh Shapiro a wipeout double-digit victory.\n\n2) “You’re not from here and I am” and “Stick it to the man” proved to be sufficiently powerful messages for alt-Democrat John Fetterman to win his Senate race, albeit by a much smaller margin.\n\nAmplified by more than $300 million in campaign spending (making PA’s the most expensive Senate race in the country), those two simple themes spoke to the quirky, stubborn authenticity that is a longstanding strand of Pennsylvania’s political DNA.\n\n3) In the home of Independence Hall, independent voters made a significant difference. Pretty much every poll since the beginning of both marquee races showed the two party candidates with locked in lopsided mirror-image margins among members of their own party.\n\nOver 90% of Democrats said they’d vote for Shapiro or Fetterman and close to 90% of Republicans said the same of Mastriano or Oz. The 20 to 30% of PA voters who consider themselves independent voters may have been more decisive than most tea-leaves readers gave them credit for.\n\nMost polls showed Shapiro and Fetterman with whopping leads among independent voters. They may not have been the same independent voters: Shapiro’s indy supporters could be former GOP voters disaffected by Trump, and Fetterman’s indy squad could be young voters mobilized by the abortion rights issue (about half of young voters are independents nationally).\n\nThe growing significance of this independent vote in close elections may increase pressure on both parties to repeal closed primaries so that indy voters can vote in those elections. Both parties will want to have more time and opportunity to court them in the future.\n\nWith Florida ripening to a deeper and deeper Red, Pennsylvania may loom larger and larger as the most contested, consequential swing state in the country: well-worth watching as we move inexorably to 2024.\n\nDavid Thornburgh is a longtime Pennsylvania civic leader.

There was a palpable sense of excitement and urgency around the election on campus. For many young people, especially young women, there was one motivating issue that drove their participation: abortion rights.\n\nOne of the most important and contentious issues on the ballot in Michigan was Proposal 3 (commonly known as Prop 3), which codifies the right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms, such as birth control, into the Michigan state constitution. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Michiganders have feared the return of a 1931 law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, and contains felony criminal penalties for abortion providers.\n\nThough the courts have prevented that old law from taking effect, voters were eager to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution, and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 3 with over 55% of voters approving the proposal. This is a major feat given the coordinated campaign against the proposal. Both pro-life groups and the Catholic Church strongly opposed it, and many ads claimed it was “too confusing and too extreme.”\n\nThe issue of abortion was a major focal point of the gubernatorial campaign between Gov, Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon. Pro-Whitmer groups consistently highlighted Dixon’s support of a near-total abortion ban and her past comments that having a rapist’s baby could help a victim heal. Whitmer’s resounding win in the purple state of Michigan is certainly due, in part, to backlash against Dixon’s extreme positions on the issue.\n\nAfter the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, so many young voters felt helpless and despondent about the future of abortion rights. However, instead of throwing in the towel, Michigan voters showed up and displayed their support for Whitmer and Prop 3, showing that Michiganders support bodily autonomy and the right to choose.\n\nIsabelle Schindler is a senior at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy.

Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, whose campaign received $3.75 million from Nike founder Phil Knight, conceded early Tuesday night, having garnered 9% of the vote – a clear rejection of the idea that big donors can buy elections.\n\nAs Kotek takes the baton from Democrat Kate Brown, the least-popular governor in the country, she’ll confront a rising tide of homelessness in Portland. Along with drug use and violent crime, homelessness tops concerns of the city’s voters, and Kotek brings to Salem a legislative track-record of tackling the issue head on.\n\nKotek’s victory indicates that Oregonians remain concerned about issues Democrats focus on, with voters this cycle passing one of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. The electorate also overwhelmingly approved a measure amending the state constitution to penalize lawmakers who walk out of legislative sessions in order to stymie bill passage, a strategy the Republican caucus deployed in 2019 and 2020 in opposition to vaccine, gun regulation and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bills.\n\nAnd, in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights loomed large in this gubernatorial election, with Kotek vowing to enshrine legal protections for Oregon abortion providers and to establish a fund to increase access to reproductive health care. Against a sea of Republican-led anti-LGBTQ initiatives across the country, Kotek also makes history as one of the first two openly-lesbian governors (Maura Healey, who won the governor’s race in Massachusetts, is the other).\n\nWhen she entered the race, Drazan declared this would be “a Republican year” in Oregon and across the nation. The “red wave” Republicans hoped for failed to materialize, but they came shockingly close to taking the governorship in a Democratic stronghold. Voters have signaled that while they’re staying blue for now, the state has serious problems – and they expect Democrats to step up and get results.\n\nLindsey Mantoan, an Oregon resident, is an associate professor of theater and resident dramaturg at Linfield University.

In the end, it wasn’t – with author and political newcomer J.D. Vance defeating Rep. Tim Ryan by over six percentage points.\n\nRepublicans also swept every statewide office in Ohio, including the elections for justices on the Ohio Supreme Court who, for the first time, had their political party listed next to their names on the ballot. This will give the Republicans a dependable majority on state’s highest court, which is significant since there is an ongoing unresolved legal battle over the drawing of state and federal legislative districts.\n\nIt is now safe to say that Ohio, for so long the quintessential swing state, is a Republican state. What happened is simple to explain: White, working-class voters have become a solid part of the Republican coalition in the Buckeye State. In 2016, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump convinced these voters that the Democratic Party had abandoned them to progressive and internationalist interests with values they did not share. This shift was symbolized by the movement of voters in the former manufacturing hub of Northeast Ohio, once the most Democratic part of the state, to the GOP.\n\nThe question going into 2022 was whether the Republicans could keep these voters if Trump was not on the ballot. The Democrats recruited Rep. Tim Ryan to run for the Senate because he was from Northeast Ohio, having grown up just north of Youngstown. They hoped that he could win those working-class voters back, and Ryan designed his campaign around working-class economic interests, distancing himself from Washington, DC, Democrats and even opposing President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. Once the votes were counted, however, Ryan performed only slightly better than Biden had in Northeast Ohio. In fact, he even lost Trumbull County, the place where he grew up and whose voters he represented in Washington for two decades.\n\nOhio Democrats will face another test in two years, when the Democratic Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown will be on the ballot. Brown won in 2018, but given last night’s result, the Republicans will have no problem recruiting a quality candidate to run for a seat that, right now, at least leans Republican.\n\nPaul Sracic is a professor of politics and international relations at Youngstown State University and the coauthor of “Ohio Politics and Government” (Congressional Quarterly Press, 2015).

Davis Courtesy Dan Gleiter\n\nPennsylvanians clearly rejected the worst of right-wing extremism on Nov. 8, sending a strong message to former President Donald Trump that his endorsement doesn’t guarantee victory in the Keystone State.\n\nTrump proved to be a two-time loser in the commonwealth this election cycle, despite stirring up his base with screaming rallies for Republican candidates Dr. Mehmet Oz, Doug Mastriano and Rep. Scott Perry.\n\nAnd a lot of people are breathing a long, hard sign of relief.\n\nMastriano, who CNN projects will lose the race for the state’s governor to Democrat Josh Shapiro, scared many Pennsylvanians with his brash, take-no-prisoners Trump swagger. He inflamed racial tensions, embraced Christian nationalism, and once said women who violated his proposed abortion ban should be charged with murder. On top of all that, he’s an unapologetic election denier.\n\nDr. Oz, meanwhile, couldn’t shake his carpetbagger baggage, and Oprah’s rejection – on November 4, she endorsed his rival and now-victorious candidate in the Senate race, John Fetterman – seems to have carried more weight than Trump’s rallies, at least in the feedback I’ve received from readers and community members.\n\nAll of this should compel some serious soul-searching among Republican leadership in Pennsylvania. What could have they been thinking to place all their marbles on someone so outside of the mainstream as Mastriano? Did they think Pennsylvanians wouldn’t check Oz’s address? Will they rethink their hardline stance on abortion?\n\nIn a widely-watched House race, Harrisburg City Councilwoman Shamaine Daniels made a valiant Democratic effort to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Perry, after the party’s preferred candidate pulled out of the race. But her lack of name recognition and inexperience on the state or national stage impacted her ability to establish a base of her own. So the five-term incumbent, who played a role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, will return to Washington – though perhaps with a clipped wing.\n\nMany Pennsylvanians may be staunch conservatives, but we proved we’re not extremists – and we won’t embrace Trump or his candidates if they threaten the very foundations of democracy.\n\nJoyce M.

Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock, all Democrats, won in the Peach State. There has been a raging debate in Georgia political circles since then as to whether these races signal a long-term left turn toward the Democratic Party, caused by shifting demographics, or whether they were merely a negative reaction to former President Donald Trump. Tuesday’s results point strongly to the latter.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp, who had rebuffed Trump’s demand to overturn the 2020 presidential result, cruised to a convincing reelection on Tuesday with a pro-growth message by defeating the Democrats’ rising star Stacey Abrams by some 300,000 votes. His coattails also propelled other Republican state candidates to victory – including the Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who had also defied the former President – and helped to keep the Georgia General Assembly firmly in GOP hands.\n\nHowever, before sliding Georgia from a purple political state back into the solid red state column, we still have one more contest to look forward to: a runoff for the US Senate, echoing what happened in Georgia’s last set of Senate races.\n\nGeorgia requires candidates to win over 50% of the vote and the presence of a Libertarian on the ticket has thrown the heated race between Warnock, the incumbent senator and senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Georgia football great Herschel Walker into an overtime runoff campaign to be decided on December 6.\n\nBoth Walker and Warnock survived November 8 to fight another day despite different strong headwinds facing each of them. For Warnock, it has been Biden’s low favorability rating – hovering around 40% nationwide, and only 38% in Georgia, according to Marist. For Walker, it has been the steady drumbeat of personal allegations rolled out over the past few months, some admitted to and others staunchly denied.\n\nWarnock has faced his challenge by emphasizing his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues and occasionally disagreeing with the President on others. Walker, who is backed by Trump, has pulled from the deep well of admiration many Georgians feel for the former college football star.\n\nBoth of these strategies were strong enough to get them into a runoff, but which strategy will work in that arena? The answer could be crucial to determining which party controls the US Senate, depending on the result of other races that have yet to be called. Stay tuned while Georgians enjoy having the two candidates for Thanksgiving dinner and into the holiday season.\n\nEdward Lindsey is a former Republican member of the Georgia House of Representatives and its majority whip.

Mack Donnell Harmon\n\nIn his bid to win a seat in the US Senate, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to appeal to working class voters who felt abandoned by establishment Democrats. Those blue collar voters – many of them formerly members of his party – overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for Ryan, his strategy failed. He lost to J.D. Vance by a decisive margin, according to election projections.\n\nIt was, perhaps, a predictable ending for a candidate who threw away the traditional approach of rallying your base and instead courted the almost non-existent, moderate Trump voter. And it’s a shame. Had Ryan won, Ohio would have had two Democratic senators. The last time that happened was almost 30 years ago, when Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn represented our state.\n\nBut in wooing Republicans and right-leaning moderates, Ryan abandoned many of Ohio’s left-leaning Democrats who brought him to the dance.\n\nThat approach was perhaps most evident in his ads. In a campaign spot in which he is shown tossing a football at various computer screens showing messages he disapproves of, he hurls the ball at one emblazoned with the words “Defund the Police” and dismisses what he disdainfully calls “the culture wars.”\n\nAnother ad showed Ryan, gun in hand, hitting his mark at target practice, as the words “Not too bad for a Democrat” appear on the screen. To imply you’re pro-gun rights when majority of Americans support gun control legislation – and when your party explicitly embraces a pro-gun control stance is bewildering. Ryan’s ads on the economy began to parrot the anti-China rhetoric taken up by Republicans. And when President Joe Biden announced his student debt plan in an effort to invigorate the Democratic bringing economic relief to millions of millennial voters, Ryan opposed the move.\n\nAs a Black woman living in a metropolitan area, I would have liked to see him reach out to communities of color, perhaps by making an appearance with African American members of Ohio’s congressional delegation Rep. Joyce Beatty or Rep. Shontel Brown. But I would have settled for one ad addressing the economic or social concerns of people who don’t live in the Rust Belt.\n\nRyan might have won if he’d gotten the kind of robust backing from his own party that Vance got from his – and if he’d courted his Democratic base.\n\nBrianna N.

Tony Evers surviving a challenge from businessman Tim Michels and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson barely holding off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.\n\nIn late February, Johnson, who Democrats hoped might be a beatable incumbent, was viewed favorably by only 33% of Wisconsin’s voters, according to the Marquette University Law School poll. He was viewed unfavorably by 45% of the electorate with 21% saying they didn’t know what to think of him or hadn’t heard enough about him. He finished the election cycle still seen unfavorably by 46% with 43% of the voters holding a favorable view of him.\n\nHowever, Democrats decided to run possibly the worst candidate if they wanted to win against Johnson. At one point in August, the relatively unknown Barnes actually led Johnson by 7%. But familiarity with Barnes didn’t help him. Crime was the third most concerning issue for Wisconsin voters this election cycle, according to the Marquette University Law School poll, and Johnson’s campaign successfully attacked Barnes for statements in support of decreasing or redirecting police funding and for reducing the prison population. In the end, Johnson came out victorious.\n\nSo, with Republicans winning in the Senate, what saved Evers in the gubernatorial race? Perhaps it was women voters.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade meant Wisconsin’s abortion ban from 1849 went back into effect. Michels supported the no-exceptions law but then flip-flopped and said he could support exceptions for rape and incest. Johnson, for his part, successfully deflected the issue by saying he wanted Wisconsin’s abortion law to go to referendum.\n\nAnother issue that may have soured women voters on Michels was the allegation of a culture of sexual harassment within his company. Evers’ campaign unsurprisingly jumped at the opportunity to argue that “the culture comes from the top.” (In response to the allegations against his company, Michel said: “These unproven allegations do not reflect the training and culture at Michels Corporation. Harassment in the workplace should not be condoned, nor tolerated, nor was it under Michels Corporation leadership.”) Michels’ divisive primary fight against former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also didn’t help his appeal to women voters, especially in Kleefisch’s home county of Waukesha, formerly a key to a Republican victory in Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republicans are going to win in 2024, they need to figure out how to attract the support of suburban women.\n\nJames Wigderson is the former editor of RightWisconsin.com, a conservative-leaning news website, and the author of a twice-weekly newsletter, “Life, Under Construction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/politics/record-number-lgbtq-candidates-2022/index.html", "title": "Historic number of LGBTQ candidates are running for office this year ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA historic number of LGBTQ candidates are running for office this year, according to new data from LGBTQ Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to helping elect LGBTQ candidates.\n\nAt least 1,008 LGBTQ people are running for office – of all levels – so far in 2022, according to the group’s data, shared first with CNN. The organization, which only endorses candidates who back abortion rights, has seen an uptick in LGBTQ candidates of color, transgender candidates and gender non-conforming candidates.\n\nThe record-breaking number of candidates, which includes those who have already won or lost primaries or local special elections, coincides with a more sobering statistic: 2022 has already set a record for anti-LGBTQ state bills, with lawmakers around the country having introduced at least 162 through July 1, according to a CNN analysis of data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union. The record number of LGBTQ candidates also comes amid fears that the conservative-majority Supreme Court could target same-sex marriage in the future after overturning Roe v. Wade last month.\n\n“The writing is on the wall for the LGBTQ community and our allies: our rights are on the ballot this year. The people we elect this cycle will make decisions about what our kids are allowed to learn and say in the classroom, what health care choices people will be allowed to make about their own bodies and possibly, whether we will continue to be allowed to marry those we love,” Annise Parker, president and CEO of LGBTQ Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nThe data, which runs through July 7, comes from LGBTQ Victory Fund’s endorsement application process and partnerships with state and local LGBTQ organizations. The group tracks all LGBTQ candidates regardless of party affiliation. It does endorse Republicans, and this year backed GOP Idaho state House candidate Dom Gelsomino, though he lost in the primary.\n\nThe group has kept data on everyone who has asked for its endorsement since its founding in 1991 and started maintaining a comprehensive database from partner organizations in 2018, which it calls the “rainbow wave” because of the sharp uptick in LGBTQ candidates that year.\n\nSince 2020, there has been a 73% increase in LGBTQ people running for federal office, according to the group. There are currently 11 LGBTQ members of Congress, according to data from sister organization LGBTQ Victory Institute.\n\nThe Democrat-led House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to pass a bill that would enshrine protections for same-sex marriage into federal law, with party leadership citing the high court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade as a reason to try to codify other precedents. Senators said on Wednesday that they expect the bill to eventually win the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the chamber.\n\nBy far, the most LGBTQ people – more than 400 – are running for state legislature, compared to other offices, according to LGBTQ Victory Fund.\n\nDemocrat Leigh Finke, who, if elected, would be the first out trans person in the Minnesota state legislature, according the group’s data, told CNN she started talking about running for office “because of the coordinated national attacks against trans people.”\n\nMost of the state bills introduced this year target transgender and nonbinary people, with a particular emphasis on trans youth. Republicans have seized on the issue in the run-up to the midterm elections, predominantly in red states, while Democrats have made their opposition to those bills part of their candidacies.\n\n“Things are escalating in a very concerning way. And it was happening across the country, but we started to see very targeted, draconian anti-trans bills introduced into the Minnesota legislature,” said Finke, who’s running to replace a retiring Democratic state representative. Minnesota is among a slew of states that have tried in recent years to ban trans women at public colleges in the state from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity.\n\n“We have a divided legislature, so it wasn’t that these bills were going to pass, but the conversation itself damages my community. It hurts trans kids. It just became very important for me to have a trans person in the room where these conversations are taking place,” she said.\n\nThough a number of candidates have made clear they’re not just running to make history, they’ve noted that their identities plays a key role in their candidacies.\n\n“I’m not running to be the first,” former Oregon state House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Democrat running for governor, said in a statement to CNN. “But, let me say this: I’m really proud to be running, openly and authentically, at a moment where the extreme right is once again going after the LGBTQ+ community, especially our kids.”\n\nIf elected, Kotek could become the first out lesbian governor in the United States, according to the group. That first could also be secured by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nIn Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year signed legislation banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom, which critics dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law, Janelle Perez says her state Senate candidacy was not inspired by the controversial law but that she will always be a vocal advocate against anything that targets her community.\n\n“Given the political climate that we’re in, what a better way to stick it to the legislature [than] by sending the first LGBTQ parent to the legislature after having this atrocious bill, ‘the don’t say gay,’ where they dubbed it ‘the parental rights bill,’ but they completely ignore my rights as a parent as well and the rights of my children, and the rights of so many children,” said Perez, who, if elected, would be the first out woman from the LGBTQ community in the Florida state Senate and the first LGBTQ parent in the state legislature, according to the group’s data.\n\n“I hope that with my candidacy a lot of people that come after me can see that they can have this too,” she added.\n\nMeanwhile, in Connecticut, state Treasurer candidate Erick Russell commended those stepping up to run, even amidst an unprecedented number of anti-LGBTQ state bills. If elected, Russell would be the first out Black LGBTQ statewide elected official in the country, according the group’s data.\n\n“I think people realize more now than ever that there is no time to sit on the sidelines, that we all need to step up and really do our part. And I think that that representation, particularly when so many of our communities are under attack right now, is really important,” Russell said.", "authors": ["Rachel Janfaza Devan Cole", "Rachel Janfaza", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/maura-healey-democrat-rising-star/index.html", "title": "The next big Democratic star (you haven't heard of yet) | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nShortly after the polls closed Tuesday night in Massachusetts, the Democratic nomination for governor was called for Maura Healey.\n\nHealey, the state’s attorney general, won more than 85% of the vote; her only opponent dropped out of the primary in June, but remained on the ballot.\n\n(Sidebar: That Healey had no serious primary challenge in a state as Democratic as Massachusetts speaks to her political strength in the state.)\n\nShould Healey win the general election – and she will be heavily favored given Massachusetts’ Democratic tilt and the fact that Republicans in the state chose a Donald Trump acolyte as their nominee – she would make history as one of the first out lesbian governors anywhere in the country. (Tina Kotek, a Democrat running for governor in Oregon this year, could also join her). Healey would also be the first woman elected as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nFor Healey, it wouldn’t be the first time she had made history. When she was elected as state attorney general in 2014, she was the first out gay person to hold that job in the country.\n\nShe also went to Harvard where she played basketball. She went on to play professionally in Europe. (Austria, to be exact.) In the first ad of her bid for attorney general, Healey referenced her unique background. “When you’re a five-four pro basketball player, you learn to take on the big guys,” she said.\n\nIf Healey is elected governor in November – and again, there is every reason to believe she will be – her profile as the chief executive of one of the most Democratic states in the nation and as one of (if not the) most prominent LGBTQ elected leaders in the country would immediately make her a national figure within the party.\n\nWhich means that if President Joe Biden does not run for a second term – and I have zero insider information about when he will make his mind up on that question and what he will ultimately decide – Healey’s name is one you may hear along with the likes of Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (among many others).\n\nIf Healey were to decide against such a bid, you can be sure that her name would be in the mix as a vice presidential contender.\n\nAt 51 years old, Healey is in no rush. Even in 2028, she will still be in her 50s and at that point could well be in the midst of her second term as governor of the Bay State.\n\nThe Point: Healey has been a rising star for a while. Her ascension is nearly complete now. Watch out for her to emerge as a major player for Democrats in the years to come.\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that Healey would be the first woman elected as governor of Massachusetts.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-historic-firsts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_newsbreak", "title": "Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhile the overall midterm election results may not be known for hours or even days in some spots, candidates from both parties are already celebrating historic victories.\n\nHeading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.\n\nRepublicans are excited about growing their roster of female governors and electing more Latino members to the US House.

I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”\n\nFrost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.\n\nIllinois\n\nIL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District.

Laughter helps calm you down.\n\nThrow your phone in the nearest body of water and then hide under the bed. This won’t calm you, but it’s arguably the best thing any of us can do.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\nAs polling sites begin to close around the country, early returns are showing that voters were motivated to cast ballots. I won’t get ahead of myself because midterm election turnout has proved to be dismally low over the years. But there are glimmers of hope.\n\nIn battleground Ohio, where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces Republican J.D. Vance for a key Senate seat, early voting set a record with 1.55 million ballots cast. New Mexico saw same-day registration – the first time it’s been offered – bring in 14,000 new voters, along with 350,000 people who voted in person by noon. An additional 100,000 individuals cast absentee ballots.\n\nProjected high in-person voting and robust mailed ballots might delay results in several key races. But I’d rather wait for every vote to be tabulated, and I imagine those still suffering from 2020 election PTSD would concur. Democracy isn’t always easy and neat. But it certainly felt good to cast my ballot Tuesday.\n\nI’m seeing headlines of high voter turnout in many areas of the country. It’s our right and privilege to select those we want to represent us. Honestly, it's our duty. And remember if you’re in line and the polls are closing, don’t leave. You can’t be turned away. Please vote.\n\n— Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY\n\n6 p.m. — Hopeful that confidence will be restored in the process\n\nVoting is starting to wind down across the country so we wanted to offer up some thoughts from Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor and columnist, on what she feels is at stake for the country.\n\nWe’ve passed the midpoint of Election Day, so it’s time to check back in with my favorite version of myself, TV political commentator Les Accurate.\n\nLes, what are you seeing out there?\n\n“Well, Rex, let me tell you, this election is getting interestinger and interestinger.”\n\nIs that a word?\n\n“It absolutely is.”\n\nSo what’s the most … interestinger thing thus far?\n\n“Well, I can tell you with 100% certainty that people are voting. They are standing in lines, making decisions and casting ballots that reflect those decisions. Now, who they’re voting for is another story, because that’s kept secret. Make of that what you will. But I can say definitively that votes are being cast, and once those votes are counted, I predicted that whichever candidate received the most votes will be declared the winner. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nThanks, Les. That was of no benefit whatsoever.\n\n“You’re welcome, Rex, and … wait a minute … I have one thing to add. I’m seeing some early reports on voter turnout, and I’m prepared to guarantee readers that there is a state named ‘New Hampshire.’ You can’t take that one to the bank. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nGreat, Les. We’ll hear more from you later.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\n5:30 p.m. — Parents, businesses haven’t forgotten COVID lockdowns\n\nAn issue that I think is motivating voters around the country is the lasting frustration over how governors and schools responded to COVID-19. In Democrat-led states that saw the longest business shutdowns and shuttered schools, the effects of those decisions are still very much felt.\n\nFor instance, we recently saw the results of the Nation’s Report Card, and it’s clear that students in the schools closed the longest – often in urban, low-income areas – are the furthest behind. The teachers unions that advocated the hardest for delayed school returns are now giving millions to and actively campaigning for the Democrats (like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer) who did their bidding.\n\nThis angst hasn’t shown up specifically in polls, unlike high gas prices and the costs of milk. But it’s hard to imagine how it’s not a major consideration for voters. In Michigan, I’ve heard from moms and business owners about what their families have suffered, and they are taking those grievances to the polls.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\n'Save our kids':For midterms, GOP candidates like Tudor Dixon connect with voters on schools, economy\n\n5:15 p.m. — Expect the unexpected in South Texas\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton stumped in South Texas on Monday for three congressional candidates with seats that have been held by Democrats for decades. Key races in the 15th, 28th and 34th Congressional Districts are testing the Democratic stronghold in predominantly Hispanic areas. Hispanics have been increasingly shifting to the Republican Party in recent years, and these races could be a bellwether of a future shift, especially with former President Donald Trump out of the picture. Millions of dollars have poured in this year for each candidate. Out of the three races, two of them – the 15th and 34th Congressional Districts – are a dead heat. I’ll be paying close attention to these results in my home state.\n\n— Chris Schlak, USA TODAY\n\nKari Lake, Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, apparently has insider information about the outcome of Tuesday’s election. She’s already declared victory, hours before the polls close.\n\n“I’m going to do two terms,” Lake proclaimed to a gaggle of reporters after casting her vote. “I’m going to be your worst frickin' nightmare for eight years, and we will reform the media as well. We are going to make you guys into journalists again. So, get ready. It’s going to be a fun eight years.\"\n\nWho is going to tell her? That’s not how any of this works.\n\nI’m all for exuding confidence. But such careless hubris – by a former television news anchor, no less – is astounding. Then again, this is the same election denier who still defends former President Donald Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election.\n\nIf one says it enough times, it must be true, right? Maybe that’s her approach to Tuesday’s election: If she says she’s won, she already has.\n\nBut what sad news for the folks who live in Arizona. Lake has made her agenda and priorities clear – and they don’t include the best interests of her potential constituents. They are the real losers.\n\n— Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board: Regardless of your political leanings, our democracy needs you to vote\n\nIf you were hoping for results tonight don't get ... your hopes up. Republican lawmakers have been busy the past two years passing voter laws that will help them fight election results they disagree with.\n\nAccording to the 2022 version of the annual report \"A Democracy Crisis in The Making\" – Republicans around the country have spent many months pushing through election legislation that would make how ballots are counted more complicated.\n\nThe five tactics identified in the report include:\n\nAwarding state legislatures the power to award electoral votes.\n\nAuthorizing post-election \"audits\" that could be partisan in nature.\n\nGiving partisan lawmakers and appointed officials more powers over election operations.\n\nPlacing \"unworkable burdens\" on election administrators.\n\nIntimidating election officials with the threat of criminal penalties for certain actions.\n\n— Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\nIt was awesome to watch all the early Election Day activity focused on making sure the vote stays honest.\n\nMaricopa County administrators and political leaders in Arizona were giving instructions and reassurance to voters after minor irregularities began to surface – the kind that happen every election.\n\nOn an internal chat channel at The Arizona Republic, reporters and editors were monitoring problems and sending out journalists to inspect the hot spots.\n\nObservers and lawyers from both parties were at vote centers as cameras livestreamed activity.\n\nIf anyone had designs on rigging the Arizona ballot they were inviting a world of scrutiny. You’d be a fool to mess with this mass exercise in civic renewal. Read the full column.\n\n— Phil Boas, Arizona Republic\n\nI was standing in line to vote this afternoon when an unexpected wave of emotion hit me. Here was an election for, by, and of the people happening right in front of me. What a privilege to be able to participate. How special to witness democracy in action.\n\nI listened as my fellow citizens, waiting to cast their ballots, commented on the news media’s political coverage. “I used to watch 30 minutes of Fox News and then turn over and watch 30 minutes of MSNBC,” one man said. “It was like they were reporting about two different planets.”\n\nI smiled in recognition of that truth.\n\nIn response to the first man, another person said he still buys the local newspaper because he wants to “support freedom of the press.” But someone else said he couldn’t find the local paper in stores anymore.\n\nThe conversation turned to the fact we had to wait in line for a few minutes to vote. But I didn’t hear any complaints. Instead, the talk was about how privileged we are as Americans to be able to vote easily, conveniently and safely – in our case inside a neighborhood church’s gymnasium.\n\nWe live in a cynical age, and understandably so. Billions of dollars are spent every election cycle to scare and manipulate us and to pull us further apart from our neighbors and fellow citizens.\n\nThe best response, I think, to those who want to exploit our biases and fears is to do what my neighbors of different ages, races, economic backgrounds and genders did Tuesday: Stay informed, show up and make your voice heard in the privacy of the voting booth.\n\n— Tim Swarens, USA TODAY\n\nFootball icon Herschel Walker is arguably the most fascinating candidate in the 2022 midterm elections, capturing attention in ways even a TV doctor, a self-proclaimed \"hillbilly\" memoir writer and a Jan. 6 insurrectionist can't.\n\nAs Georgians went to the polls Tuesday, the question on many minds was whether Walker's celebrity and charm would be enough to overcome his well-publicized shortcomings and garner enough votes to force a runoff in his U.S. Senate race against incumbent Raphael Warnock.\n\nWalker, a Republican who has been polling behind other GOP candidates in the state, is expected to benefit from voters dissatisfied with Democrats based on the U.S. inflation rate and those who want the Republicans to regain majority control of the Senate.\n\nThe Georgia race is seen as one of the few competitive Senate races in the country, and with the 100-member chamber evenly divided between the GOP and the Democratic Party, some Georgians will vote for the party and not the person.\n\nPundits doubt there are enough Walker voters for him to win the race outright. In Georgia, candidates must win a majority — 50% plus one vote — to avoid a runoff, and a Libertarian candidate is expected to attract as much as 2.5% of the vote.\n\nMany consider a runoff the most likely scenario in the U.S. Senate race. A runoff would mean four more weeks of campaigning by the candidates. And who among us doesn't want another month of Walker as the candidate?\n\n— Adam Van Brimmer, Savannah Morning News\n\nWhile Democrats have tried to make the midterm elections all about abortion, in most cases, it’s a debate between the candidates’ stances on the issue.\n\nIn a handful of states, however, as I’ve written about, abortion is literally on the ballot. I’m going to be closely following what happens in my state of Michigan, along with California and Vermont, which all have measures on the ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the states’ constitutions. Kentucky also has an abortion measure but would do the opposite – clarify that there is no right to abortion in the constitution, which is what Kansas tried and failed to do earlier this year.\n\nMichigan’s Proposal 3 has been sold by proponents as a way to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, but in reality, it would go much further than that and end existing restrictions on abortion in the state. It’s the most important issue on the statewide ballot and would have long-term implications if it passes.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nKentucky is keeping a close eye on Constitutional Amendment 2 which is on Tuesday’s general election ballot. If it passes it will eliminate the right to abortion in the commonwealth. If it fails it opens the door to the possibility that abortion could become a state right.\n\nAnti-abortion activists fear the if that Amendment 2 is voted down, Kentucky will not only legalize abortion but become an “abortion mecca” by providing services to women from the surrounding states who do not have abortion access at home.\n\nWill Kentucky be like fellow red-state Kansas and vote down Amendment 2? Or will Kentucky double down on the already restrictive, anti-abortion legislative actions and embed abortion directives into its state constitution? All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday for those invested in what happens to abortion rights.\n\n— Bonnie Feldkamp, Courier-Journal\n\nWith long hours to go before the polls close, cable news networks are filling time with panels of political commentators breathlessly speculating on what’s going to happen. It’s like a convention of Nostradamus enthusiasts setting themselves up to be proven wrong, and as someone whose predictions are rarely correct, I want in.\n\nSo…throughout the day here at USA TODAY, I’ll be providing readers the gold standard in mindless Election Day speculation under my newly adopted TV news moniker, Les Accurate.\n\nAnd with that, over to you, Les.\n\n“Thanks, Rex. A lot of time still to go in these all-important midterm elections, but I can tell you, based on what I’m seeing so far, it’s Tuesday. Is that good for the Democrats and President Joe Biden? Hard to say at this point. But there’s little doubt Republicans are loving the fact that it’s not Wednesday. We’ll see where it goes from here. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nThanks, Les. We’ll check in later for another update.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\n11 a.m. — Representation matters, and we see that in the races for governor\n\nI’m closely watching several races for governor because of the demographics involved. According to Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics, 47 current governors are white (non-Latino) and 41 of the 50 governors are also men. That's a lot of white dudes in office.\n\nMeanwhile, as my colleague Ingrid Jacques has written, several candidates on the ballot could become the first woman to serve as governor in their state’s history. And in Maryland, Democrat Wes Moore would be that state's first Black governor. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Maura Healey and Tina Kotek would be the country's first openly lesbian governors. Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams would be the country's first Black female governor.\n\nRepresentation matters, and seeing these folks this close to cinching their respective elections reminds me that progress is slow and gradual. But it's also inevitable, even in the face of far-right movements that gained ground during and after Donald Trump’s presidency.\n\n— Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\n2022 midterm elections:Here are the 10 governor's races to watch\n\n10:30 a.m. — Indiana candidate was fired from office he wants to lead\n\nI think Republican Diego Morales is unfit to be Indiana’s next secretary of state. That has nothing to do with the R next to his name. Morales’ dubious record is so long, and has been so extensively covered, that you might read over it with the speed of a legal disclaimer in a commercial.\n\nMorales is a candidate who was fired from the office he wants to lead; is facing sexual assault allegations from two Republican women, including one who worked in the secretary of state’s office; and seems to have voted illegally based on public records that show him living in Marion County while voting in Hendricks County during his 2018 congressional run. Now, he wants to run one of the state’s most important offices, which happens to oversee elections.\n\nMorales is on the ballot against Democrat Destiny Wells and Libertarian Jeff Maurer. The race has been labeled a toss-up between Morales and Wells, with Maurer having a shot at record-high gains for a Libertarian.\n\n— James Briggs, The Indianapolis Star\n\n10 a.m. — Arizona primaries promote extreme candidates\n\nWhew. And whoa. Arizona’s 2022 election is just about over.\n\nSo, is it too soon to start talking about 2024?\n\nIf you are one of those who looked at this year’s nominees for governor and longed to bubble in “none of the above,” then no, it’s not a moment too soon.\n\nIf you wonder why the incoming Arizona Legislature likely will be even more conservative than the current crew then no, it’s not too early.\n\nThe fringe that has assumed control of the GOP doesn’t dominate because they are the choice of Arizona voters. They dominate because the primary election system is rigged, with a little help from gerrymandered districts, so that nearly two-thirds of the state’s voters don’t matter.\n\nIndependents now outnumber both Republicans and Democrats in Maricopa County (which includes Phoenix), and soon they will dominate statewide. Yet our primary system is designed to mute their voices.\n\n— Laurie Roberts, Arizona Republic\n\n9:30 a.m. – Whoa, Nellie! Don’t count those election wins or losses yet\n\nA survey of Election Day commentary shows conservative writers spiking the football – before Republicans have reached the end zone. And progressive writers already are lamenting their losses.\n\nIt's not over until it's over:Why some battleground states could have us waiting past election night for races to be called\n\nAs a lifelong Cubs fan, I know all about losing, but we usually wait until the final out before flying the “L” flag. So, it strikes me that both sides of the political spectrum may be premature in speculating about what may happen on this fine Election Day.\n\nIn any case, here are a few headlines that caught my attention this morning:\n\n►Salena Zito, New York Post: “Why Midterm Voters Will Put Republicans in Power Across the U.S.”\n\n►Hayes Brown, MSNBC: “The bleak reality of a GOP midterms win is hard to process.”\n\n►Chris Lehmann, The Nation: “How Democrats Should Have Talked About the Economy.”\n\n►Jim Geraghty: National Review: “Don’t let anyone tell you Democrats lost because they were too nice.”\n\nActual, real-life voters may have made those writers seem absurdly optimistic or pessimistic by this time tomorrow.

Whether you've loved the drama for four seasons or are newly interested, we rounded up everything to know about \"The Crown\" Season 5.\n\nWhen is the release date for 'The Crown' Season 5?\n\nNetflix will stream all 10 episodes of the new season of \"The Crown\" on Wednesday, Nov. 9. It comes nearly two years after Season 4 debuted in fall of 2020 (and went on to win 11 Emmys).\n\nWhat period of history does 'The Crown' Season 5 cover?\n\nThe new episodes cover a period in the early 1990s, during which Princess Diana and Prince Charles separate and eventually divorce, a fire burns at Windsor Castle, two of Elizabeth's other children divorce, Prince William starts at Eton, and John Major and Tony Blair are successive prime ministers of the United Kingdom, among other historical events.\n\n'The Crown' Season 4 fact check:Historian explains what really happened with Charles and Diana\n\nWho is playing Princess Diana, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II and the other royals in 'The Crown' Season 5?\n\nFor the second time the entire cast of \"Crown\" has been replaced as the series jumps ahead in time and the characters age. Imelda Staunton (of the \"Harry Potter\" films) takes on the role of Elizabeth this year, with Jonathan Pryce as her husband Prince Phillip. \"The Affair\" actor Dominic West is the new Prince Charles and Elizabeth Debicki (\"Tenet\") is the new Princess Diana. Also recast are Camilla Parker-Bowles (Olivia Williams) and Princess Margaret (Lesley Manville).\n\nThe series also introduces new characters, including young actors playing preteen Prince William (Senan West) and Prince Harry (Will Powell), as well as Dodi Fayed and his father Mohammed (Khalid Abdalla and Salim Dau). Dodi Fayed was an eventual romantic partner of Diana's and died in the same car crash in 1997.\n\nWhy are people in the U.K. upset about 'The Crown' Season 5?\n\nBefore it has even debuted, the new season has created backlash in the U.K. The reported contents of the new season are being criticized for historical inaccuracy, including by some of the figures themselves depicted.\n\nMajor, portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller in the show, called a scene in the first episode a \"load of malicious nonsense\" because of reports it depicts Charles lobbying Major to help him oust the Queen (the episodes are not yet available to Major or the general public).\n\nJudi Dench also has spoken out against the series in a letter to British newspaper The Times, worrying that viewers will take the fictionalized drama as historical fact. “This is both cruelly unjust to the individuals and damaging to the institution they represent,\" Dench, who received a Damehood from the monarchy in 1988, wrote in her letter. She is among other critics who want Netflix to add a disclaimer to the episodes reiterating that the series is fictional. The streamer, however, has declined to do so.\n\nWill Princess Diana's 'Revenge Dress' feature in 'The Crown' Season 5?\n\nYou betcha. The black, off-the-shoulder cocktail dress Diana wore in 1994 after Charles gave an interview that revealed he had been unfaithful to her quickly became known in the press and zeitgeist as her \"Revenge Dress,\" because of its (at the time) daring cut and style. Netflix has already released a photo of Debicki in a replica of the original dress, which was designed by Christina Stambolian.\n\nHow many seasons will 'The Crown' have?\n\nCreator Peter Morgan has said that the series will end after a sixth season, which will cover Princess Diana's death and the aftermath.

But while the TV depiction of the phone call may appear “embarrassing” for the royals, said The Telegraph, the show’s makers are “understood” to have focused on “recasting it sympathetically as two young people in love”.\n\nThe scene is “intended to show the genuine affection between the now king and queen consort and elicit sympathy at the intrusion into their private lives”, according to the paper.\n\nActor Dominic West, who plays Charles in the latest series, told Entertainment Weekly that when the transcripts first emerged, he had thought “it was something so sordid and deeply, deeply embarrassing”. But having filmed the scene, he continued, “what you’re conscious of is that the blame was not with these two people, two lovers, who were having a private conversation”, but rather with the “invasive and disgusting” behaviour of the press.\n\n“They printed it out verbatim and you could call a number and listen to the actual tape,” recalled West, who said he was now “extremely sympathetic” towards the royal couple.\n\nThe transcript\n\nCharles: Oh, God.

Indeed, there are few TV shows without CGI dragons or spaceships that can muster the kind of scrutiny and interest \"The Crown\" generates.\n\nBut much like the British royal family in the 1990s, the series is beginning to show some cracks.\n\nThe new season of \"The Crown\" (streaming Wednesday, ★★ out of four), which covers this tumultuous time in the Windsor clan, is more fine than good, blandly agreeable rather than stirringly risk-taking. Now on its third cast of actors playing the major royal roles – including Imelda Staunton as Elizabeth, Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip, Dominic West as Prince Charles and Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana – the series has the unenviable task of reinventing itself. But it also has to continue the saga of the Charles and Diana begun in Season 4 and start a path to conclude a story that didn't end in real life until just two months ago, when the Queen died at age 96. And in the wake of her death, \"The Crown\" is also attempting to create entertainment out of the royal family without offending too much. And in touchy times, people are easily offended.\n\nIt's a lot for any one piece of art to accomplish, and creator Peter Morgan does his level best to serve many masters in the 10 new episodes (all filmed long before the Queen's death). But the discombobulated series has lost the thread of storytelling that hooked so many viewers and critics for the first four seasons. It's a shame that, just as the real story is more eventful and nuanced, \"The Crown\" falls ever duller and flatter.\n\nRevenge dress to royal divorce:What to know about 'The Crown' Season 5\n\nThe season begins in the early 1990s to introduce the audience to the older actors in their new roles: Elizabeth is trying to cling to the vestiges of her monarchy; Charles is feuding with both his wife and mother; Philip is seeking new adventure; and Diana is trapped in a life that is draining. Future episodes will cover memorable moments from the decade, including Charles' leaked phone call with his lover Camilla Parker-Bowles (Olivia Williams), a fire at Windsor Castle, explosive TV interviews from both Charles and Diana and, of course, the couple's separation and eventual divorce.\n\nThe new episodes often feel haphazardly stitched together, leaving out major context and character development. The new actors either choose simple impersonations (Debicki and Staunton) or, like Pryce, make choices that don't resemble the former actors in their roles, creating the impression that they're acting in different shows. They give serviceable performances, although some of the actors (also Pryce) are woefully miscast. But none of them are magnetic; they struggle to keep the audience in thrall the way the real royals did for the public.\n\nMany, particularly in the U.K., want Netflix to add further disclaimers to the series assuring the audience it is a work of fiction and not historical fact. Producers have no real motivation to do that on any piece of historical fiction – no series like \"The Crown\" or \"Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" claims to be a documentary, after all – that tension between fact and fantasy feels ever present in the new episodes.\n\nPerhaps the best scene in the new season is one in Episode 9 that is surely all conjecture, in which a slightly wistful Charles shows up on Diana's doorstep after their divorce has been finalized and they conduct a post mortem on their relationship. No one but Charles and Diana themselves could say if that really happened, but in that moment there is no desire to race to Wikipedia to confirm or deny that scene; West and Debicki really get to act, instead of recreating news clips. Only then does Morgan's heavy-handed symbolism and metaphor succeed, and the story treats them as people and not prince and princess. The crown jewels are just this show's version of dragons: glittery sideshows that must be backed up by real character and story.\n\nThose few great moments are undercut by Morgan's awareness of his series' place in modern history. An earlier, Charles-focused episode ends with a scene and message that could best be described as propaganda for the new king.\n\nIt's not clear who season 5 of \"The Crown\" is for except perhaps for Morgan himself, an obsessive royal dramatist. Is it a soap opera about one extraordinary divorce between people who never should have been married? Is it a historical record? Is it a narrative or collection of moments? Is it playing for an audience obsessed with the royals or one that knows little about them?\n\nThe correct answer is not \"all of the above.\" Because in trying to be everything for everyone, the new season ends up being almost nothing for no one: Shiny jewels and posh accents without much underneath.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/11/17/the-crown-season-4-fact-check-historian-charles-and-diana/6226312002/", "title": "'The Crown' Season 4 fact check: A historian on Charles and Diana", "text": "Spoiler alert! The following contains details from Season 4 of \"The Crown.\"\n\nNothing gets Anglophiles googling harder than a new season of \"The Crown.\"\n\nNetflix's fictionalized series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) released a new season Sunday that tackled the monarchy in the 1980s, meaning Princess Diana (Emma Corrin) and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) play prominent roles. And while the series is edging closer to the modern era, there are plenty of historical events, royal family dramas and fashion statements that American viewers may be unfamiliar with.\n\nTo sort out fact from fluff, USA TODAY spoke with Sally Bedell Smith, author of biographies \"Elizabeth the Queen,\" \"Prince Charles,\" and \"Diana In Search of Herself.\" The historian – who consulted on \"The Crown\" creator Peter Morgan's royals-themed stage play \"The Audience\" – explains what happened with Charles, Diana and Camilla, whether the Queen had a favorite child and more.\n\nThe series indicates that Prince Charles never really stopped seeing Camilla Parker Bowles, even when he and Diana were dating and engaged. How much do we know about that?\n\nSally Bedell Smith: Charles and Camilla parted company at the end of December 1972. (They) didn't resume their love affair until late 1978. They seldom saw each other but spoke frequently on the phone. When Charles and Diana began dating, he introduced her to his social circle, including (Camilla and her husband).\n\nOnce Diana and Charles were engaged in February 1981, Charles was away frequently. He scarcely had time to see his fiancee, and there's no evidence he saw Camilla. Shortly before the wedding he arranged for more than a dozen gifts to friends – including Camilla – as gestures of gratitude. Camilla's gift was a bracelet with the monogram \"GF,\" which stood for \"Girl Friday,\" his nickname for Camilla. Diana found the bracelet and confronted him. He reiterated that it was over with Camilla, but on July 27, two days before the wedding, he traveled to Camilla's home and gave her the keepsake.\n\nThrough all the turbulence of the following years, Charles and Camilla did not resume their affair until mid-1986. That was after Diana had already had an affair with her protection officer Barry Mannakee but before she began her affair with James Hewitt in November 1986.\n\nMore:Review: In 'The Crown' Season 4, as in real life, Diana takes the spotlight from the queen\n\nIn the wedding episode, Margaret is against Charles and Diana getting married because she knows he loves Camilla. In a later episode, Charles comforts his aunt through a mental health crisis. Were they really close?\n\nSmith: (Charles and Diana) and Princess Margaret were neighbors, but Charles didn't have much to do with his aunt. Ironically, it was Margaret who showed kindness and tenderness to Diana. On the publication of the Andrew Morton (tell-all book about Diana) in June 1992, Margaret turned sharply against Diana and took Charles's side.\n\nThe series details Diana’s battle with bulimia and indicates that most of the royal family knew about her eating disorder. How open was Diana about it?\n\nSmith: Neither the Queen nor Prince Philip nor the Queen Mother knew about Diana's bulimia, nor, in all likelihood, did other members of the royal family. The essence of an eating disorder is its secrecy and shame.\n\nDiana had suffered from bulimia since her boarding school days (her headmistress and matron told me of her erratic eating habits, and shortly before her death, Diana disclosed that she had been bulimic as a teenager). The pressure of being in the royal family and under incessant scrutiny by the press triggered her bulimia shortly after the engagement was announced. Over the years, servants at Charles and Diana's homes heard her retching in the bathroom, so they were aware. Charles may have been aware of it as well. He certainly witnessed her self-mutilation several times.\n\nIn the autumn of 1981, Charles was so alarmed by Diana's rages, signs of depression and overall volatility that he took her to London to see a psychotherapist, Dr. Alan McGlashan. She only saw him eight times, but Charles continued regular therapy until 1995.\n\nMore:Why 'The Crown' Season 4 includes Princess Diana's bulimia\n\nOne episode of the new season is devoted to the Queen's meetings with all her children, trying to decide her favorite. At the end of the episode she says it’s Andrew. I’m sure we can’t know for sure who her favorite child is, but is there basis for the claim?\n\nSmith: The Queen meeting with her children to discover her favorite is a complete fabrication. It is utterly out of character for the Queen to do anything remotely like that and shows how little the writers of \"The Crown\" understand her. It has long been speculated that Andrew is her favorite child, with no evidence. Her cousin, Lady Patricia Mountbatten, told me if the Queen privately favored any child, Edward was the one (and she remains extremely close to Edward and his wife Sophie) because he is most like her in temperament and character. Lady Mountbatten's son Timothy Knatchbull told me that as her youngest child, the Queen regarded Edward as her \"ewe lamb\" to whom she gave an extra measure of love and warmth when he was a child.\n\nMore:50 best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now: 'Crown' Season 4, 'Dawson's Creek' arrive in November\n\nIn \"The Crown,\" the Queen and Margaret Thatcher are in conflict many times, and publicly when the Queen allows a Sunday Times story about her dissatisfaction with the prime minister to be published. Later the palace blames her press secretary, and he resigns. How did this episode really happen?\n\nSmith: The Queen's relationship with Margaret Thatcher was uneasy at times. In temperament they were, as the British would say, \"chalk and cheese.\" But they had great respect for each other as professional women and working mothers. They did not have conflict in their private audiences, ever. Thatcher was scrupulously deferential to the Queen. Thatcher did feel uncomfortable on her mandatory autumn visits to Balmoral, arriving in tweed suit and heels, ill-equipped for countryside hikes. This awkwardness amused the Queen.\n\nThe incident you mention occurred in July 1986 when the Sunday Times published a sensational Page One story claiming that the Queen was upset about Thatcher's policies. These included Thatcher's opposition to economic sanctions against South Africa to bring an end to apartheid. While Thatcher was furious about the story, (Thatcher advisor) Charles Powell told me she didn't think the Queen had anything to do with it.\n\nIt turned out that her press secretary, Michael Shea, had secretly briefed the Sunday Times reporter, who led him to believe he was writing a speculative story on the monarchy in the 21st century. Shea said he talked in general terms and that the reporter had \"misinterpreted\" his words.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/11/11/the-crown-season-5-fact-check-historian-charles-and-diana/10669444002/", "title": "'The Crown' Season 5 fact-check: A historian on Charles and Diana", "text": "Spoiler alert! The following contains details from Season 5 of \"The Crown.\"\n\nThere's nothing like a new season of Netflix's \"The Crown\" to get viewers to open their phones and search for the truth about the British royal family.\n\nThe glitzy drama series, which returned for a fifth season with a new cast this month, is a fictionalization of the reign of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II (Imelda Staunton), but that doesn't stop American viewers from wondering what really happened when Charles (Dominic West) and Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) got divorced or Windsor Castle caught on fire.\n\nTo brush up on our royal history, USA TODAY spoke with Sally Bedell Smith, author of biographies \"Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of Modern Monarch,\" \"Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life\" and \"Diana In Search of Herself: Portrait of a Troubled Princess.\" The historian – who consulted on \"The Crown\" creator Peter Morgan's royals-themed stage play \"The Audience\" – explains what she knows about the turbulent 1990s-era Windsors via email. (Edited and condensed for clarity.)\n\nReview:The gold is starting to rub off 'The Crown' in Season 5\n\nQuestion: \"The Crown\" has already drawn criticism in the U.K., from former prime minister John Major and others, for a scene in the first episode in which Charles lobbies to prematurely succeed his mother on the throne. The episode refers to a newspaper poll showing declining popularity for the queen and surging popularity for Charles. What really happened with that poll?\n\nSally Bedell Smith: The scenes between John Major and Prince Charles never happened – as Major has pointed out. The Sunday Times did run a survey in January 1990, and reported that nearly half thought that the queen should consider abdicating at some point. The real poll also showed high approval ratings for both the queen and Prince Charles. There was no evidence then or in the following years of any decline in the queen's popularity. It took a momentary dip after Diana's death, but quickly rebounded.\n\nRevenge dress to royal divorce:What to know about 'The Crown' Season 5\n\nLater episodes show Diana cooperating with Andrew Morton’s 1992 biography, 'Diana: Her True Story,' including sending him tapes answering his questions. How much do we know about how she worked with him?\n\nWe actually know a lot about Diana's cooperation with Morton through (her friend) James Colthurst, mainly from Morton and Colthurst's own accounts. It is true that Diana secretly tape-recorded \"her story\" in answer to questions, and those scenes come close to the facts.\n\nThe scenes in \"The Crown\" showing her reading and commenting on manuscript pages are accurate. In reality, Morton altered some of her quotes, saying they were from \"a close friend.\" It is true that Diana asked friends to talk to Morton, which gave her protective cover. They agreed to cooperate without knowing that Diana herself had been giving tape-recorded interviews. By the time of the \"second honeymoon\" in August 1991 depicted in (the season premiere), Diana was already deeply involved with the Morton project.\n\nSeason 5 devotes an episode to Mohamed al-Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed, with whom Diana later became romantically involved and was with in her fatal 1997 car crash. \"The Crown\" suggests that Mohamed hired the former valet of Queen Elizabeth's uncle, the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated the British throne in 1936. Is that true?\n\nIt is true that after the death of the Duke of Windsor in 1972, when Mohamed Fayed leased Villa Windsor, he hired the Duke's (valet) Sydney Johnson. The portrayal of Johnson as Fayed's tutor in royal ways is highly unlikely, along with the plot line that Fayed nursed his servant when he was dying.\n\nThe new season portrays a leaked intimate phone call between Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Does it accurately depict the reaction to the scandal at the time?\n\nNear midnight on December 17, 1989, their phone call was illegally and mysteriously recorded. Fragments of the conversation surfaced in a tabloid in the autumn of 1992, shortly before John Major announced Charles and Diana's separation on December 9. In the middle of January 1993, the Sunday Mirror printed the entire transcript of the Camillagate (also called Tampongate) conversation.\n\nIt created a furor and was ridiculed around the world, including a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch with Dana Carvey playing Charles dressed as a tampon. The report did great damage to Charles, leading to questions within the government about his suitability to be king. A Gallup public opinion poll showed that Charles' approval rating had declined to 4% from 15% in June 1991 when his marital troubles with Diana were being widely reported in the press. In February 1993, 38% of respondents said Charles should not be king.\n\nIn the months after the transcript's publication, Camilla went into hiding, helped by sympathetic friends and family. The transcript's explicit confirmation of their affair led directly to Charles' attempt to explain it in his ill-fated TV interview with Jonathan Dimbleby.\n\nThe season shows a lot of tension between Charles and Elizabeth over Diana, Camilla and the role of the monarchy. What was their relationship like at this time?\n\nThe queen was certainly aware of tensions in (Charles and Diana's) marriage before the Morton book was published. If anything, she and Philip were more sympathetic to Diana than to Charles. Everything changed with the Morton book, which they saw as treacherous and deceitful.\n\nContrary to \"The Crown,\" Prince Philip did not visit Diana and try to pressure her into remaining silent about her marriage and the royal family. Various courtiers learned about the Morton book months before its publication, and they suspected that Diana had colluded in some way. Diana lied repeatedly about her close cooperation – to the queen's private secretary Robert Fellowes and to the queen and Prince Philip in a meeting at Windsor Castle after the publication. In that meeting, the queen and Prince Philip urged Diana and Charles to stay together and learn to compromise, to work through their difficulties for the sake of their marriage, their children, and the monarchy.\n\n'The Crown' Season 4 fact check:Historian explains the royal family in the 1980s", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/16/diana-netflix-musical-princess-spencer-the-crown-pop-culture/6100470001/", "title": "Hollywood is obsessed with Princess Diana.

The mostly sung-through show tries to distill the too-short life of Princess Diana (Jeanna de Waal) into a two-hour rock opera, with all the subtlety of a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch.\n\nIt's one of many new projects attempting to peel back the curtain on the People's Princess, to varying degrees of success. Pablo Larraín's \"Spencer\" (in theaters Nov. 5) is already garnering Oscar talk for Kristen Stewart's transformative performance. Season 4 of Netflix's \"The Crown\" featured the award-winning Emma Corrin as Lady Di, who will be played by Elizabeth Debicki in the drama's fifth season.\n\nMore:They closed on opening night due to COVID; here's how 'Six' bounced back to rule Broadway\n\nThese follow less memorable portrayals: Naomi Watts' critically savaged 2013 biopic \"Diana,\" and Bonnie Soper, who appeared in flashbacks as the Princess of Wales in 2018's made-for-TV movie \"Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance.\"\n\n\"We've never been able to get enough of this woman,\" says Boston University history professor Arianne Chernock. From \"The Crown\" to \"Spencer,\" \"this fresh batch of dramatizations doesn't help (Prince) Charles particularly, but they do help her sons. They certainly helped humanize William and show that he is trying to assert some of her values. Harry and William have both used their very privileged positions to shine a light on pressing social issues. And to do that not so much in the name of their mother, but in her spirit.\"\n\nThe projects continue with CNN's \"Diana\" (Sundays, 9 EDT/PDT), a six-part docuseries exploring Diana's legacy and influence. PBS debuted a new documentary about Lady Diana this summer, as part of the network's \"In Their Own Words\" series. And earlier this year, it was reported that Harry, who perhaps has the most license to discuss his mother's interior life, signed a four-book deal worth $20 million with publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n\"The high price of the book deal signed by Prince Harry will doubtless have been driven up by the fact that she will feature in his memoir,\" says Jonathan Sacerdoti, a British journalist and royal commentator. \"Diana’s image can still bring in the bucks, even all these years after her death.\"\n\nThe musical is a 'crude and obnoxious caricature' of Lady Di\n\nWhether \"Diana\" can bring audiences back to Broadway remains to be seen. Netflix's taped production has a dire 8% positive reviews on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, and critics weren't much kinder to the show's San Diego production in 2019.\n\nDespite some hooky melodies, the over-earnest musical is hampered by laughably banal lyrics. (\"I could use a prince to save me from my prince\" and \"Serves me right for marrying a Scorpio\" are just two of Diana's more egregious musings.) Diana's emotional real-life crusade to destigmatize HIV/AIDS turns into a borderline offensive hospital visit with gay stock characters, who bemoan not having eyeliner and throw shade at her outfit. (\"I'm sick, but not blind!\" one says.)\n\nThe princess is frequently sidelined in her own musical by Camilla Parker Bowles (Erin Davie), longtime mistress and now wife to Princes Charles (Roe Hartrampf). Their soapy love triangle culminates in a birthday party smackdown between the two women, as a group of onlookers chants, \"It's the 'Thrilla in Manila' but with Diana and Camilla / So hold onto your hats, these cats are gonna fight.\"\n\n\"Diana\" is \"so bad, it has made many wonder if it was deliberately comedic, but it seems it was intended as a serious presentation of her life,\" Sacerdoti says. \"It was disrespectful to the royal family and the Queen, as well as to Diana herself. It's a crude and obnoxious caricature of reality.\"\n\nCrass, yes, \"but it struck me as the ultimate American narrative,\" Chernock says of the show, which was co-created by Joe DiPietro and Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan. They were more focused on rhyming lyrics than \"mapping those emotions onto real people caught in a real political system. Or as Harry would say, 'trapped.' \"\n\nThe musical clumsily attempts to critique the public's appetite for all things Diana, who was killed in a 1997 car crash moments after being chased by paparazzi. (\"All you sots can't get enough,\" a chorus of royal staffers sings directly to the audience. \"Have you no shame?\") But the message ultimately rings hollow coming from a show as gaudy and sensationalized as this.\n\nKristen Stewart will next emulate Diana in 'Spencer'\n\nThe best depictions of Diana, who died at 36, have been projects that capture her playful spirit and zest for life.\n\n\"Spencer\" all but throws away the history books, imagining a single weekend in the life of the reluctant royal as she dreams, dances and darts across the grounds of an English countryside manor at Christmastime. At times claustrophobic and moody, the film finds joy in small moments between Diana and her young sons (Jack Nielen and Freddie Spry).\n\n\"I've been asked a lot about whether it's cool to try and tell someone's story when they're not around – somebody who was already so invaded (by the media),\" Stewart said at the Toronto International Film Festival last month. \"We really don't profess to know anything or present any new information. ... My hope is that because we made it so personal, we're not traipsing on (her legacy).\"\n\nNetflix's \"The Crown\" also presents a fiery, more nuanced take on Diana. Rather than attempt a note-perfect imitation, Corrin \"brought her own interpretation to the role,\" Chernock says. She captures her evolution \"from the shy ingenue to the much more calculating, autonomous woman who discovers her power.

The plot of “Encanto,” she says, perfectly captures issues many families are going through.\n\n“There are so many layers, so many dynamics,” Adelakun says.\n\nWhile catchy songs from “Encanto” are topping the charts, Disney’s latest animated film is drawing praise from therapists like Adelakun for another reason: the way the movie portrays trauma and healing.\n\nTherapists who spoke with CNN say they’re talking about the movie with their clients – many of whom are first-generation children of immigrants who see themselves reflected in the story, hear their experiences in the soundtrack, and are using “Encanto” to speak out about things that otherwise might go unsaid.\n\n“I think it’s going to have a great impact on society. … People are seeing this movie and they’re realizing they’re seeing themselves in it,” Adelakun says.\n\nHere’s a look at several key “Encanto” characters and the conversations they’re sparking:\n\nThe healer trying to keep her family whole\n\nDisney\n\nThe character: Mirabel\n\nThe song that stands out: “Waiting On a Miracle”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt the beginning of “Encanto,” Mirabel introduces us to the Madrigal family, gleefully describing each person’s “gift,” or magical power. We later learn that the magic and the family’s enchanted house have a darker side, originating in a traumatic moment after the family was forced to flee their home, trudge through the wilderness and cross a river seeking safety.\n\nMirabel is the only member of the Madrigal family who doesn’t get a gift. But in the end, her power is in seeing her family members for who they are and doing all she can to keep them together.\n\n“Mirabel was really the glue to the family, but no one was really seeing it,” Adelakun says.\n\nAnd it’s no coincidence that her character is someone many can identify with, says Mara Sammartino, a therapist in Fairfield, California.\n\n“Our parents come here fleeing war, poverty, violence. They come here, they establish a life, and then we’re born into this duality, and we’re not seen in one, and we’re not seen in the other. I think that’s why Mirabel’s character resonates,” says Sammartino, whose parents came to the United States from Nicaragua. “She is part of that duality. She’s the only one that’s in touch with the community. … She’s the only one that’s (leaving the house) and going out, talking to people. Then she comes back home and she’s kind of put in her place and told, ‘you actually don’t have anything to contribute.’”\n\nJenny Lemus, a psychotherapist in Chicago, says she heard feelings many of her clients have expressed for years in Mirabel’s song, “Waiting on a Miracle.”\n\n“She’s trying to communicate with her grandmother – ‘Look, this is what I’m experiencing. I want to be seen.’ A lot of times, the younger generations, what I’ve seen over the years, they want to be seen (by their families), they want the acknowledgment at least, and they’re not getting it,” Lemus says.\n\nThe perfectionist who feels she can’t fail\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Isabela\n\nThe song that stands out: “What Else Can I Do?”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt first glance, Isabela looks like she has it all; she can make flowers out of thin air and tosses her long hair like she doesn’t have a care in the world. But her song reveals how limiting perfectionism can be.\n\nAdelakun, whose parents came to the US from Trinidad and Tobago, says the message is relatable for many immigrants’ children – including her.\n\n“In my family, one of the main things is about not letting your family down … especially when you know they’ve made sacrifices to come to this country, to send you to good schools, to live in certain neighborhoods, just the importance of not letting your family down and trying to hold up to their expectations,” she says.\n\nFirst-generation children constantly “get the message that we need to be more,” says Lemus, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Guatemala. And those pressures, she says, can take a major toll.\n\n“There’s a lot of anger. Sometimes we don’t know where the anger comes from. Why do I feel so angry with my parents or grandparents? What’s going on?… You see that a lot with first-generation Latinos, a lot of resentment building up because of that pressure that is unspoken within the family dynamic,” Lemus says.\n\n“‘Encanto’ had such a beautiful way of portraying that in subtle ways. … Those of us that saw the movie and related to it, we got the message. We related so much to it. And I think that’s why it’s been such a hit.”\n\nThe sibling carrying the weight of her family on her shoulders\n\nFrom Disney/Youtube\n\nThe character: Luisa\n\nThe song that stands out: “Surface Pressure”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nBig-muscled Luisa is used to carrying anything her family needs her to handle. And her song confessing that she’s about to crack under the weight of it all is resonating with many people.\n\n“It describes what anxiety feels like perfectly,” says Lemus, whose patients are predominately first-generation Latinos.\n\n“A lot of clients relate to Luisa, who is experiencing the pressure of … carrying the burden for their younger siblings … having that pressure (of) protecting the younger siblings from their own experiences. It is eye-opening, and I’m so glad that I have clients that are very insightful and can relate to it.”\n\nSeeing Luisa’s struggle depicted on screen can help those who are dealing with similar difficulties better understand and describe their own situation, Sammartino says.\n\n“I think ‘Encanto’ gives a little bit of space for some clients. They can say, ‘Oh, well, look at Luisa.’ They’re not going to say, ‘Well, that’s me.’ They say, ‘Luisa experiences that. I feel for Luisa.’”\n\nThe family secret that goes unspoken\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Bruno\n\nThe song that stands out: “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nWhen it comes to Bruno, who’s ostracized by his family and ends up hiding in the walls of the Madrigal house so he can be nearby but not have to face them, there’s plenty to talk about.\n\nBruno’s gift is seeing the future, and his family members blame him when the prophecies come true. Some of his mannerisms have sparked speculation about other possible diagnoses for the character, who’s the focus of the movie’s most popular song.\n\n“He thinks differently. He sees things differently,” Adelakun says. “We have family members who are also neurodivergent or have mental health issues, and because they’re different, they get shunned, or they’re not spoken about.”\n\nFamily secrets like the stories that come out when Bruno is discussed in the film are a common sign of the intergenerational trauma many first-generation families deal with, Lemus says.\n\n“We don’t talk about feelings. We don’t talk about emotions. We don’t talk about trauma. It’s so taboo to bring it up, and it’s uncomfortable to even express ourselves,” says Lemus, who says she tries to work with patients to help them learn how to better communicate those feelings.\n\n“But also, she says, “without the expectation that it’s going to be taken the way we expect it to be. Because…we don’t know how our parents or grandparents are going to take those hard conversations. … Generation from generation, if you didn’t learn how to express your emotions, you’re not going to know how to communicate in a healthy way.”\n\nThe matriarch who passes down her trauma\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\n\nThe character: Abuela\n\nThe song that stands out: “Dos Oruguitas” (played in the background during a flashback showing the traumatic origins of the Madrigal family’s powers)\n\nWhat therapists are hearing: Protecting her family and their enchanted home is Abuela’s top priority. She’s obsessed with maintaining their magical powers and fails to realize how her experiences as a young mother – fleeing her home and losing her husband – have shaped her and her family. It’s only when the house crumbles and she almost loses everything that she sees her role in fracturing the family.\n\nFor Sammartino, it’s a perfect example to point to when she’s trying to help her clients empathize with their elders.\n\n“My way of trying to support my clients is to really develop a lens of empathy for their parents and the trauma that they experienced,” Sammartino says. “Like Abuela in the movie, her husband was murdered in front of her. Why wouldn’t she be overprotective?”\n\nIt’s a classic illustration of intergenerational trauma, Adelakun says – and something that’s likely to increasingly resonate as the film gets a wider audience.\n\n“As more people see this movie, or as more people talk about it, I think you’re probably going to see more people realizing they have repressed these things. I wonder how many people we’re going to see say, ‘I didn’t realize, or I forgot, but I had those same experiences, too,’ or, ‘I didn’t realize I was doing that to my family members.’ Abuela didn’t realize she was doing all this to harm her family,” Adelakun says.\n\nIn the movie, Abuela apologizes once she realizes the harm she’s caused.\n\nBut Lemus cautions there’s one thing that’s important to remember.\n\nIn real life, she says, Disney endings are rare.\n\n“We don’t see that outcome often. When we do see it, when we see the Mirabels of the world making changes for their family and making changes for themselves, it’s so beautiful,” she says. “It’s also beautiful when they do the work and when they realize they need to set boundaries in their families.”\n\nSometimes, families become estranged rather than coming together with a shared understanding. It’s a sad outcome, Lemus says, but doesn’t stop individuals from coming to terms with trauma and giving a healthy start to future generations.\n\nEven without a Disney ending, she says, it’s possible to heal.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Hashtags like #notmyariel are bouncing around social media, and YouTube hid the dislike counter on the official video after it was bombarded with racist comments and more than 1.5 million “dislikes.” One group of critics went as far as to share a digitally altered version of the teaser that featured a White woman in place of the movie’s star Halle Bailey, who they called a “woke actress.”\n\nBy now, we know it’s not unusual to see racist responses whenever a person of color is cast in a role considered “traditionally” White. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike a movie, these critics often hide their discomfort behind other thin arguments, claiming historical or cultural accuracy or, of all things, science.\n\nHere are some real arguments people have levied to protest the casting choice. The facts prove they just don’t hold water.\n\nClaim: ‘The Little Mermaid’ is a Danish story, therefore Ariel should be White\n\nThe original “Little Mermaid” story was written by Hans Christian Andersen and first published in 1837. If we’re going to dignify this argument, according to the text, Ariel and the rest of her mermaid kin are from “far out in the ocean” (literally the opening lines of the story) at the “bottom of the sea.” So, not Denmark or anywhere near it.\n\nIf critics are truly worried about staying faithful to the original story, we shouldn’t gloss over the original ending where the mermaid is instructed to kill her prince, but throws the knife away in despair and dissolves into sea foam instead. Not to mention, while the 1989 Disney version has a Prince Eric with bright blue peepers, Anderson specifically described the prince as having “coal-black eyes” and “raven hair.” (Also “The Little Mermaid,” who doesn’t even have a name in the original story, isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids live under the sea and therefore would not have dark skin\n\nCould be a mermaid, who knows. @adopamanatee\n\n“From a scientific perspective, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean.” So says far-right pundit Matt Walsh, who opined about the “Little Mermaid” casting on “The Matt Walsh Show.” He claims he framed the comment as a joke, since he goes on to say that “​​not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should, actually, be translucent.” However, the context of his comment is still racially charged, and he still implies pale skin is closer to a “scientific” mermaid than dark skin.\n\nAgain, if we’re going to take an academic look at these unnecessary bits of discourse, not all abyssal creatures are pale. Not all underwater creatures are pale. Also, since mermaids also get close enough to the surface to see other humans, if you want to look at it scientifically, mermaids would probably have a specific type of pigmentation that allowed for both a deep sea and shallow water existence. We also know that, centuries ago, seafarers often mistook one particular animal for a mermaid: the manatee, which is not pale. (Also “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids are a European mythological figure and therefore Ariel should be White\n\nNumerous Twitter scraps have cropped up with people trying to argue European folklore, or even Homerian epics like “The Odyssey,” have some sort of monopoly on the idea of mermaids. In reality, it’s fascinating to see how many different cultures throughout history have arrived at parallel folklorical themes. Humanoid creatures that dwell in the water are part of innumerable mythologies around the world.\n\nEast Asian and Oceanic folklore is replete with stories of underwater kingdoms and merpeople both good and evil, from the Magindara in some Philippine regions to the tale of the Indian Princess Suriratna or Hwang-ok that reached South Korea. Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the classic “Arabian Nights” collection, which dates back more than a thousand years, feature several accounts of sea-dwelling human creatures. In parts of continental Africa and among the African diaspora, folklore describing water spirits, oftentimes in the shape of beautiful women, are common. According to Shona mythology in Zimbabwe, the “njuzu” are mermaids who occupy lakes or rivers.\n\n(Also, not all Europeans are White. Also, “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Making Ariel Black is ruining childhoods and changing the character\n\nOn message boards and comment sections across the internet, people are debating whether a new, dark-skinned Ariel somehow negates or erases the classic 1989 version.\n\nDisney’s 1989 “The Little Mermaid” is still available to watch, own and share. The animated character of Ariel is part of Disney’s wildly profitable “Disney Princess” franchise and her name and image are valuable and heavily trademarked Disney properties. The red-haired, fair-skinned Ariel is here to stay.\n\nFar from ruining childhoods, many fans think making a different iteration of Ariel will only increase the Disney magic. Just look at the sweet reactions of young Black children and the praise of Disney icons like Jodi Benson, the voice of the original Ariel.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Videos of young Black girls reacting to 'Little Mermaid' trailer go viral 01:07 - Source: CNN\n\nMore importantly, the remake of one film doesn’t erase the existence of the previous films: 1999’s Mr. Darcy and 2005’s Mr. Darcy live in harmony with every other character from the roughly 300 “Pride and Prejudice” film remakes. Pennywise looks different in every “It” iteration, as does Frankenstein’s monster. The story of “Cinderella,” which predates even the famous Brothers Grimm version, seems to have a different remake out every year. One notable version, 1997’s “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” featured a racially diverse cast that included singer Brandy as the first Black Cinderella and Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. It aired on TV as part of the “Wonderful World of Disney.”\n\nWhile Disney has produced a very famous iteration of “The Little Mermaid,” it isn’t the first, only, or universally definitive work. No one owns the concept of mermaids or what they look like. A White, red-haired animated teenager is not the only version of “The Little Mermaid” to exist.\n\nAlso – and this is very important – “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}]}

Because the area heavily favors Democrats, he is likely to be elected to Congress in November.\n\nLeavitt, also 25, has a far more competitive race against Rep. Chris Pappas, one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in the country. But the Republican has run on her age being a strength.\n\n“We have people in Washington, DC, that have been clinging to power twice as long as I have been alive,” she told CNN earlier this year. “My youth is a strength and that is showing on the campaign trail already.”\n\nAnd on Tuesday, as she declared victory, she touted her age as something that set her apart from the crowded GOP field.\n\n“Tonight, we made history. And I look forward to serving as the youngest congresswoman in United States history when we beat Chris Pappas,” she said. “As many of you know, my youth is one of the many reasons that I felt compelled to run for Congress in the first place. Because it’s my generation of Americans – your children, your grandchildren – who are not being served well by the current state of our education system, our media and our entire culture.”\n\nLeavitt is more of a political newcomer than her Republican competitors. After graduating from Saint Anselm College in 2019, she went to work in the Trump White House. She eventually became assistant press secretary under White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. After Trump’s loss, she went to work for New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who, when she was elected in 2014 at age 30, was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nLeavitt’s victory came in the face of millions of dollars in outside spending seeking to halt her rise and help Matt Mowers, a Republican who failed to win the seat in 2020, win the nomination again. After polls showed Leavitt tied with Mowers, millions flooded into the state from outside groups like Congressional Leadership Fund and Defending Main Street, including in attack ads that called her “woke,” “immature” and “irresponsible.”\n\nThose Republican groups believed Mowers, not Leavitt, would be best positioned to face Pappas. A Mowers victory would have meant a rematch of their 2020 race, which Mowers lost by 5 percentage points.\n\nLeavitt’s victory is proof of the effectiveness of mimicking Trump’s style and political aggression in GOP primaries. Both Republicans worked for Trump – Leavitt in the White House and Mowers during the campaign and at the State Department – but where Mowers attempted to walk a fine line in his embrace of Trump, Leavitt was more brash.\n\nMowers’ caution opened the door for Leavitt, and turned the race into one as much about style as it was about substance. Both Mowers and Leavitt centered their campaigns on the same policy that helped elect the former President, but the upstart winner was unabashed about her support for the former President, especially on the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nEarlier this month, when Mowers was asked if he had confidence in elections, the candidate said, “I have confidence in New Hampshire elections,” but added that there was space to “get better.”\n\nLeavitt unloaded on Mowers for the answer, saying, “The 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” and accusing Mowers of siding with Biden in believing the Democratic President “legitimately won more votes than Donald Trump.”\n\nLeavitt told CNN earlier in the year that her candidacy and possible victory would show the impact younger voters could have.\n\n“The Republican Party,” she said, “needs to support, recruit and encourage young candidates because we are losing with young voters.”", "authors": ["Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-historic-firsts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_newsbreak", "title": "Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhile the overall midterm election results may not be known for hours or even days in some spots, candidates from both parties are already celebrating historic victories.\n\nHeading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.\n\nRepublicans are excited about growing their roster of female governors and electing more Latino members to the US House.

Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a harsh Trump critic, Barrett was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence. Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep.

Tony Evers won a heated re-election battle against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll last week had them tied at 48%.\n\nEvers won the governor’s office by a thin margin in 2018 when he defeated Republican Scott Walker, a 2016 presidential candidate. Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates:Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer, like many other Democrats, emphasized abortion rights throughout the campaign and criticized Dixon for her no-exceptions stance on the procedure.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nPreviously:Michigan Gov.

Fetterman and Oz have been vying for the open seat created by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement.\n\n\"It's official. I will be the next U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTexas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez reelected to House\n\nRep.

But Gonzalez’ win is a blow to those efforts.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nNo victory or concession speeches tonight from Nevada Democrats\n\nJust as the crowd doubled in size at the Democratic ticket's election party on the Las Vegas Strip, Nevada's top candidates took the stage to thank their supporters – and encourage them to \"go home.\"\n\nSen.

Henry Cuellar won reelection Tuesday, fending off an aggressive play by Republicans to remake the U.S.-Mexico border into a midterm battleground.\n\nCuellar’s victory over Republican Cassy Garcia holds the line for Democrats in an important stronghold for the party. Garcia was one of three Republican Latina candidates who ran competitive House races along the border after the GOP made inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020.\n\nCuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House and narrowly survived a primary challenge this spring from a progressive challenger.\n\n– Paul J.

She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race. She initially hoped to run on the Republican ticket, and is among those that have questioned the validity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Laura Bargfeld, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrats win in Hawaii Senate, governor’s races\n\nDemocrats easily won their races for the U.S. Senate and governorship in Hawaii.\n\nJosh Green overcame Republican challenger Duke Aiona for governor, while Sen.

Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nIt’s also a bellwether for which way national tides are turning on Election Day. The Senate seat has been occupied since 2011 by Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who’s retiring.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Patty Murray wins reelection to Senate\n\nDemocratic Washington Sen.

Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria unseated by Jennifer Kiggans\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans unseated incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., Tuesday in Virginia's 2nd District, which gained a more Republican tilt in redistricting but was still considered a toss-up.\n\nBoth Luria and Kiggans are Navy veterans who campaigned on promises to fight for defense and veterans issues.\n\nKiggans, who currently represents Legislative District 7 in the Tidewater region of the state, positioned herself as the candidate to restore American strength that she said has been injured by the policies of the Biden administration - policies she said Luria continually backed.\n\nLuria, a two-term House member, is also a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. A main thrust of her campaign was what she called Kiggans' failure to discuss her stance on results of the 2020 election.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nDoes early good news for Dems mean a red tsunami isn't materializing?\n\nTwo vulnerable House Democrats in Virginia swing districts appeared to be on their way to victories, perhaps signaling that a red tsunami many predicted isn’t materializing.\n\nCNN and NBC projected that U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Yesli Vega in the state’s 7th congressional district, a fiercely fought battleground, while Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., was the projected winner over Republican Hung Cha in the 10th congressional district.\n\n“I’m still waiting for the Red Wave to arrive,” veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberger said on Twitter. “It may still come, but I have not seen it yet. That does not mean the Rs won’t win the House and Senate.”\n\nRepublicans picked up a third battleground seat in Virginia, however, with CNN projecting Jen Kiggans defeated Rep.

But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959.

He is a former state representative who cast himself as someone willing to take the fight to the status quo. Shapiro defended the state’s presidential election results in 2020 against an onslaught of legal challenges.\n\nMastriano, a state senator and retired Army colonel, marched on the U.S. Capitol in the Jan. 6 attack and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who visited the state to rally for him.\n\nMastriano supported unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and held a hearing featuring Rudy Giuliani and Trump, via call-in, hyping voting irregularities.\n\n- Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan wins reelection to U.S. Senate\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., beat back Trump-endorsed Republican challenger Don Bolduc in a race that narrowed sharply in the final days despite the state being carried by President Joe Biden in 2020, according to ABC and NBC News\n\nHassan, who served as governor from 2013 until she entered the Senate in 2017, tried to distance herself from the president throughout her campaign. She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September. In October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stopped funding Bolduc’s campaign to prioritize other battleground states.\n\n– Ryan Knappenberger\n\nProgressive activist becomes first Gen Z-er to be elected to Congress\n\nA former March for Our Lives and ACLU activist, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, 25, won his election bid against Republican Army veteran Calvin Wimbish to represent Florida's 10th Congressional District, which includes the Orlando area.

Greg Abbott won reelection, besting former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who had sought to ride what he and other Democrats hoped would be a wave of registered Democratic voters to victory in the long deep-red state, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe race drew national attention for O'Rourke, who lost a bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and made a brief presidential run in 2020. O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.

And the GOP overwhelmingly outspent Democrats to hammer this message across.\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist centered his campaign on a pledge to protect abortion rights in his fight with Gov.

A harbinger of Tuesday’s doom for Democrats was that Republicans held a more than 300,000-voter edge in combined early voting and mail-in ballots going into Election Day.\n\nDeSantis was intent on proving his victory in 2018 by less than 33,000 votes was no fluke. And he pushed GOP get-out-the-vote efforts and campaigned before large, supportive crowds in a final week dash around the state knowing that a blowout win would give him the bounce he needs to maybe launch a presidential campaign.

While O’Rourke talked with a ring of supporters, far-right agitators jostled with onlookers and tried to disrupt the candidate’s speech, with little success.\n\nThe handful of anti-O’Rourke onlookers shouted statements about pedophilia and transgender rights that have become a refrain of the extremist right in Texas in recent months. Despite some high-spirited discussions with the candidate’s supporters, the hecklers were unable to push past them and get close to O’Rourke, who spoke to the crowd for about an hour.\n\nTransgender rights have become a political lightning rod in Texas, which has also seen a surge in protests and attacks on LGBTQ-friendly events such as family friendly drag shows. O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L. Hughley Show” when asked about his message to Black Americans who are still on the fence about voting.\n\nMAGA Republicans are “a different breed of cat,” Biden said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday morning. “They care about your community about as much as … well, anyway,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “You’ve seen what you’ve got from that community,” he added.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race: Ted Budd supporters optimistic at polls\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – North Carolina has never elected a woman of color to the U.S. Senate, and many voters don't expect that to change Tuesday.\n\nSupporters of Democrat Cheri Beasley say they are not exactly confident, but some remain hopeful: \"Some of the underdogs come out on top!\" said Jannet Blue, 58, a Department of Motor Vehicles supervisor who voted in Winston-Salem.\n\nBackers of Republican Ted Budd are more confident; his poll lead has grown in recent weeks, and voters said it just feels like a Republican year in the Tar Heel State. \"We need to keep working people working,\" said James Wilcox, 61, a Winston-Salem businessman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nArizona voting machines: Maricopa County resolves ballot tabulation issues at some locations\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department found a solution for tabulation issues that affected about 60 of the county’s 223 voting centers, the county government said Tuesday.\n\nPrinters at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on ballots, according to Maricopa County’s official Twitter. To resolve the issue, county technicians changed the printer settings. The solution has so far worked at 17 locations and technicians have been deployed to the remaining locations to resolve the issue, according to the county.\n\nStephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, issued an apology to voters on his personal Twitter, promising that “every legal vote will be tabulated.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nPhiladelphia voting ‘going great’ so far\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tuesday has been a “wonderful” day for voting in the city, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\n“It’s going great,” he told USA TODAY. “Nothing has risen to a level of concern.”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of voters have been able to cast ballots without incident and the processing has been “going smoothly,” Custodio said.\n\nPolls are open until 8 p.m. and voters can turn in mailed ballots until that time in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFor some in New Hampshire, Biden’s stake in democracy gets through\n\nBEDFORD, N.H. – For some in New Hampshire, where presidential candidates flock every four years, President Joe Biden’s message that democracy is at stake resonated with some voters.\n\nJonathan French says it’s why he’s voting for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power.

Voters and children playing in the area were escorted into the voting room, he said, and the doors were shut.\n\nLibrary staff declined to comment on the incident. Police would not confirm whether a knife was involved, saying only that someone was taken into custody following a disturbance in which no one was injured. Voting at the library was disrupted for about 30 minutes, the poll worker said, but has since returned to normal operations.\n\n– Lawrence Andrea\n\nGet your 2022 live midterm election results here\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are underway and American voters are hitting the polls to elect members of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as governors in certain states.\n\nFollow our live coverage for Senate results, House results and gubernatorial results begin to roll in. You can also learn how to vote and who's on the ballot in your state.\n\nCybersecurity officials: Still no specific or credible threat to disrupt election operations\n\nTwo senior U.S. cybersecurity officials said Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Homeland Security continues to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure or election day operations, and that it remains vigilant to protect against foreign nation disinformation and malign influence operations.\n\nThe officials, both with DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA, noted that there have been a few isolated issues arising from within the 8,800 or so individual election jurisdictions in the United States, including Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\nBut they described them as nothing out of the ordinary and said CISA was in close touch with elected officials there and elsewhere across the country in order to understand and respond to any election day problems if needed.The officials, both speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing cybersecurity operations, referred questions about Maricopa County to local officials there, who have released statements and a video explaining how the voting machinery works.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nVoting rights group: Overvoting in NH causes some concerns\n\nDERRY, N.H. – In New Hampshire, some voters are filling out more names than they should on their ballot, forcing their ballot to be hand recounted rather than being read by a machine. Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife. Most recently, allegations surfaced that he pressured former girlfriends to have abortions, which he has denied.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMark Kelly, Blake Masters set for final pitch in Arizona Senate race\n\nOn one side is Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 1.5% as of 1 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also up by more than 1%.\n\nStocks tend to perform better when in a divided Congress gridlock since it can restrict government spending and hold up new legislation that can negatively impact stocks, analysts said.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald and Medora Lee\n\nMore debates is what some voters wanted\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. — Coming out of his polling place in DeKalb County, voter Gregory Ewing said what was most aggravating during the 2022 midterms was the lack of debates.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported in September many candidates sought to avoid each other in some of the most high-profile races.\n\nEwing said Georgians deserved more chances to see a direct contrast between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker on stage in the final weeks of the race.\n\n“It’s hard to know what the truth is with these ads. The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov. Greg Abbott faces Beto O’Rourke\n\nTexans have their eye on the marquee race for governor: incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott runs against Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke caught the attention of the state and nation after running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. Abbott is fighting for a third term.\n\nAbbott has led ahead of O’Rourke in Texas polls; margins sometimes reach single digits. On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation. O’Rourke’s final ad ahead of Election Day centered around his support for abortion access.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\nBiden spending Election Day at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is spending Election Day at the White House with no public events on his schedule.\n\nThe White House said he dropped in on a virtual phone bank by the Democratic National Committee to thank staff and volunteers and taped a radio interview targeted at Black Americans.\n\nThe president has already cast his midterm ballot. Accompanied by one of his granddaughters, a first-time voter, Biden voted in Wilmington, Delaware, on Oct. 29.\n\nBiden is expected to address the nation about the election results on Wednesday, though they are likely to be incomplete at that point.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump says he voted for DeSantis, hints again at presidential run\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he voted Tuesday morning for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, while also dropping more hints that he’ll soon declare a third run for the White House, according to media reports.\n\nTrump spoke to the media after he cast his vote at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on Tuesday morning, according to video posted by the local CBS news station CBS12. Former first lady Melania Trump joined him. \"No matter who you vote for, you have to vote,\" Trump told a sparse crowd outside the polling station.\n\nTrump also repeated that he’ll be making an announcement a week from today at his Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, though he didn't say about what. \"I think Tuesday will be a very exciting day for a lot of people,” Trump said, adding that, “The country has gotten very bad.

She faces developer Rick Caruso, a billionaire Republican turned Democrat, who has campaigned on a platform of change.\n\nThe winner fills the seat of embattled Democrat Eric Garcetti, whose nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India is stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe election comes just weeks after City Hall was embroiled in a racism scandal that led to the ouster of the City Council president and urgent calls for the resignation of two more members.

That's double the estimate the county provided earlier in the day.\n\n\"We’re doing what we can to get these back online. It’s not like both of the tabulators are having these issues. It may only be one (at a location),\" Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday morning during an impromptu news conference.\n\nMaricopa County has 223 voting centers.\n\nVoters at impacted sites have two options: to cast their ballot via a secure box to be counted later or to go vote at a different location. Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said poll workers are best equipped to help voters ensure their ballot is successfully cast.\n\n“It’s important for voters to talk to the poll workers on site,” Gilbertson said.\n\n— Anne Ryman and Sasha Hupka\n\nVirginia voters can register today, then vote\n\nVirginia’s same-day voter registration law went into effect last month.

Voting numbers tell the story\n\nMiami-Dade County is one of the biggest and most coveted prizes for any statewide candidate in Florida, and Democrats have owned it for years.\n\nConsider the fact that Miami-Dade hasn’t voted for a Republican since 1988 and hasn’t backed a Republican governor since 2002. That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS:Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, is out of touch in accusing him of being “extreme” and an “election-denier,” saying he will concede the election Tuesday if he loses.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, made those remarks after voting at the Stratham Memorial School in the town where he lives.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nVoting begins smoothly in contested Nevada Senate race\n\nAt the Desert Breeze Community Center outside Las Vegas, approximately 100 people waited in line as the polls opened at 7 a.m. Robert Streat, 73, was among the first to cast a ballot, a personal in-person voting tradition he said dates back decades.\n\nStreat said he opposes Biden's agenda and worries the country is changing too fast from the values he helped defend in Vietnam. He said he supported Republican candidates in the election.\n\n“This country is going to hell if we don’t change it. We’ve got too many people who hate it,\" he said. “We should control the government but we’ve lost it.”\n\nBut Jonathan Copeland, 55, said he worries that Republican control of the House and Senate would mean further erosion of abortion rights, which he supports. Copeland said he voted to help defend the seat of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat in danger of losing to Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. A Laxalt victory would help flip the Senate to Republican control.\n\n\"What politician has the right to tell a woman what to do?\" Copeland said.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nElection watchdog Common Cause reports routine polling problems in battleground states\n\nCommon Cause officials reported during a 10 a.m. news conference routine problems with voting in battleground states, but urged voters who cast ballots by mail to track them and make sure they were counted.\n\nAmy Keith, program director for Common Cause in Florida, said more than 15,000 absentee ballots were flagged by Thursday for problems such as a missing signature. Voters have until Thursday at 5 p.m. to fix the problems, but with a tropical storm hurtling toward the state, Keith urged voters to vote move briskly.\n\nShe said 2.2 million voters voted early in person and another 2.5 million voted early by mail.\n\n“Floridians are coming out to have their voices heard,” Keith said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials see no attacks on election infrastructure yet\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials so far have seen no indications of direct attacks on election infrastructure across the United States in the early hours of mid-term voting Tuesday. But they remain on high alert to disinformation operations and efforts to sway voters’ opinions by nation-states such as Russia, China and Iran, a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters.\n\nThe senior CISA official said those three nations continue to use the election disinformation playbook they have in past elections, and that CISA will continue to support election officials nationwide to any risks that may arise because of them.\n\nIn the first of three election security media briefings scheduled for Tuesday, the official would not say whether such foreign disinformation efforts are worse than in past election cycles, but confirmed that CISA is especially on guard against Russian malign influence campaigns following yesterday’s claim by sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that the Kremlin has meddled in U.S. elections and will continue to do so.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nNew Hampshire governor: Trump announcing 2024 run soon comes at 'worst time'\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican running for reelection, was one of the first in line to cast his ballot, and when asked about reports former President Donald Trump is expected to announce a 2024 presidential run, he said it seemed like poor timing.\n\n“Anyone who thinks it’s a smart idea to announce an election, a potential presidential bid, after (Tuesday’s) election but before Christmas, is just the worst time you could possibly do it,” Sununu said. “My sense is the former president needs better advisers if that’s really what his strategy’s going to be.”\n\nAs he has crisscrossed the country to campaign for Republican midterm candidates, Trump has increasingly hinted that he may launch a 2024 White House bid soon after the midterms. At a Monday night rally in Dayton, Ohio, he told supporters he was planning a \"very big announcement\" on Nov. 15 from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nThere's a reason for all those negative campaign ads...\n\nOn Election Day 2022, Americans are unhappy with the present, pessimistic about the future and not fully enamored with either political party. Their anxious, angry mood helps explain why campaign appeals have mostly turned not on aspirational promises – on exploring space or ending poverty, say – but on ominous warnings about the dangers of supporting the other side.\n\n\"Probably not since even the Civil War (has there been) such a dire situation for our democracy as we are in the current day,\" said John Mark Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.\n\nLessons learned in the midterms include those on the importance of the economy and the emergence of the extremes, among others.

Issue 2 would prohibit noncitizens from voting, proposing that only adult U.S. citizens who legally reside and are registered to vote in Ohio for at least 30 days can cast a ballot in future state and local elections.\n\nThe most high-profile race in the state is the contest between Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan that will help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate. Voters will also choose between incumbent Republican Gov.

Mondaire Jones, one of the first openly gay Black members of Congress, was ousted by former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman in the Tuesday primary for New York’s 10th Congressional District.\n\nJones, a freshman, earned just 18.2% of the vote, falling behind both Goldman (25.8%) and New York State Rep. Yuh-Line Niou (23.7%). The primary was a crowded field, with nine other candidates also running for the spot.\n\nJones represents the New York suburbs but decided to run in a city-based district after new congressional boundaries were drawn.\n\nGoldman, who received the New York Times’ endorsement, served as counsel to House Democrats in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment inquiry. Jones was backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called him \"a respected progressive voice on Capitol Hill and a relentless fighter for working families.\"\n\nOklahoma state legislator who wished for gay stoning loses\n\nRepublican Scott Esk, the Oklahoma state legislator who previously made violent remarks against gay people, lost his primary against Gloria Banister for a state House seat.\n\nBanister fended off Esk with 57.9% of the vote to Esk's 42.1%, with 99% of the vote counted.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the race, Esk drew headlines for old Facebook comments he made in which he wrote that gay people are \"worthy of death\" and \"we would be totally in the right\" to stone them.

Because Inhofe is retiring early, Mullin will serve the remaining four years left on Inhofe’s term.\n\n“Thank you for giving our family this opportunity,” Mullin, 45, said at a watch party in Tulsa, surrounded by his wife and six children. “It’s not just me you’re electing.

Sean Patrick Maloney narrowly prevailed against state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi in the Democratic primary for U.S. House.\n\nMaloney had received about two-thirds of the vote when the race was called by the Associated Press, leading Biaggi 66.7%-33.3% with just under half the votes counted.\n\nThe race was mired in intraparty controversy from the start. When New York’s congressional districts were redrawn, Maloney’s district was split between the 17th and 18th districts, and his home was drawn into the 17th. He chose to run in the new map’s 17th congressional district, which pushed out that district’s incumbent, rising progressive star Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nJones moved to another part of New York City and is running in a newly drawn district. But the shuffle drew frustration from progressives, who put up a primary opponent for Maloney.\n\nBiaggi had the backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said that Biaggi “knows what it takes to go up against powerful opponents.” Maloney, who is also chair of the Democratic party’s fundraising committee, acknowledged last month that he could have \"handled it a lot better,\" according to Daily News.\n\n—Ella Lee\n\nText with USA TODAY politics: Elections news right on your phone, from our top reporters\n\nNadler prevails against Maloney in heated battle after redistricting\n\nNew York voters chose Rep. Jerry Nadler over Rep.

Both candidates chair House committees — Nadler the House Judiciary Committee, and Maloney the House Oversight Committee — and have staunchly liberal voting records.\n\n—Ella Lee\n\nGet politics news right in your inbox.Subscribe here to receive OnPolitics.\n\nGOP Rep. Webster narrowly beats Laura Loomer in Florida\n\nIncumbent Florida Republican Rep. Dan Webster narrowly defeated Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur in Florida who’s been banned on some social media networks because of anti-Muslim and other remarks.\n\nThe race was unexpectedly tight; Webster received 50.7% of the vote to Loomer’s 44.5%, with just over 95% of votes counted.\n\nLoomer, a nationally known activist who sought to align herself with former President Donald Trump unsuccessfully ran for the House in 2020 for a Palm Beach-area seat that includes Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort.

DeSantis only cares about the White House,” Crist said. “He doesn’t care about your house.”\n\nDeSantis is thought to be mounting a 2024 presidential campaign, raising the stakes of Florida’s gubernatorial race this fall for Democrats who hope to snuff out his aspirations early on.\n\nCrist previously served as Florida’s Republican governor more than a decade ago before switching his allegiance to the Democratic Party in 2012.\n\n—Ella Lee\n\nFlorida voters pick Democratic Rep.

Markwayne Mullin, a plumbing company owner, and T.W. Shannon, a former speaker of the Oklahoma House and a bank executive from Oklahoma City, were the top two vote-getters in June’s 13-candidate Republican primary, but neither topped the 50% threshold needed to win the nomination outright.

Alessandra Biaggi, has blasted the strategy as out-of-touch for that and other reasons.\n\n“Just weeks ago Sean Patrick Maloney asked for DCCC donations to protect Roe — and then used the money to prop up an anti-choice election denier in Michigan,” Biaggi said in an Aug. 16 tweet.\n\n“Voters are tired of DC politicians demanding donations and lying about where the money will go.”\n\nFor this part, Maloney defended the game plan on ‘Meet The Press’ this past Sunday, saying how his “job is to win elections” for the party and that in the Michigan GOP primary the \"weaker candidate\" won giving Democrats a chance to pick up a seat this fall.\n\n– Phillip M.

That gave Warnock 49.41% of the vote total, with about 2% of voters casting ballots for Chase Oliver, the Libertarian candidate.\n\nRaffensperger also outlined the procedure for voters as the runoff rolls out. Voters can use all three methods – absentee, early in-person voting and election day voting – even with the compressed timeline:\n\nAbsentee ballots can be requested through Monday, Nov. 28.\n\nEarly voting must begin no later than Monday, Nov. 28,\n\nSome counties are likely to have Saturday voting until Thanksgiving and on Nov. 26.\n\n- Abraham Kenmore, Savannah Morning News\n\nBiden: 'Good day' for democracy\n\nA day after the midterm election, President Joe Biden said democracy won out in the United States.\n\n“It was a good day I think for democracy,” Biden said during a press conference at the White House. “I think it was a good day for America.”\n\n“Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, American people spoke once again,” Biden continued. “Democracy is who we are.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nIt's official: GA Senate race between Warnock, Walker to go to Dec. 6 runoff\n\nThe race for a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia will head to a runoff, after neither Democratic Sen.

Clark County mailed a ballot to every registered voter this election, but also allowed them to vote in person on Election Day.\n\nThat means there's tens of thousands of votes making their way through the postal system and that have not yet been counted in the state's most populous county, leaving the governor's race and battle for U.S. Senate control still undecided. While state Democratic party officials have accepted the delay, state Republicans have demanded to know the results sooner.

USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network is on the ground, monitoring what's happening across the country the day after the polls closed.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Laura Kelly secured a victory in her bid for reelection, fending off Republican challenger and state attorney general Derek Schmidt.\n\nKelly positioned herself throughout the campaign as a moderate, pro-business Democrat, while Schmidt aimed to paint her as a liberal, Biden lackey whose policies have done little to curb inflation or lower the cost of living.\n\nThough Kansas has long been a Republican stronghold, after the state rejected a potential abortion ban in August, Democrats were hopeful the issue would galvanize voters in their favor. Kelly has been vocal about her support for abortion rights, while Schmidt has said he wants fewer abortions but respects the decision made by the state’s voters.\n\nWhile the candidates were split on a number of hot-button social issues like school curricula and transgender participation in sports, the driving theme of the race was the economy, with both Kelly and Schmidt pitching themselves as the right remedy for tough times.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nGeorgia Senate race heads to runoff\n\nGeorgia's U.S. Senate race will go to a runoff, according to complete vote counts on the state's website that show Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock finishing with 49.42% of the vote ahead of Republican Herschel Walker and Libertarian Chase Oliver.\n\nWalker finished with 48.52% of the vote followed by Oliver with 2%. The inability for one candidate to claim a majority — 50% plus one vote — forces the runoff. All precincts have reported.\n\nThe final tally affirmed what an official with the Georgia Secretary of State's office announced via Twitter shortly after 2 a.m. Wednesday, that it was \"safe to say\" there will be a runoff for the U.S. Senate.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore, Savannah Now\n\nDems take full control of Michigan Legislature for first time in decades\n\nDemocrats powered their way to control of the Michigan House and Senate in Tuesday's election, marking the first time the party secured a majority of seats in both legislative chambers in nearly 40 years.\n\nThe shift is perhaps the starkest sign Michigan voters rejected the “red wave” predicted by Republicans, instead opting for Democrats in more competitive races shaped largely by redistricting.\n\nThe Associated Press had not confirmed the results of each race, but current Republican leaders in both the House and Senate acknowledged they lost power and their Democratic counterparts have claimed victory.\n\nWhile the margins are narrow, Tuesday's midterm election gives newly reelected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's party power in the state's upper and lower chambers. That paves the way to any number of policies Whitmer and fellow Democrats failed to make headway on during the governor's first term and for the years prior in Lansing.\n\n- Dave Boucher, Detroit Free Press\n\nMichael Lawler defeats NY Rep.

Gov. Mandela Barnes, according to CNN, ABC News and NBC News.\n\nA marquee race targeted by both sides for capturing Senate control, the contest was expected to be close, although most polling in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s election favored Johnson, according to FiveThirtyEight. A Marquette University Law School poll last week had Johnson up 50%-48%.\n\n\"I want to thank my family and everyone who supported me and worked so hard to save this U.S. Senate seat,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"I will do everything I can to help make things better for Wisconsinites and to heal and unify our country.\"\n\nJohnson, a former plastics company executive first elected during the anti-establishment Republican Tea Party wave of 2010, has been one of Trump’s biggest supporters in the Senate.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nHere's what else to know about Election Day 2022:\n\nSlow vote counting in Nevada\n\nNevada's two most populous counties, Washoe, home to Reno in the north, and Clark County, home to Las Vegas in the south , were still counting tens of thousands of outstanding ballots as of 10 am pacific time.\n\n“Our message is that mail-in ballots are our new normal, and we will all have to understand that it will take several days to properly process and count mail-in ballots,” said Beth Drysdale, a spokeswoman for Washoe County, which hoped to process about 20,000 ballots on Wednesday. “It's extremely important that we follow every step to account for every ballot. We will not rush the results.”\n\nState Republican party officials on Tuesday night criticized both counties for the delay in processing ballots, saying they should have been better prepared. Democrats have been sanguine about the slow pace.\n\n- Trevor Hughes\n\nElection officials on Georgia Senate recount: It’s happening\n\nAt least Georgia election officials have a sense of humor.\n\nSecretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s family endured death threats when he refused former President Trump’s entreaties to “find” him votes in 2020. His top deputy Gabriel Sterling had to proffer explanations day after day to shoot down conspiracy theories pushed by Trump and his legal team to try and baselessly overturn the results.\n\nAnd yet, this week, facing another election with nationwide implications and a Trump-backed U.S. Senate candidate in a squeaky tight race, former NFL star Herschel Walker, Sterling in the wee hours took to Twitter to say, well, bring it.\n\n“While county officials are still doing the detailed work on counting the votes, we feel it is safe to say there will be a runoff for the US Senate here in Georgia slated for December 6,” he tweeted, accompanied by a GIF of fans watching a game in a bar with an all-CAPS caption. “THE ONLY THING THAT COULD MAKE THIS ANY BETTER IS OVERTIME.\" Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock is leading Walker by only 36,000 votes – within a single percentage-point margin.\n\nThere may be another reason for levity in Sterling’s office, though. Raffensperger won reelection yesterday by a nearly 10-point margin.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nSluggish vote counting, slim leads: What’s going on with governors’ races?\n\nFour governor’s races are too close to call as of midday Wednesday, with some sluggish vote counting and Democrats clinging to a slim leads in Kansas and Oregon.

Her father, Mike Huckabee, previously served as the state’s governor from 1996 to 2007.\n\n“I know it will be the honor of a lifetime to serve as Arkansas’ 47th governor and the first female governor,” Sanders said, to an elated crowd at her election night watch party.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn California, House Democrats are playing defense\n\nControl of the House is being held up in part because of a few tight races in California with Democrats largely on the defensive.\n\nIn southern California, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, champion for progressives, is neck and neck with Republican Scott Baugh, at 50.3%-49.7% with half of the votes still yet to be counted.\n\nJust south of Porter's seat, the same goes for Democratic Rep. Mike Levin, who is leading Republican Bryan Maryott by only two percentage points at 51%-49% with more than half of the votes still outstanding.\n\nAnd an anti-Trump Republican in central California who voted to impeach the former president, Rep. David Valadao, is fending off a competitive challenge from California assemblyman and top Democrat recruit, Rudy Salas. Valadao has an eight percentage point lead at 54%-46%, but that’s with only 31% of the votes counted so far.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky defeats anti-abortion amendment proposal\n\nKentucky's proposed amendment to its state constitution that would've ended the right to an abortion was defeated at the ballot box, making Kentucky the second state to reject such an effort, following Kansas.\n\n\"This is a historic win for the people of Kentucky,\" Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Protect Kentucky Access, said in a statement released just after midnight. \"Not only does it represent a win against government overreach and government interference in the people of Kentucky’s personal medical decisions, it represents the first time so many different organizations have come together with such an intense single-minded purpose to defeat a threat of this magnitude.\"\n\nThe Associated Press called the race Wednesday morning after about 86% of votes had been counted, with about 53% of voters against it and about 47% for it.\n\n– Deborah Yetter, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nOregon governor's race is too close to call, with Tina Kotek ahead\n\nSALEM, Ore. – Democrat Tina Kotek held a razor thin lead over Republican Christine Drazan in the Oregon governor’s race all night Tuesday, but the race remained too close to call.\n\nIn a short speech at 11 p.m. Kotek thanked her supporters, saying that it was too early to call the race.\n\nDrazan took the stage to thank supporters about a half hour later, and expressed confidence that Republicans would hold the seat when all the votes are counted.\n\nBetsy Johnson, who ran as an independent, conceded early in the evening.\n\n– Tracy Loew, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nLindsey Graham: It’s not Trump, it’s Biden\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham says it’s too soon to tell where all the chips will fall, but he knows one thing for certain.\n\n“(It’s) definitely not a Republican wave – that's for darn sure,” the South Carolina Republican said on NBC News late Tuesday.\n\nHe suggested he didn’t want to engage in a premature post-mortem of what Republicans should have done differently. But Graham, a close ally of former President Donald Trump, said he didn’t believe Trump’s campaigning with Republicans damaged their chances.\n\n“Not really,” he said. “I think it was a referendum on Biden.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nDemocratic House campaign chief trailing in New York\n\nWhile Democrats have managed to run better so far than many dire predictions would have it, the head of their campaign arm in the House is facing uncertain re-election chances this morning.\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney is trailing Republican challenger Michael Lawler 49.4% to 50.6%. That was with roughly 95% of the votes counted in their New York district. The race is still too close to call.\n\nMaloney, a former senior adviser to former President Bill Clinton, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That group – and others trying to elect Democrats – took some heat for spending money during primary races to boost hard-right Trump-backed Republican candidates, ostensibly helping to boost weaker opponents for Democrats.\n\n“My job is to win elections for the Democrats,” Maloney said on “Meet the Press” in August. “I understand that there are difficult moral questions, philosophical questions about tactics. That's always true in politics.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nIn Arizona Senate race, Kelly had the lead\n\nArizona's Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining a lead early Wednesday over Republican Blake Masters, with a sizable edge among early votes cast in Maricopa and Pima counties.\n\nUnofficial ballot returns earlier Tuesday reflected those cast during the state’s early voting period and were Democratic-leaning as many expected. Republicans are expected to dominate ballots counted later, suggesting Kelly's hold on the race is tenuous.\n\nKelly now faces the challenge of trying to hold onto that advantage as counting shifts to Election Day votes and those dropped off in recent days. That process is expected to continue for days.\n\n– Arizona Republic\n\nElection Day roundup:Texas GOP Gov. Abbott, Colorado Sen. Bennet reelected. Here's what you might have missed in the midterms\n\nFirebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert facing unexpectedly tight race\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., had a 97% chance of winning reelection against Democrat Adam Frisch, analysts at FiveThirtyEight predicted before the polls opened Tuesday. A day later, that prediction may be a little in doubt.\n\nBoebert, known for a gun-themed restaurant – Shooters – she once owned and incendiary remarks about Muslims, among others, was trailing Frisch with 49.1% compared to his 50.9%. That tally was with 92.53% of the votes counted.\n\nFrisch, a former city council member, ran on the economy and his campaign says he knows “creating good-paying jobs and fighting inflation must be the top priorities for our representative, not sideshow theatrics.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nGeorgia keeping us waiting…again\n\nWith neither candidate in the U.S. Senate race in Georgia getting more than 50% of the vote so far, the contest could be headed to a runoff in December. Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock had 49.4%, while Republican challenger Herschel Walker had 48.5% with an estimated 2% of votes still outstanding early Wednesday morning.\n\nIf it goes to a runoff, that will be held four weeks after this week’s election, meaning it would fall on Dec. 6. Early voting for a runoff would start next week, on Nov. 14. USA TODAY’s Anna Kaufman breaks down more of the ins and outs here, including explaining what a runoff election is and who’s eligible.\n\nGeorgia kept the nation in suspense in 2020, too, when both Senate races there went to runoffs and were decided in January 2021, tipping Senate control to Democrats.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nWhere does Congress stand?\n\nAs of 7 a.m., neither party can claim control of a chamber of Congress.\n\nIn the Senate, there are five seats oustanding: Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada are too close to call. Alaska's ranked-choice voting system means results may not be final for up to two more weeks. A party needs 51 seats to have the majority. Right now, the Senate is evenly split, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking ties.\n\nIn the House, Republicans needed to gain five seats to acquire the majority. Right now, there are 64 seats without a decision.\n\n– Katie Wadington\n\nKathy Hochul becomes NY's first elected female governor\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul held off a Republican challenger backed by party heavyweights eager to turn Andrew Cuomo’s downfall into victory in a reliably blue state, rallying downstate voters to become the first woman elected governor of New York. The Buffalo-born Hochul, 64, also becomes the first upstate governor in a century, dating back to Nathan Miller, who took office in 1921.\n\nWith nearly 93% of the vote counted, Hochul was leading Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Trump supporter and military veteran from Long Island who played on voter fears of random violence to cast Hochul as a soft-on-crime Democrat. Hochul garnered 52.7% of the vote.\n\n–LoHud.com\n\nIn Arizona gubernatorial race, Hobbs leading Lake\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial hopeful Katie Hobbs was ahead of Republican Kari Lake in early election results released Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.\n\nThe race between Lake, a former TV news anchor, and Hobbs, the outgoing secretary of state and former lawmaker, had been labeled a toss-up by some polls and analysts.\n\nWith 62.39% of the vote counted, Hobbs has 50.9% of the vote to Lake's 49.1%.\n\n– Arizona Republic\n\nJohnson has narrow edge in Wisconsin Senate race\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes were locked in a race that was too close to call early Wednesday.\n\nWith 93% of the vote in, Johnson had 50.7% of the vote to 49.3% for Barnes, a difference of nearly 40,000 votes.\n\n\"We've looked very closely at the numbers,\" Johnson told supporters in Neenah. \"We feel confident there's no way they can make up the gap.\" He added that he expected to declare victory later in the morning.\n\nBarnes campaign spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel said in a statement: “We always knew this race would be incredibly close.

The contest to be the state’s chief election officer, a down-ballot race that has previously garnered little attention, has gained increased importance in the wake of the 2020 election and unfounded voter fraud claims.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep.

Call it a red ripple, if you will.\n\nOhio voters decided that author-turned-politician J.D. Vance was fit for a Republican Senate seat, while Pennsylvania voters elevated Democrat Lt. Gov.

As was the economy. Some threw crime into the mix. The convergence of issues made it difficult to predict any outcome. America isn’t a monolith of ideals. Each person votes for what they believe, for what is important to them.\n\nBut what’s most disappointing is that America – Republican America – had every chance to unequivocally rebuke former President Donald Trump and his election-denying band, yet they chose to pick up instruments and play along. Their tone-deaf performances will likely keep our country out of tune for years to come.\n\nNonetheless, that is the beauty of democracy. That is why each of us has the freedom to cast a ballot.

Vance won his bid in Ohio for the Senate. But he’s far from alone.\n\nThe Washington Post has a live tracker following all these races, and while it's too early for a final tally, so far nearly 140 election deniers have won. But the truth is any win is one win too many for a healthy democracy. It's also yet to be seen what they will do when they lose, fair and square, and deny the results (as election deniers are likely to do).\n\nIn the words of former President Gerald Ford, \"Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men.\" For the good of America, do the right thing and cede power peacefully.\n\n— Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\nBrian Kemp survived the wrath of Donald Trump and the celebrity of Stacey Abrams to win a second term as Georgia's governor.\n\nFacing a 300,000-vote deficit, Abrams telephoned Kemp to concede the race shortly after 11 p.m. Considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, Abrams has now lost twice to Kemp. He beat her by 55,000 votes in the 2018 governor's race.\n\nKemp's general election triumph follows an even more convincing primary victory over former Sen. David Perdue earlier this year. Perdue ran at the urging of Trump, who disavowed Kemp after the fellow Republican rebuffed Trump's calls to challenge Georgia's 2020 election results.\n\nTrump at one point earlier this year predicted Abrams would defeat Kemp.

I said I was disappointed by their answers, but I hope I’m proven wrong.\n\nOnly Leavitt and Maxwell survived their primaries. Leavitt is currently behind in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, but the race is still very early.

Healey is the first female governor of Massachusetts and the nation's first openly lesbian governor. That's a really big deal.\n\nIn Maryland, Democrat Wes Moore has won his election over Republican Dan Cox and will become that state's first Black governor.

It included taking a walk and submerging your face in ice water.\n\nI think those are terrible ideas, so I’ve come up with some more sensible steps people can take as they ride the emotional election rollercoaster that’s likely to stretch into the days ahead:\n\nSubmerge your face in a bowl of ice cream. This is a proven stress-reduction technique, as the coolness and deliciousness of the ice cream relaxes the facial nerve endings and stimulates some gland somewhere. Anyway, just eat the damn ice cream.\n\nBuild a cabin in the woods. This is both relaxing and pragmatic, as whatever the outcome of the election, there’s a good chance you’ll eventually want to move there to avoid the upcoming civil war.\n\nWrite an epic poem that imagines Odysseus from “The Odyssey” in a modern-day rom-com set in Brooklyn, where his oratorical skills and expertise at battle mean nothing to the three hipsters he shares a flat with.

Laughter helps calm you down.\n\nThrow your phone in the nearest body of water and then hide under the bed. This won’t calm you, but it’s arguably the best thing any of us can do.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\nAs polling sites begin to close around the country, early returns are showing that voters were motivated to cast ballots. I won’t get ahead of myself because midterm election turnout has proved to be dismally low over the years. But there are glimmers of hope.\n\nIn battleground Ohio, where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces Republican J.D. Vance for a key Senate seat, early voting set a record with 1.55 million ballots cast. New Mexico saw same-day registration – the first time it’s been offered – bring in 14,000 new voters, along with 350,000 people who voted in person by noon. An additional 100,000 individuals cast absentee ballots.\n\nProjected high in-person voting and robust mailed ballots might delay results in several key races. But I’d rather wait for every vote to be tabulated, and I imagine those still suffering from 2020 election PTSD would concur. Democracy isn’t always easy and neat. But it certainly felt good to cast my ballot Tuesday.\n\nI’m seeing headlines of high voter turnout in many areas of the country. It’s our right and privilege to select those we want to represent us. Honestly, it's our duty. And remember if you’re in line and the polls are closing, don’t leave. You can’t be turned away. Please vote.\n\n— Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY\n\n6 p.m. — Hopeful that confidence will be restored in the process\n\nVoting is starting to wind down across the country so we wanted to offer up some thoughts from Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor and columnist, on what she feels is at stake for the country.\n\nWe’ve passed the midpoint of Election Day, so it’s time to check back in with my favorite version of myself, TV political commentator Les Accurate.\n\nLes, what are you seeing out there?\n\n“Well, Rex, let me tell you, this election is getting interestinger and interestinger.”\n\nIs that a word?\n\n“It absolutely is.”\n\nSo what’s the most … interestinger thing thus far?\n\n“Well, I can tell you with 100% certainty that people are voting. They are standing in lines, making decisions and casting ballots that reflect those decisions. Now, who they’re voting for is another story, because that’s kept secret. Make of that what you will. But I can say definitively that votes are being cast, and once those votes are counted, I predicted that whichever candidate received the most votes will be declared the winner. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nThanks, Les. That was of no benefit whatsoever.\n\n“You’re welcome, Rex, and … wait a minute … I have one thing to add. I’m seeing some early reports on voter turnout, and I’m prepared to guarantee readers that there is a state named ‘New Hampshire.’ You can’t take that one to the bank. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nGreat, Les. We’ll hear more from you later.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\n5:30 p.m. — Parents, businesses haven’t forgotten COVID lockdowns\n\nAn issue that I think is motivating voters around the country is the lasting frustration over how governors and schools responded to COVID-19. In Democrat-led states that saw the longest business shutdowns and shuttered schools, the effects of those decisions are still very much felt.\n\nFor instance, we recently saw the results of the Nation’s Report Card, and it’s clear that students in the schools closed the longest – often in urban, low-income areas – are the furthest behind. The teachers unions that advocated the hardest for delayed school returns are now giving millions to and actively campaigning for the Democrats (like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer) who did their bidding.\n\nThis angst hasn’t shown up specifically in polls, unlike high gas prices and the costs of milk. But it’s hard to imagine how it’s not a major consideration for voters. In Michigan, I’ve heard from moms and business owners about what their families have suffered, and they are taking those grievances to the polls.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\n'Save our kids':For midterms, GOP candidates like Tudor Dixon connect with voters on schools, economy\n\n5:15 p.m. — Expect the unexpected in South Texas\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton stumped in South Texas on Monday for three congressional candidates with seats that have been held by Democrats for decades. Key races in the 15th, 28th and 34th Congressional Districts are testing the Democratic stronghold in predominantly Hispanic areas. Hispanics have been increasingly shifting to the Republican Party in recent years, and these races could be a bellwether of a future shift, especially with former President Donald Trump out of the picture. Millions of dollars have poured in this year for each candidate. Out of the three races, two of them – the 15th and 34th Congressional Districts – are a dead heat. I’ll be paying close attention to these results in my home state.\n\n— Chris Schlak, USA TODAY\n\nKari Lake, Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, apparently has insider information about the outcome of Tuesday’s election. She’s already declared victory, hours before the polls close.\n\n“I’m going to do two terms,” Lake proclaimed to a gaggle of reporters after casting her vote. “I’m going to be your worst frickin' nightmare for eight years, and we will reform the media as well. We are going to make you guys into journalists again. So, get ready. It’s going to be a fun eight years.\"\n\nWho is going to tell her? That’s not how any of this works.\n\nI’m all for exuding confidence. But such careless hubris – by a former television news anchor, no less – is astounding. Then again, this is the same election denier who still defends former President Donald Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election.\n\nIf one says it enough times, it must be true, right? Maybe that’s her approach to Tuesday’s election: If she says she’s won, she already has.\n\nBut what sad news for the folks who live in Arizona. Lake has made her agenda and priorities clear – and they don’t include the best interests of her potential constituents. They are the real losers.\n\n— Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board: Regardless of your political leanings, our democracy needs you to vote\n\nIf you were hoping for results tonight don't get ... your hopes up.

Here was an election for, by, and of the people happening right in front of me. What a privilege to be able to participate. How special to witness democracy in action.\n\nI listened as my fellow citizens, waiting to cast their ballots, commented on the news media’s political coverage. “I used to watch 30 minutes of Fox News and then turn over and watch 30 minutes of MSNBC,” one man said. “It was like they were reporting about two different planets.”\n\nI smiled in recognition of that truth.\n\nIn response to the first man, another person said he still buys the local newspaper because he wants to “support freedom of the press.” But someone else said he couldn’t find the local paper in stores anymore.\n\nThe conversation turned to the fact we had to wait in line for a few minutes to vote. But I didn’t hear any complaints. Instead, the talk was about how privileged we are as Americans to be able to vote easily, conveniently and safely – in our case inside a neighborhood church’s gymnasium.\n\nWe live in a cynical age, and understandably so. Billions of dollars are spent every election cycle to scare and manipulate us and to pull us further apart from our neighbors and fellow citizens.\n\nThe best response, I think, to those who want to exploit our biases and fears is to do what my neighbors of different ages, races, economic backgrounds and genders did Tuesday: Stay informed, show up and make your voice heard in the privacy of the voting booth.\n\n— Tim Swarens, USA TODAY\n\nFootball icon Herschel Walker is arguably the most fascinating candidate in the 2022 midterm elections, capturing attention in ways even a TV doctor, a self-proclaimed \"hillbilly\" memoir writer and a Jan. 6 insurrectionist can't.\n\nAs Georgians went to the polls Tuesday, the question on many minds was whether Walker's celebrity and charm would be enough to overcome his well-publicized shortcomings and garner enough votes to force a runoff in his U.S. Senate race against incumbent Raphael Warnock.\n\nWalker, a Republican who has been polling behind other GOP candidates in the state, is expected to benefit from voters dissatisfied with Democrats based on the U.S. inflation rate and those who want the Republicans to regain majority control of the Senate.\n\nThe Georgia race is seen as one of the few competitive Senate races in the country, and with the 100-member chamber evenly divided between the GOP and the Democratic Party, some Georgians will vote for the party and not the person.\n\nPundits doubt there are enough Walker voters for him to win the race outright. In Georgia, candidates must win a majority — 50% plus one vote — to avoid a runoff, and a Libertarian candidate is expected to attract as much as 2.5% of the vote.\n\nMany consider a runoff the most likely scenario in the U.S. Senate race. A runoff would mean four more weeks of campaigning by the candidates. And who among us doesn't want another month of Walker as the candidate?\n\n— Adam Van Brimmer, Savannah Morning News\n\nWhile Democrats have tried to make the midterm elections all about abortion, in most cases, it’s a debate between the candidates’ stances on the issue.\n\nIn a handful of states, however, as I’ve written about, abortion is literally on the ballot. I’m going to be closely following what happens in my state of Michigan, along with California and Vermont, which all have measures on the ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the states’ constitutions. Kentucky also has an abortion measure but would do the opposite – clarify that there is no right to abortion in the constitution, which is what Kansas tried and failed to do earlier this year.\n\nMichigan’s Proposal 3 has been sold by proponents as a way to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, but in reality, it would go much further than that and end existing restrictions on abortion in the state. It’s the most important issue on the statewide ballot and would have long-term implications if it passes.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nKentucky is keeping a close eye on Constitutional Amendment 2 which is on Tuesday’s general election ballot. If it passes it will eliminate the right to abortion in the commonwealth. If it fails it opens the door to the possibility that abortion could become a state right.\n\nAnti-abortion activists fear the if that Amendment 2 is voted down, Kentucky will not only legalize abortion but become an “abortion mecca” by providing services to women from the surrounding states who do not have abortion access at home.\n\nWill Kentucky be like fellow red-state Kansas and vote down Amendment 2? Or will Kentucky double down on the already restrictive, anti-abortion legislative actions and embed abortion directives into its state constitution? All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday for those invested in what happens to abortion rights.\n\n— Bonnie Feldkamp, Courier-Journal\n\nWith long hours to go before the polls close, cable news networks are filling time with panels of political commentators breathlessly speculating on what’s going to happen. It’s like a convention of Nostradamus enthusiasts setting themselves up to be proven wrong, and as someone whose predictions are rarely correct, I want in.\n\nSo…throughout the day here at USA TODAY, I’ll be providing readers the gold standard in mindless Election Day speculation under my newly adopted TV news moniker, Les Accurate.\n\nAnd with that, over to you, Les.\n\n“Thanks, Rex. A lot of time still to go in these all-important midterm elections, but I can tell you, based on what I’m seeing so far, it’s Tuesday. Is that good for the Democrats and President Joe Biden? Hard to say at this point. But there’s little doubt Republicans are loving the fact that it’s not Wednesday. We’ll see where it goes from here. Back to you, Rex.”\n\nThanks, Les. We’ll check in later for another update.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\n11 a.m. — Representation matters, and we see that in the races for governor\n\nI’m closely watching several races for governor because of the demographics involved. According to Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics, 47 current governors are white (non-Latino) and 41 of the 50 governors are also men. That's a lot of white dudes in office.\n\nMeanwhile, as my colleague Ingrid Jacques has written, several candidates on the ballot could become the first woman to serve as governor in their state’s history. And in Maryland, Democrat Wes Moore would be that state's first Black governor. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Maura Healey and Tina Kotek would be the country's first openly lesbian governors. Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams would be the country's first Black female governor.\n\nRepresentation matters, and seeing these folks this close to cinching their respective elections reminds me that progress is slow and gradual. But it's also inevitable, even in the face of far-right movements that gained ground during and after Donald Trump’s presidency.\n\n— Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\n2022 midterm elections:Here are the 10 governor's races to watch\n\n10:30 a.m. — Indiana candidate was fired from office he wants to lead\n\nI think Republican Diego Morales is unfit to be Indiana’s next secretary of state. That has nothing to do with the R next to his name. Morales’ dubious record is so long, and has been so extensively covered, that you might read over it with the speed of a legal disclaimer in a commercial.\n\nMorales is a candidate who was fired from the office he wants to lead; is facing sexual assault allegations from two Republican women, including one who worked in the secretary of state’s office; and seems to have voted illegally based on public records that show him living in Marion County while voting in Hendricks County during his 2018 congressional run. Now, he wants to run one of the state’s most important offices, which happens to oversee elections.\n\nMorales is on the ballot against Democrat Destiny Wells and Libertarian Jeff Maurer. The race has been labeled a toss-up between Morales and Wells, with Maurer having a shot at record-high gains for a Libertarian.\n\n— James Briggs, The Indianapolis Star\n\n10 a.m. — Arizona primaries promote extreme candidates\n\nWhew. And whoa. Arizona’s 2022 election is just about over.\n\nSo, is it too soon to start talking about 2024?\n\nIf you are one of those who looked at this year’s nominees for governor and longed to bubble in “none of the above,” then no, it’s not a moment too soon.\n\nIf you wonder why the incoming Arizona Legislature likely will be even more conservative than the current crew then no, it’s not too early.\n\nThe fringe that has assumed control of the GOP doesn’t dominate because they are the choice of Arizona voters. They dominate because the primary election system is rigged, with a little help from gerrymandered districts, so that nearly two-thirds of the state’s voters don’t matter.\n\nIndependents now outnumber both Republicans and Democrats in Maricopa County (which includes Phoenix), and soon they will dominate statewide. Yet our primary system is designed to mute their voices.\n\n— Laurie Roberts, Arizona Republic\n\n9:30 a.m. – Whoa, Nellie! Don’t count those election wins or losses yet\n\nA survey of Election Day commentary shows conservative writers spiking the football – before Republicans have reached the end zone. And progressive writers already are lamenting their losses.\n\nIt's not over until it's over:Why some battleground states could have us waiting past election night for races to be called\n\nAs a lifelong Cubs fan, I know all about losing, but we usually wait until the final out before flying the “L” flag. So, it strikes me that both sides of the political spectrum may be premature in speculating about what may happen on this fine Election Day.\n\nIn any case, here are a few headlines that caught my attention this morning:\n\n►Salena Zito, New York Post: “Why Midterm Voters Will Put Republicans in Power Across the U.S.”\n\n►Hayes Brown, MSNBC: “The bleak reality of a GOP midterms win is hard to process.”\n\n►Chris Lehmann, The Nation: “How Democrats Should Have Talked About the Economy.”\n\n►Jim Geraghty: National Review: “Don’t let anyone tell you Democrats lost because they were too nice.”\n\nActual, real-life voters may have made those writers seem absurdly optimistic or pessimistic by this time tomorrow. But it’s clear there’s joy on one side and trepidation on the other as millions of Americans cast their ballots this morning.\n\n— Tim Swarens, USA TODAY\n\nOpinions in your inbox: Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns every day\n\n8 a.m. — Get caught up on things so far\n\nThis election has been filled with opportunities for analysis and opinion.

Here's what to know.", "text": "Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday signed SB46, creating a medical marijuana program in Alabama and allowing the use of medical cannabis for roughly 15 illnesses or diseases, provided certain conditions are met. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat's new under this bill?\n\nThe Alabama Legislature in 2014 passed legislation (known as Carly's Law) allowing the limited use of cannabidiol (CBD) oil in conjunction with a UAB study on its impact on children with seizures. Two years later, CBD was decriminalized for individuals with seizures or debilitating medical conditions (known as Leni's Law), though that bill specifically said it was not aimed at authorizing medical marijuana. SB46, sponsored by Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, sets up a comprehensive medical cannabis program and a new body called the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission to regulate it.\n\nWhat conditions are covered in the law?\n\nThe law allows the use of medical cannabis for autism spectrum disorder; cancer-related weight loss, nausea, vomiting and pain; Crohn's Disease; depression; epilepsy or a condition causing seizures; HIV/AIDS-related weight loss or nausea; panic disorder; Parkinson's Disease; persistent nausea \"not significantly responsive to traditional treatment,\" save nausea related to pregnancy or conditions stemming from excessive marijuana use; post-traumatic stress disorder; sickle-cell anemia; spasticity associated with diseases like ALS, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries; terminal illnesses; Tourette's Syndrome, and chronic or intractable pain that is unresponsive to conventional or opiate therapy.\n\nDATA:Where recreational marijuana is legal, data shows minimal impacts on teen use and traffic deaths\n\nMORE ON MARIJUANA:Martha Stewart, Jaleel White and more promote cannabis use: Experts weigh in on THC vs. CBD\n\nWhat are the conditions for use?\n\nA physician — who must be certified to dispense medical cannabis — must certify that the traditional therapies have failed to lead to improvements in the patient's condition. (Patients under the age of 19 must have a certified caregiver.) Once the patient has the certification, he or she must register with the state and apply for a medical cannabis card, with an application fee of no more than $65. The patient will be able to buy medical cannabis once they receive a card.\n\nCould a patient in Alabama smoke medical marijuana?\n\nNo. The law does not allow smoking, vaping or consuming medical marijuana in baked products. Medical cannabis could be consumed as tablets; capsules; gummies; lozenges; topical oils; suppositories; transdermal patches, and in nebulizers or as vaporized oil.\n\nDoes the law allow recreational use of marijuana?\n\nNo.\n\nHow will medical cannabis be grown?\n\nThe law authorizes up to 12 cultivator licenses in the state, subject to consultation with the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries. It requires medical cannabis to be grown in secure, enclosed facilities. The law also allows up to four processor licenses, to turn the cannabis into consumable products.\n\nWhere will cannabis be distributed?\n\nUp to 12 dispensaries around the state (three per license holder) could be set up, though local governments would have to vote to allow dispensaries within their borders. The dispensaries would sell amounts of medical cannabis, but would be restricted on advertising, signage and displays.\n\nWhen will medical marijuana be available in Alabama?\n\nThat's not entirely clear. A few steps have to take place first, including the appointment of members to the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (appointments have to be made before July 1). The commission will have to develop procedures for the distribution of medical cannabis. Procedures for training physicians to issue medical cannabis will have to be in place by Dec. 1.\n\nLicenses for various steps in the production and distribution process would be available starting on Sept. 1, 2022, and those interested in growing marijuana would have to show they could begin cultivation within 60 days of receiving a license. Melson and Rep. Mike Ball, R-Madison, have suggested that patients could receive medical cannabis in the fall of 2022.\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2012/11/03/kids-flumist-vaccine/1677863/", "title": "To ward off flu: Shot or nasal spray? Depends on age", "text": "Liz Szabo, USA TODAY\n\nNasal spray appears more effective than flu shot in kids ages 2 to 8\n\nDoctors: Flu vaccine recommendations in the future may be tailored by age\n\nAdults ages 18 to 49 seem to respond better to the injection\n\nWhen it comes to flu vaccines, most kids clearly and loudly prefer the nasal spray over the traditional shot in the arm.\n\nAs it turns out, those instincts are right on the nose.\n\nWith mounting evidence that the FluMist nasal spray works much better in kids than an injection, flu experts are considering whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should actually steer young children toward the less painful alternative.\n\nThe deliberations reflect a growing sense among infectious disease experts that people of different ages may get better protection from different types of vaccines, says Gregory Poland, a professor at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and an adviser to the CDC.\n\nThe CDC currently issues only general recommendations for the flu. The agency encourages everyone over age 6 months to get an annual flu vaccine, but doesn't specify which kind.\n\nAn influenza work group, part of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is considering whether the CDC should begin tailoring those recommendations, by expressing a preference for FluMist in healthy kids ages 2 to 8, says Poland, a group member.\n\n\"We've treated all flu vaccines the same, but they are not,\" says Arnold Monto, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. \"We're moving away from a one-size-fits-all flu vaccine.\"\n\nCanada and the United Kingdom already express a preference for nasal spray vaccines for children.\n\nA person's immune system changes as they age, says Robert Belshe, director of the vaccine center at St. Louis University.\n\nIn a study of children published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Belshe found kids who got FluMist were half as likely to get influenza than those given an injection.\n\nFluMist offered broader protection than the shot, even when the strain of flu virus in circulation wasn't a good match to the strain used in the vaccine, his study found.\n\nIn that study, about 5% of children vaccinated with FluMist came down with influenza, compared with 10% of those given an injection.\n\nNot all kids can get FluMist, Belshe says. While injectable vaccines are currently approved for those over 6 months old, FluMist isn't recommended for kids with asthma or babies under age 2, because of a slightly increased risk of wheezing.\n\nYoung children seem to respond better than older kids and adults to FluMist, which uses a live, but weakened virus that can't cause influenza, Belshe says.\n\nFluMist doesn't cause the flu, however, because the viruses are specially engineered to grow only at the relatively cool temperatures of the nose. The viruses in FluMist can't reproduce in the lungs, which are a degree or two warmer, says Chris Ambrose, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at MedImmune, which makes FluMist.\n\nSince young kids haven't had much exposure to the flu, their immune systems respond vigorously to live viruses, Belshe says. The CDC says FluMist can reduce flu infections by up to 92%.\n\nYoung adults ages 18 to 49 seem to respond better to the injection, which contains a dead virus that also can't cause influenza, Monto says.\n\nAdults over 65 have weaker immune systems and don't respond well to any flu vaccine, even though they are among the most vulnerable to complications of influenza, Belshe says.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a new, high-dose flu shot for seniors that seems a bit better at stimulating the immune system. But definitive studies to show if the vaccine substantially reduces flu infections are still ongoing, Belshe says.\n\nWhile tailoring flu recommendations by age and vaccine type may make sense scientifically, Monto notes there could be practical problems in putting such detailed advice into place.\n\nDoctors may find it more cumbersome to stock several kinds of flu vaccines, Monto says.\n\nSome doctors, nurses and pharmacists are misinformed about FluMist's safety, says Rachel Vreeman, co-author of Don't Swallow Your Gum!: Myths, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies About Your Body and Health.\n\nSome doctors and pharmacists refuse to stock FluMist, and even caution patients against it, Vreeman says.\n\n\"The concerns over FluMist fall in the category of medical myths that even doctors believe,\" Vreeman says.\n\nStaying up to date on vaccine safety \"requires people to pay attention, and a lot of them don't, because they're busy with everything else.\"\n\nFluMist has been tested in more than 160,000 people says, Ambrose says.\n\nIn order for the viruses in FluMist to actually cause the flu, they would have to undergo four different genetic mutations, according to Poland's 2008 paper in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.\n\nThe most common side effects of FluMist are an increased risk of sniffles or congestion, caused by the virus reproducing in the nose, Poland writes. That reproduction helps to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against the virus.\n\nAnd while kids who sneeze out the FluMist viruses could theoretically infect others around them, this has only been documented once, Poland writes. Even then, the infected person didn't get the flu.\n\nRelatively few pharmacies, whose vaccine clinics tend to focus on older adults, stock FluMist. In a statement, Walgreens said the number of Walgreens customers who request FluMist is \"a very small, single-digit percentage.\"\n\nRecent studies showing its effectiveness, however, have won over many pediatricians, Ambrose says. About 90% of pediatricians now offer it. Among vaccinated children ages 2 to 17, about 40% receive FluMist.\n\nIn considering whether to steer patients toward FluMist, the CDC will consider not just its safety and effectiveness, but costs, whether MedImmune could produce an adequate supply and whether it's practical to make the change, says pediatrician Joseph Bocchini of Shreveport, La., a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nExperts will have to consider new issues, as well, including improvements to existing vaccines, Bocchini says. FluMist will be available next year in a form that protects against four viral strains, instead of the standard three. Bocchini expects that flu shots may also include four viral strains next year, as well.\n\nThe committee hasn't yet scheduled a vote on the issue, Bocchini says, and likely won't make a decision for several months.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/03/heart-disease-stroke-deaths-avoided/2755663/", "title": "Many deaths from heart disease, stroke could be avoided", "text": "Nanci Hellmich\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAbout 800%2C000 people die each year from cardiovascular disease\n\nAbout 200%2C000 of the deaths a year from heart disease%2C stroke could be avoided\n\nMany people need to make healthy changes including exercising%2C not smoking\n\nAbout 800,000 people die each year from cardiovascular disease. But as many as 200,000 of the deaths from heart disease and stroke could be prevented if people made healthy changes including stopping smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, doing more physical activity, eating less salt and managing their high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, says a government report out today.\n\nAlthough the rate of death (deaths per 100,000 people) from cardiovascular disease declined by 29% between 2001 and 2010, it's still the leading cause of death in the USA, says the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It accounts for one in three deaths in this country.\n\n\"These findings are really striking because we are talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that don't have to happen when they happen,\" says Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC.\n\nFor the latest analysis, CDC researchers looked at National Vital Statistics System mortality data from the period 2001-2010.\n\nPreventable/avoidable deaths were defined as all deaths from heart disease and stroke in people under age 75 because if their risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity) had been under control they should have lived longer, says the lead author Linda Schieb, a CDC epidemiologist. The current life expectancy in the USA is age 78 so if people died sooner than that it is considered early or premature, she says.\n\n• About 56% of preventable deaths from cardiovascular disease (112,000 deaths) in 2010 occurred in people under 65 years old. That number remained about the same between 2001 and 2010.\n\n• The number of preventable deaths from heart disease and stroke decreased by 25% between 2001 and 2010 for people ages 65 to 74.\n\n• Still, the highest overall death rate from cardiovascular disease was in the 65-74 age group with 401.5 deaths from cardiovascular disease per 100,000 people.\n\n• Men have the highest risk of death from heart disease and stroke across all races and ethnic groups. Black men are most at risk.\n\n• Blacks are nearly twice as likely as whites to die early from heart disease and stroke.\n\n• Compared with whites, blacks have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, low consumption of fruit and vegetables and poor control of bad (LDL) cholesterol.\n\n• Rates of preventable death from heart disease and stroke are highest in the South.\n\nIt's unfortunate that your longevity may be influenced more by your \"ZIP code\" than \"genetic code,\" Frieden says.\n\nHe says preventable death rates may decrease when more people have health coverage and access to screening and treatment through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"This report shows we're making some improvements, but we're not making enough improvements especially for people at high risk such as black men and women,\" says preventive cardiologist Gina Lundberg, an assistant professor of medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\n\"Americans need to take better control of their health and be more aggressive in controlling their blood pressure, their cholesterol, their weight, their exercise habits — and to stop smoking,\" she says.\n\nCardiologist Mariell Jessup, president of the American Heart Association, says the biggest barriers to success in changing this trend are projected increases in obesity and type 2 diabetes, and only modest improvements in diet and physical activity. \"Despite progress in smoking, high cholesterol and high blood pressure rates, obesity and diabetes are on the rise and must be addressed for heart disease and stroke deaths to drop 20% by 2020, a major American Heart Association goal.\"\n\nThe CDC recommends:\n\n• People have a conversation with a health care provider about the ABCS (aspirin when appropriate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management and smoking cessation) of heart health to help control blood pressure and high cholesterol, including taking medications as directed.\n\n• If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke get help to quit.\n\n• Try going for a brisk 10-minute walk, three times a day, five days a week.\n\n• Eat a heart-healthy diet, high in fruits and vegetables and low in sodium and trans fats.\n\n• Work to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n• Know the signs and symptoms of heart attack and stroke and get help as needed.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach. It may include shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort. Other signs may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.\n\nThe heart association says that signs of a stroke include face drooping, arm weakness or numbness and speech difficulty.\n\nFor more information, go to heart.org/warningsigns.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/03"}]}

Four points from this window gives the U.S. a promising chance to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nDest, the USMNT's starting right back, suffered a hamstring injury Thursday, while playing for Barcelona in the UEFA Europa League. Barcelona confirmed Friday Dest will be out indefinitely. The USMNT later announced left back George Bello will replace Dest.\n\nNineteen players returned for the USMNT's 28-man roster from its qualifiers in January and February. Given the high stakes this round, one of the nine fresh faces expected was veteran center back John Brooks. The 29-year-old has 45 appearances to his name, the third-most on the current roster, behind DeAndre Yedlin (71) and Kellyn Acosta (48).\n\n\"John Brooks – I had a good conversation with him and explained to him that this is our thinking for the window. This is what we chose to do this window,\" Berhalter said. \"It doesn't determine his future with the national team. And I think that's a very important distinction.\"\n\nHere are five takeaways from the USMNT's final 20202 World Cup Qualifying roster.\n\nBerhalter: Brooks not best fit right now\n\nBrooks' last call-up to the USMNT was during its first qualifying window in September, when he failed to impress in starts against Canada and Honduras. He was yanked at halftime in the latter match. What followed were an October injury and a poor spell with German club Wolfsburg.\n\nAfter being benched twice in December, Brooks has started 10 straight league matches for Wolfsburg. More important than any statistic, Brooks' grit and mental toughness is a valuable trait for the U.S. at Mexico and Costa Rica. Berhalter didn't see that as warranting a spot.\n\n\"There's some details in his game that I talked to him about that we need to improve to fit into our game,\" Berhalter said. \"And we don't have time on Tuesday to improve these things. The game's on Thursday, the (next) game's on Sunday. There's not a runway here.\n\n\"When this whole thing settles down – and hopefully we're in the World Cup and we have the June window, the September window – I think there'll be another opportunity for him, where we can really start addressing where we think his deficiencies are, to be the starting center back in our pool,\" said Berhalter.\n\nDest injury amplifies depth questions\n\nSince the November World Cup Qualifying window, Antonee Robinson has been the lone left back on the U.S. roster. Bello's addition provides cover, but the last-minute change raises a general question about the USMNT.\n\nNo McKennie means conventional defensive midfielders Acosta and Tyler Adams could start, with Yunus Musah as the one central midfielder connecting with the attack. But off the bench, Gianluca Busio and Luca de la Torre have a combined 14 appearances. Central midfielder Cristian Roldan has not started in World Cup Qualifying.\n\nIt's not that the U.S. lacks the talent or the bodies, but it will have to get creative in order to remain competitive and balanced in its most important matches under Berhalter thus far.\n\n\"Regarding Weston, you don't replace him,\" Berhalter said. \"We're not going to plug a guy in and get a like-for-like, but that's okay. We've won games before without him and we'll do it again.\"\n\nThe return of Reyna\n\nIt's no secret the 19-year-old Reyna is a difference-maker. He is the USMNT's one true central attacking midfielder – its designated chance creator. But following hamstring and thigh injuries keeping him from Borussia Dortmund and USMNT duties, Reyna hasn't played more than 30 minutes.\n\nBerhalter said he spoke to Dortmund manager Marco Rose Thursday, regarding his workload and said the U.S. will \"adjust accordingly,\" given that Reyna is still regaining his rhythm, fitness and game time.\n\nPepi a concern, Pefok returns to USMNT\n\nRicardo Pepi has started six of the USMNT's World Cup Qualifiers. Exacerbated by a move from FC Dallas to FC Augsburg in Germany this winter, the center forward hasn't scored since October.\n\n\"Am I concerned about Ricardo Pepi? Absolutely no question about it,\" Berhalter said. \"We want him scoring goals. We want all of our strikers scoring goals. He's a goal-scorer. That's comes naturally to him. And that's something we need him to refocus on – clear his mind, focus on doing the small things, getting in good positions, because if he gets in good positions, we're comfortable he's going to score.\"\n\nIt's likely the spotlight will be on Jordon Pefok to continue what he's done for BSC Young Boys in Switzerland, scoring six goals in his last seven matches. But Pepi will get his share, as it is likely he or Jesús Ferreira will start at least one of the three qualifiers.\n\nRotation: who will play, when?\n\nMexico's Estadio Azteca sits at more than 7,200 feet above sea level.\n\nBerhalter said \"it's certainly possible\" that some U.S. players could play a full 90 minutes in Mexico and then play the majority of the match against Panama.\n\nPlayers like Red Bull Salzburg winger Brenden Aaronson, who've played consistently twice a week, are possible examples. Not so much for Reyna, Pepi or MLS players who are currently used to one match per week. Berhalter admitted to rotation during this window.\n\nThe question going into Mexico City is, who?\n\nFor stories about Nashville SC or Soccer in Tennessee, contact Drake Hills at DHills@gannett.com.

That includes battles at key positions, and most notably at the center forward and goalkeeping spots.\n\nThe coming weeks could see players step forward in those position battles. Otherwise, the competitions will remain wide open with only one, two-match September international window remaining before the World Cup starts Nov. 21.\n\nTwo other subjects regarding the roster – the availability of Manchester City FC goalkeeper Zack Steffen and that of CF Montreal midfielder Djordje Mihailovic – were also early topics of discussion in the camp.\n\nSteffen withdrew from the camp for family reasons and was replaced on the roster by New York City FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson.\n\nBerhalter told The Enquirer that he didn't expect that development to hinder his decision-making process at the goalkeeping position.\n\nMihailovic came off the pitch during Saturday's match against FC Cincinnati unexpectedly early after an apparent fourth-minute injury following a clean tackle against Cincinnati's Junior Moreno.\n\nMihailovic was visibly emotional coming off the field, and understandably so as his injury came just ahead of his trip to Berhalter's camp after a years-long absence from the senior national team setup. On Monday, Berhalter announced that Mihailovic was forced to withdraw from USMNT camp with an ankle injury.\n\nMihailovic has six USMNT appearances, but hasn't played for the team since a December 2020 friendly against El Salvador.\n\nAs an early season frontrunner for Major League Soccer MVP honors, it was thought Mihailovic could use a strong June camp to potentially play his way into the World Cup.

Still, this is a must-win game for both sides, who might have to fend off their biggest rival without their respective star players.

On Saturday night, SKC hosts the surprising Colorado Rapids in a showdown of the second- and third-place teams in the Western Conference. This is the third time those two teams have met, and Sallói scored twice in a 3-1 win the last time SKC hosted the Rapids.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n49: The New England Revolution are leading the race toward the Supporters' Shield with 49 points, seven more than the next-nearest contender, the Seattle Sounders. Through 22 games, the Revolution are averaging 2.23 points per game, a pace that - if they can keep it up for the remaining 12 games - would eclipse Los Angeles FC's record of 72 points from 2019 (2.11 points per game).\n\nMORE:New England leads MLS going into final two months\n\nMLS news and notes\n\nUSMNT names roster for upcoming World Cup qualifiers: On Thursday, U.S. men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter named his 26-player roster for next month's qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

As part of the move, Buchanan will remain with the Revs through the end of the current season, which looks promising as New England is running circles around its Eastern Conference rivals and has a formidable lead in the race for the Supporters' Shield. Buchanan has six goals and four assists for his club so far in 2021.

Salzburg won the playoff by an aggregate score line of 4-2 and will be drawn in the Champions League group stage.\n\nMLS rankings: Top 10 power poll\n\n1. New England Revolution: New England entered all-star week with 49 points through 22 matches, seven more than any other team in Major League Soccer. The Revolution hold a plus-18 goal differential, tied with Seattle for tops in MLS. New England is on a four-game winning streak and six-match unbeaten streak heading into a showdown with NYCFC on Saturday night.\n\n2. Seattle Sounders: Seattle waivered in the summer months as the roster took a hit due to injuries, suspension and a few international call-ups. The Sounders righted the ship in August, winning their last three games and remaining unbeaten in their last four. Raúl Ruidíaz leads the league with 14 goals, but it is the team's league-low 17 goals allowed that is the real catalyst.\n\n3. Sporting Kansas City: Sporting is on a season-high five-match unbeaten streak which was continued last weekend in a scoreless draw against Minnesota United despite playing with 10 men for more than 70 minutes. Kansas City hasn’t lost in the month of August and avenged a July 31 defeat to FC Dallas in a 2-0 victory during the rematch on Aug. 14.\n\n4. Orlando City SC: Nani’s exploits, specifically his nine goals in 16 matches, had Orlando flying into the all-star break. No other player on the team has scored more than four goals, and only two players on the roster account for more than two. Orlando City picked up six points in four MLS matches so far in August. The group hosts Miami to close out the month on Friday.\n\n5. Colorado Rapids: The Rapids rarely get the attention the group deserves because it lacks star players. The Rapids’ 37 points, in only 19 matches, and plus-10 goal differential are both third best in the Western Conference. Their 19 goals allowed are second in the league. Leading scorer Michael Barrios sits on five goals.\n\n6. Philadelphia Union: Philadelphia entered the all-star break with 32 points and a plus-seven goal differential through 21 games. The Union rebounded from an Aug. 8 loss at New England with a victory over NYCFC and a 1-1 draw with CF Montreal. The Union travel to DC United on Saturday night.\n\n7. Los Angeles Galaxy: The Galaxy remain in the fourth spot of the Western Conference despite an extended absence from star attacker Chicharito, who began the season with 10 goals in 10 matches played. Despite 35 points from 21 games, the Galaxy’s goal differential is zero. That’s because of a leaky defense that’s allowed 32 goals.\n\n8. New York City FC: NYCFC sits in fourth place of the Eastern Conference with 31 points in 19 matches, which is tied for the fewest played in the conference. New York’s plus-15 goal differential is second-highest in the Eastern Conference, but a 1-0 loss to Philadelphia and a postponed match against the Red Bulls slowed momentum leading into the all-star break.\n\n9. Nashville SC: Nashville is the only team in the league with more than 30 points and fewer than eight wins. The 11 draws on the season are highest in MLS. Conversely, Nashville’s two losses are fewest in the league. The last win for Nashville came on July 24 at home against Cincinnati.\n\n10. CF Montreal: The best team north of the border plays in Montreal. The club is consistent, if nothing else, possessing seven wins, seven draws and seven losses to go along with a plus-one goal differential.

Ron DeSantis and Democrat Charlie Crist went toe-to-toe on abortion, Hurricane Ian response, the state’s ongoing culture wars and the rising Republican’s future political ambitions in an hour-long debate that produced a handful of notable moments that may just yet fire up Democrats in this state.\n\nDown in the polls and nearly out of campaign money, Crist entered the Sunrise Theatre in Fort Pierce, Florida, with almost nothing left to lose and he repeatedly put DeSantis on the defensive over the divisive agenda that has catapulted the Republican into GOP stardom.​ Crist’s objective Monday was twofold: build momentum for the final weeks of the Florida race and bruise the national reputation of DeSantis, who is also weighing a potential presidential primary campaign against former President Donald Trump as he seeks reelection as governor.\n\nIn the face of Crist’s broadsides, DeSantis largely stayed the course, visibly gritting his teeth at times or feigning a smile, while sticking to his talking points and delivering a series of well-timed lines. DeSantis appeared less at ease on the debate stage than at his hand-crafted news conferences orchestrated to showcase his signature combative style. It was a conventional performance of a front-runner – and with a comfortable lead and almost $100 million left in the bank, DeSantis is certainly that, albeit one who has risen up the GOP’s presidential power rankings by bucking conventional wisdom.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Monday’s first and only debate of Florida’s governor race.\n\nDeSantis won’t commit to full four-year term\n\nCrist entered the debate seeking to engineer a race-altering moment that could galvanize not just Florida Democrats but people around the country looking to slow DeSantis’ national rise.\n\nWith DeSantis and Crist often on opposing sides of a split screen and with a raucous crowd cheering over the objections of a debate moderator, the night produced plenty of opportunities for Crist to do just that.\n\nIn one such moment, Crist attempted to get DeSantis to commit to a full four-year term if he wins in November.\n\nDeSantis, considering a run for president in 2024, wouldn’t bite.\n\nThe exchange began with DeSantis comparing Crist’s policies to President Joe Biden. Crist responded by suggesting DeSantis was focused on Biden because he wants to face the President in 2024.\n\n“I have a question for you. You’re running for governor. Why don’t you look in the eyes of the people of the state of Florida and say to them if you’re reelected, you will serve a full four-year term as governor?” Crist said. “Yes or no?”\n\nDeSantis stared into the camera and didn’t respond, producing a prolonged silence.\n\nCrist then chimed in, “It’s not a tough question. It’s a fair question. He won’t tell you.”\n\nDebate moderator WPEC anchor Liz Quirantes informed the audience that the candidates did not agree to ask each other questions directly on stage.\n\nWhen Crist’s time expired, DeSantis finally responded.\n\n“I know that Charlie’s interested in talking about 2024, in Joe Biden,” DeSantis said. “But I just want to make things very, very clear. The only worn out old donkey I’m looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist.”\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis takes to the stage opposite his Democratic challenger at Monday's debate. Crystal Vander Welter/Pool/Reuters\n\nDeSantis ducks on abortion\n\nAfter the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, DeSantis in a statement said he would take steps to “protect life” in Florida, but he has declined in the months since to say what that action might be. When Quirantes asked DeSantis what week abortion access should be cut off in Florida, the governor said he was “proud” of the state’s 15-week ban that he signed into law earlier this year but didn’t say if he would support legislation to further restrict access in the state.\n\n“I just think we’re better when everybody counts,” DeSantis said. “I understand not everyone’s going to be born in perfect circumstances, but I would like to see everybody have a shot.”\n\nCrist criticized the response for not answering the question and said the state’s new 15-week ban was “callous” and barbaric.” The law includes exemptions for a fatal fetal abnormality if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing or when a pregnancy is a “serious risk” to the mother. It does not allow exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.\n\n“We just found out recently about a case of a middle school girl near Jacksonville, who was a victim of incest, became impregnated because of the bill you signed, governor,” Crist said. “She had to go two to three states in order to take care of this issue.”\n\nDeSantis accused Crist of only supporting abortion rights out of political expediency. He noted that when Crist was a Republican, he often considered himself on the other side of the abortion debate. Crist, a former GOP governor who left his party in 2010, once characterized himself as “pro-life.”\n\n“The question is, is this an honest change of heart? Or is this a guy that’s going to shift with whatever when he needs to to try to keep his political career alive?” DeSantis said. “I think we all know the answer to that question.”\n\nDeSantis defends his most controversial actions\n\nThough coy about abortion, DeSantis more willingly defended his other actions that have drawn frequent criticism and lawsuits from Democrats, migrant groups, LGBTQ groups and their allies, but that have also generated broad appeal to the GOP base in Florida and beyond.\n\nMore on DeSantis Head of DeSantis-backed election police force in Florida dies Florida lawmaker sues DeSantis to block future migrant flights from the border DeSantis makes appeal to GOP base with migrant move as he faces reelection and eyes 2024 Crist urges Democratic donors to help stop DeSantis before he becomes too powerful\n\nOn new state rules preventing certain transgender health care for minors, DeSantis likened “gender affirming care” to “chemically castrating young boys,” adding: “A lot of kids go through a lot of different things. A lot of the dysphoria resolves itself by the time they become adults.”\n\nOn the flights he orchestrated that took migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, he said, “It’s sad that it comes to this but what we did put this issue front and center.”\n\nOn banning critical race theory from the classroom, DeSantis said, “I don’t want to teach kids to hate our country. I don’t want to teach kids to hate each other and the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n\nIn a comment that seemed aimed at much of DeSantis’ defense on these topics, Crist said, “He talks about it like it’s fun. It’s not. These are difficult issues and they deserve mature leadership.”\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist speaks during his debate with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on October 24, 2022. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nThe hurricane test\n\nCrist and Biden have been in lockstep over the President’s agenda for much of their two years overlapping in Washington. But Crist made clear Monday he disagrees with Biden’s assessment of DeSantis’ storm management.\n\nAt a joint appearance earlier this month in Fort Myers Beach, where Hurricane Ian destroyed most beachfront property, Biden told reporters DeSantis’ response to the devastation was “pretty remarkable.” Crist, though, accused DeSantis of leaving people in harm’s way.\n\nCrist noted DeSantis attended a high school football game on the Friday before the storm made landfall and said he was “AWOL for almost 24 hours” when a decision could have been made to evacuate Lee County.\n\n“And as a result, 100 people lose their lives?” Crist said. “That’s not a good record. And that’s not good leadership.”\n\nDeSantis said Crist was trying to “politicize” the response.\n\n“Our message was listen to your locals, it’s ultimately a local decision,” DeSantis said. “I stand by every one of our local counties. They stood up, they worked hard and they made the best decisions with the information that they had.”\n\nPandemic pandemonium\n\nDeSantis became a political force through his management of the Covid-19 pandemic and it remains a frequent focal point of the stump speeches he delivers in Florida and beyond.\n\nIf Crist had been governor at the time, DeSantis said, “it would have thrown millions of Floridians into turmoil.”\n\n“And I can tell you as Charlie Crist and his friends in Congress were urging you to be locked down, I lifted you up,” DeSantis said. “I protected your rights. I made sure you could earn a living. I made sure you could operate your businesses and I worked like heck to make sure we had all our kids in school in person five days a week.”\n\nCrist attempted to challenge DeSantis’ perceived strength head on.\n\n“We have one of the highest death rates in America, Ron, and over 6 million of our fellow Floridians have gotten Covid under your leadership,” he said. “Now that’s not something to be boastful and proud of.”\n\nCrist also brought some dizzying logic to the debate when he called DeSantis “the only governor in the history of Florida” to shut down schools and businesses, a nod to the period early in the 2020 pandemic when the Sunshine State, like most of the country, followed pandemic mitigation measures encouraged by the Trump administration. Crist then said, “It’s important to listen to science, to do what’s right, to utilize common sense. You don’t just shut down at the outset.”\n\nBut those mitigation strategies, including social distancing and halting business activity, were recommended by scientists at the time. And Crist was one of 13 Florida Democrats in Congress who in a letter urged DeSantis to issue a stay-at-home order in March 2020 — weeks into the pandemic.\n\nDeSantis said he reopened schools against the objections of teacher unions, a key Crist ally.\n\n“We just got the Nation’s Report Card, the results from all 50 states,” DeSantis said. “Florida: number three in fourth grade reading and number four in the country in fourth grade math. … That would not have happened if we let Charlie Crist and his friends lock our kids out of school like they did in California and like they did in New York. We did it right in Florida.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/winners-losers-2022-midterm-elections/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Winners and losers from the 2022 election so far | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOh, what a night!\n\nThe 2022 election is now in the books, although vote counting continues in a lot of places with so many races still uncalled – and it was not what most political handicappers expected.\n\nDemocrats, who were expected to suffer considerable losses in the House, appear to have held their own, but they still look likely to wind up in the minority.\n\nThe battle for Senate control is a nip-and-tuck affair, with Democrats currently netting a single seat in Pennsylvania. Key races in Arizona and Nevada are too early to call, while CNN projects the Georgia Senate contest is headed toward a December 6 runoff.\n\nBelow I’ve picked out some of the biggest winners and losers from the midterm election results so far. As more results come in, I’ll keep updating who had good nights and who leaves disappointed.\n\nWINNERS\n\n* Ron DeSantis: In an overall disappointing night for Republicans, the Florida governor was a very bright spot. He absolutely crushed former Gov. Charlie Crist to win a second term. The victory – and the margin by which he won – could well serve as a springboard for DeSantis’ national hopes as it allows him to make the argument that he can do nationally what he just did in Florida. DeSantis reached for broad conclusions in the wake of his victory, calling it a “win for the ages” (I mean…) and casting Florida as the state “where woke goes to die.” (Alrighty.) DeSantis is now clearly a politician with momentum coming out of the election and now the Republican Party waits to see what he’ll do next.\n\n* Josh Shapiro: If you’re looking for the next generation of Democratic rock stars, look no further than Shapiro, who coasted to victory in the Pennsylvania governor’s race on Tuesday. Shapiro is articulate, bright and has a clearly demonstrated appeal among voters in a swing state. Shapiro’s win is also a victory for election security. The Pennsylvania governor appoints the head of elections for the state, and Shapiro’s opponent – Republican Doug Mastriano – was a 2020 election denier.\n\n* Marjorie Taylor Greene: Had Republicans realized the wave that so many of them were predicting in the run-up to the election, the party would be on their way to enjoying a comfortable cushion of seats in the majority. But that’s not what appears to be happening nationally. The most likely outcome – and there are still plenty of key races that are too early to call – appears to be a narrow Republican majority. That would be great news for Greene and her fellow members of the House Freedom Caucus. Since that group represents a solid bloc of votes, Greene and her ilk would be able to hold out their support from Republican leadership in order to extract concessions and gain leverage. Under that scenario, whichever Republican would become speaker – with Kevin McCarthy being the favorite – would have to make sure he is right with the Freedom Caucus before any major vote.\n\n* Simon Rosenberg: Rosenberg, a longtime Democratic strategist, was telling anyone who would listen that the seeming movement to Republicans in the final weeks of the race was misleading – fueled by a series of Republican-sponsored polls that moved polling averages in a more favorable direction for the GOP. He was right. Period.\n\n* Gretchen Whitmer: The Michigan governor had high highs and low lows during her first term. But on Tuesday, she won convincingly over Republican Tudor Dixon, leading by nearly 10 points as of Wednesday morning. Whitmer, who was on the list of potential Joe Biden vice presidential picks in 2020, has solidified her status as a force to be reckoned with in the future of the Democratic Party.\n\n* Sarah Huckabee Sanders: The former Trump White House press secretary cruised to a general election win to become the next governor of Arkansas. Which was expected. Watch now to see what Sanders does to expand her appeal beyond the state’s borders. She is absolutely someone who seems likely to wind up in the national candidate pool at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\n* Joe Manchin: No matter what happens in the remaining uncalled Senate races, we know this: the Senate majority is going to be razor-thin – again. Which means that Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat, is likely going to, again, be a swing vote on critical legislation over the next two years. Which, if the past two years is any indication, is a very powerful place to be. Adding another wrinkle? Manchin is up for reelection to a third term in 2024 …\n\nLOSERS\n\n* Donald Trump: It’s hard to imagine things going any worse for the former president on Tuesday night. Republicans did not sweep the country in his oft-predicted Republican wave and the rise of DeSantis was one of the big storylines coming out of Election Day. (Not to mention the fact that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, two Republicans who have drawn Trump’s ire, won reelection.) And you can tell that Trump is getting nervous about DeSantis, sending him a warning shot over the 2024 presidential race on Tuesday. I don’t think anything – including last night’s results – will change Trump’s trajectory in 2024. But despite all his bluster (and there will be plenty of it), it’s clear that Tuesday was not the night Trump hoped it would be.\n\n* Beto O’Rourke: O’Rourke came up short in his challenge to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday night, meaning that he has now lost three straight elections: 1) The 2018 Senate race to Ted Cruz; 2) the 2020 Democratic presidential primary; 3) the 2022 governor’s race. In politics, like in baseball, it’s usually three strikes and you’re out. It’s hard to see O’Rourke credibly running for another office any time soon – a remarkable downturn for someone who was regarded as a rising Democratic star just a few years ago.\n\n* Stacey Abrams: Speaking of stars who have faded, the Georgia Democrat lost the governor’s race in convincing fashion as she was unable to replicate the coalition that got her close to victory four years ago. Abrams, who emerged from that first race as all the rage among Democrats nationally, looks far less impressive this time around. And with two losses in her two most recent races, it’s hard to see where a political comeback starts for her.\n\n* Charlie Crist: It’s hard to imagine Democrats aren’t ruing their decision to nominate the former Republican governor as their party’s nominee against DeSantis. Crist, who lost the governorship to Rick Scott in 2014, never had a chance against DeSantis and put up almost zero resistance throughout the campaign. This looks like the end of the line for Crist in Florida politics.\n\n* Kevin McCarthy: Yes, it’s a bit odd to have the man who could be in line to be the next speaker of the House in the loser category. But consider the predicament that McCarthy would face if Republicans win control of the House and he is picked to lead the party: A potentially narrow majority controlled – or at least heavily influenced – by the most extreme elements within his party. (See Marjorie Taylor Greene above.) Those forces would maintain significant leverage over every vote that McCarthy would try to take. Getting anything done – much less doing the things that the House Freedom Caucus might push for, like impeaching Biden – would be a heavy lift.\n\n* Republican Senate map expansion: In the final stretch of the campaign, some Senate Republican strategists suggested that they could well put three reach states – New Hampshire, Colorado and Washington – into play, giving themselves more paths to the majority. None of the three races wound up being all that close. The Democratic incumbents all not only won, but as Wednesday morning, were leading by double digits.\n\n* Election deniers: Several high-profile election deniers running for governor across the country came out on the losing end. In Wisconsin, Tim Michels lost. In Michigan, Dixon fell short. Mastriano got blown out in Pennsylvania. Ditto Dan Cox in Maryland. And Darren Bailey in Illinois. While CNN hasn’t called the Arizona governor’s race, Republican Kari Lake is trailing.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/desantis-gop-base-migrants-massachusetts/index.html", "title": "DeSantis makes appeal to GOP base with migrant move as he faces ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBy arranging to fly two planes of migrants onto the tony island of Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis has thrust Florida into an escalating battle between red state leaders and the Biden administration over the US-Mexico border and once again put himself at the forefront of a political cause that is animating Republican voters two months before the midterm elections.\n\nFor months, DeSantis has been plotting out loud his plans to get Florida involved in redirecting migrants from the border in a way that would maximize heartburn for Democratic leaders. His administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to President Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware, among other liberal strongholds.\n\nWhen he laid out his immigration agenda at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha’s Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, “It’s somewhat tongue-in-cheek but it is true, if you sent to Delaware or Martha’s Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.” And last month, DeSantis telegraphed that Florida’s involvement in moving migrants might start at the southern border, not with people who had arrived in his state.\n\n“We do have money to be able to do (that), but that’s from people from the southern border, that’s not going in the interior of Florida,” DeSantis said at an August press conference.\n\nStill, as the maneuver played out in real time – with jarring images of an estimated 50 people, some who fled a brutal South American dictatorship, wandering an unfamiliar Northeastern vacation spot unprepared for their arrival – it sent shockwaves through Florida and Massachusetts and rattled those left to deal with the fallout. And it served to put the country on notice that the reach of DeSantis, a hard-charging Republican leader who is weighing a campaign for president in 2024, already extends well beyond his state’s boundaries.\n\n“All those people in DC, and New York were beating their chests when (Donald) Trump was president, saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions saying how bad it was to have a secure border,” DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday morning. “The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk.”\n\n“It just shows you…their virtue signaling is a fraud,” said DeSantis, who’s running for a second term in November.\n\nIn Massachusetts, where local officials scrambled to find accommodations for the migrants, Democratic leaders accused the Republican governor of orchestrating a political stunt with human lives.\n\n“Think about the governor of Florida, one of the largest states in the nation, spending his time hatching a secret plot to ship up 50 immigrants here, families, some of them children as young as four, and use them as political pawns just so he can get on Tucker Carlson and beat his chest about how he’s tough on immigration,” Massachusetts state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, a Democrat, said Thursday morning on CNN.\n\n“He is a coward, and the real story is the island community that has rallied to come together and support these people – they represent the best of what America has to offer.”\n\nIn Florida, the Democratic Party Chairman Manny Diaz called it “a new low” for the Florida governor. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist said, “Everything Ron DeSantis does is to score political points with his hard right base in a thinly veiled attempt to run for President – but it’s Floridians who pay the price.”\n\nThis is not the first time DeSantis has waded into the country’s divisive immigration debate in a way that has maximized exposure for the Republican governor while costing taxpayers. In June of last year, DeSantis sent law enforcement to the southern border, insisting he had “answered the call” for help from Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona. A month later, DeSantis visited the border to hold a news conference with Abbott, and he paired it with a fundraising pitch to his supporters.\n\nThose actions earned DeSantis considerable praise from conservative commentators and didn’t noticably hurt his political standing in his state, where one in five residents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino. It remains to be seen if immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities will respond more negatively to DeSantis sending migrants, who were legally processed at the border, 2,000 miles to Massachusetts.\n\nMany of those on the planes to Martha’s Vineyard said their country of origin was Venezuela, where millions of people are fleeing the oppressive regime of Nicolás Maduro. More than half the Venezuelans in the country are in Florida, according to a 2020 Migration Policy Institute report, with 109,000 just in the Miami metropolitan area. Political observers in Florida have noted the Venezuelan community’s growing political clout in a state that is often won on the margins.\n\n“We are here today to tell the Governor that no Hispanic, no immigrant, but in this case we, Venezuelans, are not pieces on his political boardgame to get headlines and to get political points in his quest to become the Republican nominee for the 2024 Presidential Election,” said Adelys Ferro, director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, at a news conference Thursday in South Florida.\n\nIt is not clear if DeSantis and Abbott are coordinating efforts at the border, or competing. Abbot has bussed thousands of migrants to Democratic cities in recent weeks. The morning after the two planes landed in Martha’s Vineyard, buses from Texas dropped off migrants outside the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, where Vice President Kamala Harris resides.\n\nLike DeSantis, Abbott is running for reelection this year and is also a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Earlier this summer, DeSantis was critical of Texas’ response to the surge of migrants at the border, suggesting the Lone Star State shouldn’t be letting them cross over to the US in the first place.\n\n“What they need to do, Texas, should just send them back across the border,” DeSantis said in June. “You know, who cares what the feds are saying they’re not doing their job. Or not let them come across the border to begin with because they go right across the river. They just walk right across. No one’s stopping. So you know, some pushback I think would be good.”\n\nDeSantis has also been recruiting more Republicans to join his hardline approach to border migration. In a widely followed speech in Arizona last month where he campaigned for Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor there, DeSantis hinted at more collaboration to come if she is elected.\n\n“What I’ve told Kari Lake, I said, ‘Look, if you’re willing to put people on that border and keep them from coming in to begin with, I’ll send National Guard to help with that,” DeSantis said.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterm-election-live-updates/8257821001/", "title": "Midterm election results 2022: Recap on Election Day", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Election Day 2022.

Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep.

Tony Evers won a heated re-election battle against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll last week had them tied at 48%.\n\nEvers won the governor’s office by a thin margin in 2018 when he defeated Republican Scott Walker, a 2016 presidential candidate. Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates:Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race.

Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nIt’s also a bellwether for which way national tides are turning on Election Day. The Senate seat has been occupied since 2011 by Republican Sen.

Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep.

But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959.

She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September.

Ted Cruz in 2018 and made a brief presidential run in 2020. O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.

And he pushed GOP get-out-the-vote efforts and campaigned before large, supportive crowds in a final week dash around the state knowing that a blowout win would give him the bounce he needs to maybe launch a presidential campaign.

O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L. Hughley Show” when asked about his message to Black Americans who are still on the fence about voting.\n\nMAGA Republicans are “a different breed of cat,” Biden said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday morning. “They care about your community about as much as … well, anyway,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “You’ve seen what you’ve got from that community,” he added.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race: Ted Budd supporters optimistic at polls\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – North Carolina has never elected a woman of color to the U.S. Senate, and many voters don't expect that to change Tuesday.\n\nSupporters of Democrat Cheri Beasley say they are not exactly confident, but some remain hopeful: \"Some of the underdogs come out on top!\" said Jannet Blue, 58, a Department of Motor Vehicles supervisor who voted in Winston-Salem.\n\nBackers of Republican Ted Budd are more confident; his poll lead has grown in recent weeks, and voters said it just feels like a Republican year in the Tar Heel State. \"We need to keep working people working,\" said James Wilcox, 61, a Winston-Salem businessman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nArizona voting machines: Maricopa County resolves ballot tabulation issues at some locations\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department found a solution for tabulation issues that affected about 60 of the county’s 223 voting centers, the county government said Tuesday.\n\nPrinters at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on ballots, according to Maricopa County’s official Twitter. To resolve the issue, county technicians changed the printer settings. The solution has so far worked at 17 locations and technicians have been deployed to the remaining locations to resolve the issue, according to the county.\n\nStephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, issued an apology to voters on his personal Twitter, promising that “every legal vote will be tabulated.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nPhiladelphia voting ‘going great’ so far\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tuesday has been a “wonderful” day for voting in the city, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\n“It’s going great,” he told USA TODAY. “Nothing has risen to a level of concern.”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of voters have been able to cast ballots without incident and the processing has been “going smoothly,” Custodio said.\n\nPolls are open until 8 p.m. and voters can turn in mailed ballots until that time in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFor some in New Hampshire, Biden’s stake in democracy gets through\n\nBEDFORD, N.H. – For some in New Hampshire, where presidential candidates flock every four years, President Joe Biden’s message that democracy is at stake resonated with some voters.\n\nJonathan French says it’s why he’s voting for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power.

Voters and children playing in the area were escorted into the voting room, he said, and the doors were shut.\n\nLibrary staff declined to comment on the incident. Police would not confirm whether a knife was involved, saying only that someone was taken into custody following a disturbance in which no one was injured. Voting at the library was disrupted for about 30 minutes, the poll worker said, but has since returned to normal operations.\n\n– Lawrence Andrea\n\nGet your 2022 live midterm election results here\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are underway and American voters are hitting the polls to elect members of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as governors in certain states.\n\nFollow our live coverage for Senate results, House results and gubernatorial results begin to roll in. You can also learn how to vote and who's on the ballot in your state.\n\nCybersecurity officials: Still no specific or credible threat to disrupt election operations\n\nTwo senior U.S. cybersecurity officials said Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Homeland Security continues to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure or election day operations, and that it remains vigilant to protect against foreign nation disinformation and malign influence operations.\n\nThe officials, both with DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA, noted that there have been a few isolated issues arising from within the 8,800 or so individual election jurisdictions in the United States, including Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\nBut they described them as nothing out of the ordinary and said CISA was in close touch with elected officials there and elsewhere across the country in order to understand and respond to any election day problems if needed.The officials, both speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing cybersecurity operations, referred questions about Maricopa County to local officials there, who have released statements and a video explaining how the voting machinery works.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nVoting rights group: Overvoting in NH causes some concerns\n\nDERRY, N.H. – In New Hampshire, some voters are filling out more names than they should on their ballot, forcing their ballot to be hand recounted rather than being read by a machine. Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife. Most recently, allegations surfaced that he pressured former girlfriends to have abortions, which he has denied.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMark Kelly, Blake Masters set for final pitch in Arizona Senate race\n\nOn one side is Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 1.5% as of 1 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also up by more than 1%.\n\nStocks tend to perform better when in a divided Congress gridlock since it can restrict government spending and hold up new legislation that can negatively impact stocks, analysts said.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald and Medora Lee\n\nMore debates is what some voters wanted\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. — Coming out of his polling place in DeKalb County, voter Gregory Ewing said what was most aggravating during the 2022 midterms was the lack of debates.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported in September many candidates sought to avoid each other in some of the most high-profile races.\n\nEwing said Georgians deserved more chances to see a direct contrast between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker on stage in the final weeks of the race.\n\n“It’s hard to know what the truth is with these ads. The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov. Greg Abbott faces Beto O’Rourke\n\nTexans have their eye on the marquee race for governor: incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott runs against Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke caught the attention of the state and nation after running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. Abbott is fighting for a third term.\n\nAbbott has led ahead of O’Rourke in Texas polls; margins sometimes reach single digits. On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation. O’Rourke’s final ad ahead of Election Day centered around his support for abortion access.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\nBiden spending Election Day at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is spending Election Day at the White House with no public events on his schedule.\n\nThe White House said he dropped in on a virtual phone bank by the Democratic National Committee to thank staff and volunteers and taped a radio interview targeted at Black Americans.\n\nThe president has already cast his midterm ballot. Accompanied by one of his granddaughters, a first-time voter, Biden voted in Wilmington, Delaware, on Oct. 29.\n\nBiden is expected to address the nation about the election results on Wednesday, though they are likely to be incomplete at that point.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump says he voted for DeSantis, hints again at presidential run\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he voted Tuesday morning for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, while also dropping more hints that he’ll soon declare a third run for the White House, according to media reports.\n\nTrump spoke to the media after he cast his vote at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on Tuesday morning, according to video posted by the local CBS news station CBS12. Former first lady Melania Trump joined him. \"No matter who you vote for, you have to vote,\" Trump told a sparse crowd outside the polling station.\n\nTrump also repeated that he’ll be making an announcement a week from today at his Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, though he didn't say about what. \"I think Tuesday will be a very exciting day for a lot of people,” Trump said, adding that, “The country has gotten very bad.

That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS:Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen.

He said he supported Republican candidates in the election.\n\n“This country is going to hell if we don’t change it. We’ve got too many people who hate it,\" he said. “We should control the government but we’ve lost it.”\n\nBut Jonathan Copeland, 55, said he worries that Republican control of the House and Senate would mean further erosion of abortion rights, which he supports. Copeland said he voted to help defend the seat of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat in danger of losing to Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.

Ron DeSantis signs bill creating new Florida election police ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a sweeping voting overhaul bill that establishes a new election police force – giving his administration a new way to probe election crimes.\n\nWith the GOP governor’s signature, Florida has become one of the first states in the country with a unit focused on election fraud, an exceedingly rare problem that has become an animating issue for some Republican voters following former President Donald Trump’s 2020 loss.\n\n“I don’t think there is any other place in the country where you should have more confidence that your vote counts than in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said at a news conference before signing the law.\n\nDeSantis, who is up for reelection this year and is weighing a 2024 presidential bid, signed the bill as he works to burnish his credentials with the ultra-conservative wing of his party. The bill-signing comes on the heels of DeSantis signing a series of other controversial measures last week, including two bills that target Disney and legislation that imposes restrictions on how schools and businesses can talk about race and gender.\n\nThe new law marks the second major overhaul of Florida’s election laws since the 2020 election – as supporters of Trump clamor for more voting restrictions and changes to election administration ahead of midterm elections. Trump and his allies falsely maintain that widespread election fraud led to his 2020 defeat.\n\nTrump won the Sunshine State by a comfortable margin that year, and Florida officials, including DeSantis, previously have said the 2020 election went smoothly.\n\nElection fraud is exceedingly rare. The Florida Secretary of State’s office says it received 262 election fraud complaints about the 2020 election and referred 75 to law enforcement or prosecutors. Nearly 11 million Floridians cast ballots in the presidential contest that year.\n\nThe new law creates an Office of Election Crimes and Security within the Florida Department of State – an agency under DeSantis’ jurisdiction – with a staff of 15 to conduct preliminary investigations of election fraud. In addition, the measure calls for DeSantis to appoint up to 10 law enforcement officers to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate election crimes.\n\nDuring Monday’s news conference, DeSantis said local election supervisors and prosecutors don’t necessarily have the expertise and tools to investigate voting-related complaints. The new officers would specialize in election-related crimes, he said.\n\n“We just want to make sure whatever laws are on the books that those laws are enforced,” the governor added.\n\nThe combined program will cost $3.7 million, state Rep. Daniel Perez, a top sponsor, said during legislative debate. DeSantis initially sought nearly $6 million for a 52-member force.\n\nTwo states – Florida and neighboring Georgia – have moved in recent weeks to beef up policing of election crimes.\n\nThe new Florida law also increases penalties for violating Florida election laws. It makes it a felony to collect and submit more than two vote-by-mail ballots on behalf of other voters. It previously was a misdemeanor to do so. It also increases the fine from $1,000 to $50,000 on organizations that violate voter registration laws.\n\nCecile Scoon, the president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, called the new $50,000 fine a “direct threat” to her organization.\n\n“When you couple the increased fines with the new election investigators, it doesn’t give you a warm or cozy feeling,” she told CNN in March as state lawmakers debated the measure.\n\nThe new law also extends an existing ban on private donations to include “the cost of any litigation related to election administration.” Critics say that will cut off free legal assistance to election officials, who could face additional scrutiny under the new law.\n\nAdditionally, it also requires election supervisors to clean voter rolls annually rather than every two years and imposes a $1,000 fine for switching voters’ party registration without their consent. That provision responds to recent reports in South Florida that some older voters had their party affiliation changed from Democrat to Republican without their knowledge.\n\nDeSantis’ action follows a March 31 court ruling that found several aspects of an earlier Florida election law passed in 2021 were unconstitutional and improperly targeted Black voters. In that ruling, federal Judge Mark Walker also barred the state from making any future election rule changes that are similar to the provisions he struck down, unless the changes are first submitted to the US Department of Justice or the courts for approval or “pre-clearance.”\n\nIn a filing this week with the court, Florida officials said they disagreed with Walker’s pre-clearance requirement but would forgo enforcing several sections of the law DeSantis signed Monday until they receive further guidance. Those provisions include changes that affect third-party voter registration groups and the use of ballot drop boxes.\n\nFlorida officials already have filed notice that they intend to appeal Walker’s decision to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. And election law experts say Walker’s ruling is likely to be overturned by either the conservative-leaning 11th Circuit or the US Supreme Court.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/opinions/outcome-us-2022-midterm-election-roundup/index.html", "title": "Opinion: A really bad night for some high-profile Trump-backed ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCNN Opinion contributors share their thoughts on the outcome of the 2022 midterm elections. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nScott Jennings: DeSantis shows he can do what Trump can’t\n\nScott Jennings courtesy of Scott Jennings\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent a clear message to every Republican voter Tuesday night: My way is the path to a national majority, and former President Donald Trump’s way is the path to future disappointments and continued suffering.\n\nFour years ago, DeSantis won his first gubernatorial race by less than a percentage point. His nearly 20-point win against Democratic candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday sent the message that DeSantis, not Trump, can win over the independent voters who decide elections.\n\nDeSantis’ decisive victory offers a future where the Republican Party might actually win the popular vote in a presidential contest – something that hasn’t been done since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the candidates Trump endorsed in 2022 struggled, and it was clear from CNN exit polls that the former President – with his 37% favorability rating – would be a serious underdog in the 2024 general election should he win the Republican presidential nomination for a third time.\n\nMy friend Patrick Ruffini of Echelon Insights tweeted a key observation: DeSantis commanded huge support among Latinos in 2022 compared to Trump in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won the heavily Latino Miami-Dade County by seven points. DeSantis flipped the county on Tuesday and ran away with an 11-point win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Osceola County by nearly 14 points. This time, DeSantis secured the county by nearly seven points, marking a whopping 21-point swing.\n\nDeSantis combined his strength among Latinos with his support among working class Whites, suburban white-collar voters and rural Floridians. That’s a coalition that could win nationally, unlike Trump’s limited appeal among several traditional Republican voting segments.\n\nLast year, it was Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia who scored an earthquake in a Biden state by keeping Trump at arm’s length and focusing on the issues. Tonight, it was DeSantis who ran as his own man (Trump rallied for Marco Rubio but not DeSantis at the end of the campaign) and showed what you can do when you combine the political instincts required to be a successful Republican these days with actual governing competence.\n\nDeSantis made a convincing case that he, rather than Trump, gives Republicans the best chance to defeat Biden (or some other Democrat) in 2024. With Trump plotting a reelection campaign announcement soon, DeSantis has a lot to think about and a solid springboard from which to launch a challenge to the former President.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W.

If election night confirmed anything for me it is this: We can all – voters, doomscrollers, pundits and election deniers included – stop believing every election revolves around former President Donald Trump. Instead, when asked in exit polls across the country, younger people, women and other voters in key demographics said their top concerns were inflation, abortion rights, crime and other quality of life issues.\n\nWhat a relief. It finally feels like a majority of voters want to re-center American politics away from the toxic, conspiracy theory-driven rhetoric we’ve experienced over the past several years.\n\nYes, Republicans are still projected to take control of the House of Representatives, with a narrow (and narrowing) majority – but will that make much difference? Despite the advantage Democrats had in the chamber the past two years, President Joe Biden has still had to battle and compromise to get parts of his agenda passed. How the balance of power will settle in the Senate is unclear, with a few races in key states still undecided as of this afternoon. It will likely hinge, again, on Georgia, and a forthcoming runoff election between the incumbent, Democrat Raphael Warnock, and his GOP challenger, former football star Herschel Walker.\n\nNo matter what party you claim, there were positive signs coming out of the midterms. My hometown, Philadelphia, and its surrounding suburbs, came up big in another election – rejecting the Trump-backed New Jersey transplant, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and helping to send Democratic candidate John Fetterman to the US Senate. Pennsylvania voters also rejected an election denier, Doug Mastriano, in the race for state governor, and made history by electing Democrat Summer Lee as the state’s first Black woman to serve in Congress.\n\nMaryland voters, meanwhile, elected Democrat Wes Moore as their state’s first Black governor. And in New England, Maura Healey became Massachusetts’ first female governor. She’s also the first out lesbian to win a state governorship anywhere in the US.\n\nDemocracy, freedom and equality also won out on ballot issues.\n\nIn unfinished business, voters tackled slavery, permanently abolishing “involuntary servitude” in four states – Vermont, Oregon, Alabama and Tennessee. (Louisiana held on to the slavery clause under its constitution, however.)\n\nDespite efforts to limit voting rights across the nation, voters in Alabama approved a measure requiring that any change to state election law goes into effect at least six months before a general election. And, in Kentucky, voters narrowly beat back an amendment that would have removed constitutional protections for abortion rights – one of several instances in which voters refused to accept restrictive reproductive rights measures.\n\nStill, the highlight of my midterms night was watching 25-year-old Maxwell Frost win a US congressional race in Florida – holding a Democratic seat in a state whose 2022 results skewed red, no less. More and more, we are seeing young people energized, voting and stepping up with fresh ideas to lead this democracy.

Despite his efforts, many of his favorites not only lost but denied the GOP the usual out-party wave of wins that come in midterm elections. This leaves a diminished Trump with the challenge of deciding what to do next.\n\nIn the short term, the man who so often returns to his well-worn playbook resumed his years-long effort to ruin Americans’ confidence in any election his team loses. “Protest, protest, protest,” he told his followers, even before all the polls closed. In a sign of his declining power, no mass protests ensued.\n\nNevertheless, false claims of election fraud will likely be a major theme if he follows through on his loudly voiced hints that he plans to run for the White House again in 2024.\n\nTo run or not to run is now the main question. It’s not an easy choice. Trump could end up like other one-term presidents he has mocked, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, who retreated from politics and devoted themselves to new interests. However, he has other options. He could revive his television career – Fox News? – or return to his businesses. Or, he could develop a new role as leader of an organization that can exploit his prodigious fundraising ability, and give him a platform for grabbing attention, while leaving him plenty of time for golf.\n\nRunning could forestall the various legal problems he faces, but he has lawyers who might accomplish the same goal. Fox News is unlikely to pay enough, and his businesses are now being watched by a court-appointed overseer. This leaves him with a combination of easy work – fundraising and pontificating – combined with his favorite pastimes: fame, money and fun. What’s not to like?\n\nMichael D’Antonio is the author of the book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book “High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.”\n\nDavid Gergen: A sigh of relief for Americans\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nFor many Americans deeply worried about the future of our democracy, Tuesday’s elections brought a glimmer of hope. Instead of chaos, we had an orderly process of voting. So far, the streets have been free of violence, the courts are not clogged with petitions to overthrow the results and many election deniers have been cast aside. Overall, this was an election that rejected the extremists and rallied the friends of democracy. Whatever your political leanings, that is very good news.\n\nIt was especially encouraging to see voters of younger generations turn out in droves. John Della Volpe, the pollster for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, told me that this was the third straight national election – 2018, 2020 and now 2022 – in which the youth vote has surged. And their votes mattered: Drawing upon exit polls, Volpe estimates that voters over 40 were likely to vote for Republican candidates while voters under 40 went for Democrats – and those under 40 were the determining factor.\n\nIt was also inspiring that a number of newcomers to the political arena did so well in pledging to work with others across the aisle. There is no better example than Wes Moore, who was elected the first Black governor of Maryland. Moore had never run for office before, but he had a compelling background – a combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne, a powerful leader in the nonprofit world and far more – and he spoke with a humility that appealed.\n\nThis was also an election, of course, that will go down in history as a huge surprise. Give credit where it is due – President Joe Biden pulled it off even though his approval ratings were fairly abysmal. Now the question is whether he can translate his success (and that of other Democrats) into greater progress in governing. Knowing how recalcitrant his opponents can be, he was smart to reach out to Republican leaders within hours.\n\nBottom line: Tough days still lie ahead, but for one of the first times in recent memory, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief that there are still people in the public arena hungry to bring us together again.\n\nDavid Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN.

Gov. Hochul now has to deliver\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy of Jill Filipovic\n\nDemocrat Kathy Hochul won the New York State gubernatorial race, and thank goodness. Her opponent, Lee Zeldin, is not your typical moderate Republican who usually stands a chance in a blue state. Instead, he’s an abortion opponent who wanted voters to simply trust he wouldn’t mess with New York’s abortion laws.\n\nZeldin was endorsed by the National Rifle Association when he was in Congress. He is a Trump acolyte who voted against certifying the 2020 election in Congress, after texting with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and reportedly planning to contest the outcome of the 2020 election before the results were even in.\n\nNew Yorkers sent a definitive message: Our values matter, even in moments of profound uncertainty.\n\nPlus, Hochul made history as the first woman elected to the governor’s office in New York.\n\nThis race was, in its final days, predicted to be closer than it actually was. Part of that was simply the usual electoral math: The minority party typically has an advantage in the midterms, and Republicans are a minority in Washington, DC, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress. And polling in New York state didn’t look as good for Hochul as it should have in a solidly blue state: Voters who talked to pollsters emphasized crime fears and the economy; abortion rights were galvanizing, but didn’t seem as definitive in an election for a governor vastly unlikely to have an abortion criminalization bill delivered to her desk.\n\nThe polls were imperfect. It turns out that New Yorkers are, in fact, New Yorkers: Not cowed by overblown claims of crime (while I think crime is indeed a problem Democrats should address, New York City remains one of the safest places in the country); determined to defend the racial, ethnic and sexual diversity that makes our state great; and committed to standing up against the tyranny of an anti-democratic party that would force women into pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nHowever, Democrats shouldn’t take this win for granted. The issues voters raised – inflation, crime – are real concerns. And the reasons many voters turned out – abortion rights, democratic norms – remain under threat.\n\nHochul’s job now is to address voter concerns, while standing up for New York values: Openness, decency, freedom for all. Because that’s what New Yorkers did today: The majority of us didn’t cast our ballots from a place of fear and reaction, but from the last dregs of hope and optimism. We voted for what we want. And we now want our governor to deliver.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nDouglas Heye: In North Carolina, the issue of crime loomed large\n\nDouglas Heye Jeremy Freeman\n\nNorth Carolina’s Senate race received less attention than contests in some other states – possibly a result of the campaign having lesser-known candidates than states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nIn the waning weeks of the race, multiple polls had the candidates – Democratic former state Supreme Court chief justice Cheri Beasley and Republican US House Rep. Ted Budd – separated by a percentage point or less.\n\nPerhaps more than in any other Senate campaign, the issue of crime loomed large in North Carolina, with Budd claiming in his speeches that it had become much more dangerous to walk the streets in the state. That talking point, along with his focus on inflation, appeared to help propel him to victory in Tuesday’s vote.\n\nBeasley, by contrast, focused much of her attention on abortion, making it a central plank of her campaign that she would stand up not just for women’s reproductive rights, but workplace protections and equal pay.\n\nThe two candidates were vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Despite being seen as a red state – albeit that is less solidly Republican than neighboring southern states – North Carolina has elected Democrats as five of the last six governors and two of the last six senators.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama won the state in 2008 but lost it in 2012 by one of the closest margins in the nation. And while Donald Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020, he never received 50% of the vote.\n\nDouglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator.

Nelson\n\nMany of us suspected that Democratic Florida Congresswoman and former House impeachment manager Val Demings would have an uphill battle unseating incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, and weren’t entirely surprised when she lost the race. With 98% of the vote counted, Rubio won easily, garnering 57.8% of the vote to Demings’ 41.1%.\n\nAs it turns out, Tuesday was a tough night all around for Black women running statewide. Beyond Demings’ loss, Judge Cheri Beasley narrowly lost her Senate bid in North Carolina.\n\nAnd in the big heartbreak of the night, Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race to Gov. Brian Kemp – a repeat of her defeat to him four years ago, when the two tangled for what at the time was an open seat.\n\nAbrams shook up the 2018 race by expanding the electoral map, enlisting more women and people of color who turned out in record numbers – but she fell short of punching her ticket to Georgia’s governor’s mansion. And on Tuesday she lost to Kemp by a much wider margin than in 2018.\n\nHad Abrams succeeded, she would have been the first Black woman to become the governor of a US state. After her second straight electoral loss, America is still waiting for that breakthrough.\n\nMeanwhile, an ever bigger winner of the night was Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, who handily defeated Democrat Charlie Crist.\n\nDeSantis’ big night solidifies what some feel is a compelling claim to front-runner status for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, on what turned out to be a strong election night for Republicans in the state.\n\nIt’s hard for a Democrat to win statewide in the deep South. And as Demings, Beasley and Abrams have shown, it’s particularly tough for a Black woman to win statewide in the region: In fact, it’s never been done.\n\nAll three women were well-qualified and well-funded stars in their party. But, when we look at the final vote tallies, it tells a familiar story. Take Demings, for example, a former law enforcement officer – she was Orlando’s police chief – and yet, she did not get the big law enforcement endorsements. Rubio did, although he never wore the blue.\n\nThat was a big red flag for me, and it showed how much gender and race still play in the minds of male voters and power brokers of my generation and older. For Black women, a double burden of both race and gender at play. It is the nagging story of our lives.\n\nAs for Abrams, I think Kemp was helped by backing away from Trump and modulating his campaign message to appeal to suburban women and independents.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, just didn’t have the same support and enthusiasm this time around for her candidacy. And that is unfortunate, but for her to lose by such a big margin says much more.\n\nAt the end of the day however, these three women have nothing to regret. They ran great campaigns, and they created great future platforms for themselves. And they each put one more crack in the glass ceiling facing candidates for the US Senate and governors’ mansions.\n\nSophia A. Nelson is a journalist and author of the new book “Be the One You Need: 21 Life Lessons I Learned Taking Care of Everyone but Me.”\n\nDavid Thornburgh: Independent voters were the key in Pennsylvania\n\nDavid Thornburgh Courtesy David Thornburgh\n\nReflections on the morning after Election Day can be a little fuzzy: Chalk it up to a late night, incomplete data and a still-forming narrative. Still, as a longtime Pennsylvania election-watcher, I see three clear takeaways:\n\n1) Pennsylvanians don’t take to extreme anti-establishment candidates. The GOP candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano, broke the mold of just about any statewide candidate in the last few decades.\n\nThe state that delivered wins to center-right and center-left candidates like my father Gov, Dick Thornburgh, Sen. Bob Casey and Gov, Tom Ridge gave establishment Democrat Josh Shapiro a wipeout double-digit victory.\n\n2) “You’re not from here and I am” and “Stick it to the man” proved to be sufficiently powerful messages for alt-Democrat John Fetterman to win his Senate race, albeit by a much smaller margin.\n\nAmplified by more than $300 million in campaign spending (making PA’s the most expensive Senate race in the country), those two simple themes spoke to the quirky, stubborn authenticity that is a longstanding strand of Pennsylvania’s political DNA.\n\n3) In the home of Independence Hall, independent voters made a significant difference. Pretty much every poll since the beginning of both marquee races showed the two party candidates with locked in lopsided mirror-image margins among members of their own party.\n\nOver 90% of Democrats said they’d vote for Shapiro or Fetterman and close to 90% of Republicans said the same of Mastriano or Oz. The 20 to 30% of PA voters who consider themselves independent voters may have been more decisive than most tea-leaves readers gave them credit for.\n\nMost polls showed Shapiro and Fetterman with whopping leads among independent voters. They may not have been the same independent voters: Shapiro’s indy supporters could be former GOP voters disaffected by Trump, and Fetterman’s indy squad could be young voters mobilized by the abortion rights issue (about half of young voters are independents nationally).\n\nThe growing significance of this independent vote in close elections may increase pressure on both parties to repeal closed primaries so that indy voters can vote in those elections. Both parties will want to have more time and opportunity to court them in the future.\n\nWith Florida ripening to a deeper and deeper Red, Pennsylvania may loom larger and larger as the most contested, consequential swing state in the country: well-worth watching as we move inexorably to 2024.\n\nDavid Thornburgh is a longtime Pennsylvania civic leader.

There was a palpable sense of excitement and urgency around the election on campus. For many young people, especially young women, there was one motivating issue that drove their participation: abortion rights.\n\nOne of the most important and contentious issues on the ballot in Michigan was Proposal 3 (commonly known as Prop 3), which codifies the right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms, such as birth control, into the Michigan state constitution. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Michiganders have feared the return of a 1931 law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, and contains felony criminal penalties for abortion providers.\n\nThough the courts have prevented that old law from taking effect, voters were eager to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution, and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 3 with over 55% of voters approving the proposal. This is a major feat given the coordinated campaign against the proposal. Both pro-life groups and the Catholic Church strongly opposed it, and many ads claimed it was “too confusing and too extreme.”\n\nThe issue of abortion was a major focal point of the gubernatorial campaign between Gov, Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon. Pro-Whitmer groups consistently highlighted Dixon’s support of a near-total abortion ban and her past comments that having a rapist’s baby could help a victim heal. Whitmer’s resounding win in the purple state of Michigan is certainly due, in part, to backlash against Dixon’s extreme positions on the issue.\n\nAfter the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, so many young voters felt helpless and despondent about the future of abortion rights. However, instead of throwing in the towel, Michigan voters showed up and displayed their support for Whitmer and Prop 3, showing that Michiganders support bodily autonomy and the right to choose.\n\nIsabelle Schindler is a senior at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy. She is a field director for College Democrats on her campus and has worked as a UMICH Votes Fellow to promote voting.\n\nLindsey Mantoan: Expectations are high for Oregon’s new governor\n\nLindsey Mantoan Courtesy of Lindsey Mantoan\n\nOregon’s closely-watched gubernatorial race has been called for Democrat Tina Kotek, who edged out Republican Christine Drazan. Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, whose campaign received $3.75 million from Nike founder Phil Knight, conceded early Tuesday night, having garnered 9% of the vote – a clear rejection of the idea that big donors can buy elections.\n\nAs Kotek takes the baton from Democrat Kate Brown, the least-popular governor in the country, she’ll confront a rising tide of homelessness in Portland. Along with drug use and violent crime, homelessness tops concerns of the city’s voters, and Kotek brings to Salem a legislative track-record of tackling the issue head on.\n\nKotek’s victory indicates that Oregonians remain concerned about issues Democrats focus on, with voters this cycle passing one of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. The electorate also overwhelmingly approved a measure amending the state constitution to penalize lawmakers who walk out of legislative sessions in order to stymie bill passage, a strategy the Republican caucus deployed in 2019 and 2020 in opposition to vaccine, gun regulation and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bills.\n\nAnd, in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights loomed large in this gubernatorial election, with Kotek vowing to enshrine legal protections for Oregon abortion providers and to establish a fund to increase access to reproductive health care. Against a sea of Republican-led anti-LGBTQ initiatives across the country, Kotek also makes history as one of the first two openly-lesbian governors (Maura Healey, who won the governor’s race in Massachusetts, is the other).\n\nWhen she entered the race, Drazan declared this would be “a Republican year” in Oregon and across the nation. The “red wave” Republicans hoped for failed to materialize, but they came shockingly close to taking the governorship in a Democratic stronghold. Voters have signaled that while they’re staying blue for now, the state has serious problems – and they expect Democrats to step up and get results.\n\nLindsey Mantoan, an Oregon resident, is an associate professor of theater and resident dramaturg at Linfield University.

In the end, it wasn’t – with author and political newcomer J.D. Vance defeating Rep. Tim Ryan by over six percentage points.\n\nRepublicans also swept every statewide office in Ohio, including the elections for justices on the Ohio Supreme Court who, for the first time, had their political party listed next to their names on the ballot. This will give the Republicans a dependable majority on state’s highest court, which is significant since there is an ongoing unresolved legal battle over the drawing of state and federal legislative districts.\n\nIt is now safe to say that Ohio, for so long the quintessential swing state, is a Republican state. What happened is simple to explain: White, working-class voters have become a solid part of the Republican coalition in the Buckeye State. In 2016, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump convinced these voters that the Democratic Party had abandoned them to progressive and internationalist interests with values they did not share. This shift was symbolized by the movement of voters in the former manufacturing hub of Northeast Ohio, once the most Democratic part of the state, to the GOP.\n\nThe question going into 2022 was whether the Republicans could keep these voters if Trump was not on the ballot. The Democrats recruited Rep. Tim Ryan to run for the Senate because he was from Northeast Ohio, having grown up just north of Youngstown. They hoped that he could win those working-class voters back, and Ryan designed his campaign around working-class economic interests, distancing himself from Washington, DC, Democrats and even opposing President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. Once the votes were counted, however, Ryan performed only slightly better than Biden had in Northeast Ohio. In fact, he even lost Trumbull County, the place where he grew up and whose voters he represented in Washington for two decades.\n\nOhio Democrats will face another test in two years, when the Democratic Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown will be on the ballot. Brown won in 2018, but given last night’s result, the Republicans will have no problem recruiting a quality candidate to run for a seat that, right now, at least leans Republican.\n\nPaul Sracic is a professor of politics and international relations at Youngstown State University and the coauthor of “Ohio Politics and Government” (Congressional Quarterly Press, 2015).

Davis Courtesy Dan Gleiter\n\nPennsylvanians clearly rejected the worst of right-wing extremism on Nov. 8, sending a strong message to former President Donald Trump that his endorsement doesn’t guarantee victory in the Keystone State.\n\nTrump proved to be a two-time loser in the commonwealth this election cycle, despite stirring up his base with screaming rallies for Republican candidates Dr. Mehmet Oz, Doug Mastriano and Rep. Scott Perry.\n\nAnd a lot of people are breathing a long, hard sign of relief.\n\nMastriano, who CNN projects will lose the race for the state’s governor to Democrat Josh Shapiro, scared many Pennsylvanians with his brash, take-no-prisoners Trump swagger. He inflamed racial tensions, embraced Christian nationalism, and once said women who violated his proposed abortion ban should be charged with murder. On top of all that, he’s an unapologetic election denier.\n\nDr. Oz, meanwhile, couldn’t shake his carpetbagger baggage, and Oprah’s rejection – on November 4, she endorsed his rival and now-victorious candidate in the Senate race, John Fetterman – seems to have carried more weight than Trump’s rallies, at least in the feedback I’ve received from readers and community members.\n\nAll of this should compel some serious soul-searching among Republican leadership in Pennsylvania. What could have they been thinking to place all their marbles on someone so outside of the mainstream as Mastriano? Did they think Pennsylvanians wouldn’t check Oz’s address? Will they rethink their hardline stance on abortion?\n\nIn a widely-watched House race, Harrisburg City Councilwoman Shamaine Daniels made a valiant Democratic effort to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Perry, after the party’s preferred candidate pulled out of the race. But her lack of name recognition and inexperience on the state or national stage impacted her ability to establish a base of her own. So the five-term incumbent, who played a role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, will return to Washington – though perhaps with a clipped wing.\n\nMany Pennsylvanians may be staunch conservatives, but we proved we’re not extremists – and we won’t embrace Trump or his candidates if they threaten the very foundations of democracy.\n\nJoyce M.

Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock, all Democrats, won in the Peach State. There has been a raging debate in Georgia political circles since then as to whether these races signal a long-term left turn toward the Democratic Party, caused by shifting demographics, or whether they were merely a negative reaction to former President Donald Trump. Tuesday’s results point strongly to the latter.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp, who had rebuffed Trump’s demand to overturn the 2020 presidential result, cruised to a convincing reelection on Tuesday with a pro-growth message by defeating the Democrats’ rising star Stacey Abrams by some 300,000 votes. His coattails also propelled other Republican state candidates to victory – including the Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who had also defied the former President – and helped to keep the Georgia General Assembly firmly in GOP hands.\n\nHowever, before sliding Georgia from a purple political state back into the solid red state column, we still have one more contest to look forward to: a runoff for the US Senate, echoing what happened in Georgia’s last set of Senate races.\n\nGeorgia requires candidates to win over 50% of the vote and the presence of a Libertarian on the ticket has thrown the heated race between Warnock, the incumbent senator and senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Georgia football great Herschel Walker into an overtime runoff campaign to be decided on December 6.\n\nBoth Walker and Warnock survived November 8 to fight another day despite different strong headwinds facing each of them. For Warnock, it has been Biden’s low favorability rating – hovering around 40% nationwide, and only 38% in Georgia, according to Marist. For Walker, it has been the steady drumbeat of personal allegations rolled out over the past few months, some admitted to and others staunchly denied.\n\nWarnock has faced his challenge by emphasizing his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues and occasionally disagreeing with the President on others. Walker, who is backed by Trump, has pulled from the deep well of admiration many Georgians feel for the former college football star.\n\nBoth of these strategies were strong enough to get them into a runoff, but which strategy will work in that arena? The answer could be crucial to determining which party controls the US Senate, depending on the result of other races that have yet to be called. Stay tuned while Georgians enjoy having the two candidates for Thanksgiving dinner and into the holiday season.\n\nEdward Lindsey is a former Republican member of the Georgia House of Representatives and its majority whip.

Mack Donnell Harmon\n\nIn his bid to win a seat in the US Senate, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to appeal to working class voters who felt abandoned by establishment Democrats. Those blue collar voters – many of them formerly members of his party – overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for Ryan, his strategy failed. He lost to J.D. Vance by a decisive margin, according to election projections.\n\nIt was, perhaps, a predictable ending for a candidate who threw away the traditional approach of rallying your base and instead courted the almost non-existent, moderate Trump voter. And it’s a shame. Had Ryan won, Ohio would have had two Democratic senators. The last time that happened was almost 30 years ago, when Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn represented our state.\n\nBut in wooing Republicans and right-leaning moderates, Ryan abandoned many of Ohio’s left-leaning Democrats who brought him to the dance.\n\nThat approach was perhaps most evident in his ads. In a campaign spot in which he is shown tossing a football at various computer screens showing messages he disapproves of, he hurls the ball at one emblazoned with the words “Defund the Police” and dismisses what he disdainfully calls “the culture wars.”\n\nAnother ad showed Ryan, gun in hand, hitting his mark at target practice, as the words “Not too bad for a Democrat” appear on the screen. To imply you’re pro-gun rights when majority of Americans support gun control legislation – and when your party explicitly embraces a pro-gun control stance is bewildering. Ryan’s ads on the economy began to parrot the anti-China rhetoric taken up by Republicans. And when President Joe Biden announced his student debt plan in an effort to invigorate the Democratic bringing economic relief to millions of millennial voters, Ryan opposed the move.\n\nAs a Black woman living in a metropolitan area, I would have liked to see him reach out to communities of color, perhaps by making an appearance with African American members of Ohio’s congressional delegation Rep. Joyce Beatty or Rep. Shontel Brown. But I would have settled for one ad addressing the economic or social concerns of people who don’t live in the Rust Belt.\n\nRyan might have won if he’d gotten the kind of robust backing from his own party that Vance got from his – and if he’d courted his Democratic base.\n\nBrianna N.

Tony Evers surviving a challenge from businessman Tim Michels and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson barely holding off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.\n\nIn late February, Johnson, who Democrats hoped might be a beatable incumbent, was viewed favorably by only 33% of Wisconsin’s voters, according to the Marquette University Law School poll. He was viewed unfavorably by 45% of the electorate with 21% saying they didn’t know what to think of him or hadn’t heard enough about him. He finished the election cycle still seen unfavorably by 46% with 43% of the voters holding a favorable view of him.\n\nHowever, Democrats decided to run possibly the worst candidate if they wanted to win against Johnson. At one point in August, the relatively unknown Barnes actually led Johnson by 7%. But familiarity with Barnes didn’t help him. Crime was the third most concerning issue for Wisconsin voters this election cycle, according to the Marquette University Law School poll, and Johnson’s campaign successfully attacked Barnes for statements in support of decreasing or redirecting police funding and for reducing the prison population. In the end, Johnson came out victorious.\n\nSo, with Republicans winning in the Senate, what saved Evers in the gubernatorial race? Perhaps it was women voters.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade meant Wisconsin’s abortion ban from 1849 went back into effect. Michels supported the no-exceptions law but then flip-flopped and said he could support exceptions for rape and incest. Johnson, for his part, successfully deflected the issue by saying he wanted Wisconsin’s abortion law to go to referendum.\n\nAnother issue that may have soured women voters on Michels was the allegation of a culture of sexual harassment within his company. Evers’ campaign unsurprisingly jumped at the opportunity to argue that “the culture comes from the top.” (In response to the allegations against his company, Michel said: “These unproven allegations do not reflect the training and culture at Michels Corporation. Harassment in the workplace should not be condoned, nor tolerated, nor was it under Michels Corporation leadership.”) Michels’ divisive primary fight against former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also didn’t help his appeal to women voters, especially in Kleefisch’s home county of Waukesha, formerly a key to a Republican victory in Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republicans are going to win in 2024, they need to figure out how to attract the support of suburban women.\n\nJames Wigderson is the former editor of RightWisconsin.com, a conservative-leaning news website, and the author of a twice-weekly newsletter, “Life, Under Construction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/exit-polls-midterm-election-analysis/index.html", "title": "Exit polls: High inflation dominates voters' views in the midterm ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSoaring prices were top of mind for voters as they cast ballots in this year’s midterm elections, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nNearly a third of voters said inflation was the issue that mattered most in deciding how they voted for House candidates. And more than 7 in 10 of them opted for Republicans.\n\nInflation also dominated in most of the exit polls conducted in 11 key states. At least two-thirds of those concerned about high prices in several crucial states cast ballots for Republican Senate candidates.\n\nConsumers have been contending with soaring prices for food, gas and other essentials for more than a year as inflation has hovered around 40-year highs.\n\nAround three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.\n\nVoters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”\n\nThe exit poll results are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy.\n\nThough President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have tried to tout the measures they’ve taken to lower costs, many voters aren’t giving them credit. Just under half of voters for House candidates said Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only around one-third said they are helping, exit polls found.\n\nEven Biden’s plan to forgive some student loan debt has not rustled up widespread support. Roughly half of voters approve of the effort, while nearly the same share disapprove.\n\nDespite voters’ angst about the economy, the Republicans’ red wave does not seem to have fully materialized. Abortion was also a significant factor in the election, with more than a quarter of voters listing it as a top issue. About 61% said they were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and about 7 in 10 of those voters backed a Democratic House candidate.\n\nHere are more takeaways from CNN’s preliminary 2022 national and state exit polls.\n\nVoters who valued ‘honesty and integrity’ favored Fetterman\n\nPennsylvania voters who most valued “honesty and integrity” in their Senate candidate favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz, according to the early results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman also won among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cared about people like them, while Oz won among the smaller bloc of voters who prioritized a candidate sharing their values.\n\nCNN projects that Fetterman will defeat Oz to win the open Pennsylvania Senate race, flipping a Republican-held seat.\n\nA majority of female voters, White college-educated voters, voters of color and political independents in the state supported Fetterman, the exit poll finds, while most male voters and White voters without college degrees supported Oz.\n\nMost voters, about 53%, said they disapproved of President Joe Biden’s job performance. But roughly 14% of those who disapproved of Biden cast their ballots for Fetterman, as did nearly all of those who approved of the president. A slim majority of voters in the state said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, with most also saying former President Donald Trump did not play a role.\n\nVoters were close to evenly split on whether or not Oz’s views were too extreme, while about 53% said Fetterman’s views were not.\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania were closely split over whether Fetterman’s health was good enough to represent the state effectively. Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Oz has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\n2:05 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy and Tami Luhby\n\nMost voters don’t want Biden to run in 2024\n\nMore than two-thirds of voters for House candidates don’t want President Joe Biden to run for reelection in 2024, according to the early results of the national exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 independent voters and roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters said they don’t want Biden to be in the 2024 presidential campaign. Fewer than 6 in 10 Democratic voters thought he should run.\n\nJust under 6 in 10 independent voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, and about the same share disapprove of the job he’s doing as president.\n\nOnly 1 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of the president and slightly more disapprove of his job performance.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 GOP voters have an unfavorable view of Biden and disapprove of the job he’s doing.\n\nWhen it comes to former President Donald Trump, two-thirds of independent voters and more than 9 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of him. Just over three-quarters of GOP voters have a favorable view.\n\nIndependent voters comprise about a quarter of the electorate, while Democratic voters are roughly one-third and Republican voters are just over one-third of the electorate.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nVance draws support from suburban and rural voters, as well as from men, White voters and older voters\n\nNearly 6 in 10 suburban voters and nearly the same share of rural voters favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, US Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to preliminary results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAlso, nearly 6 in 10 men who cast ballots voted for Vance, about the same share as White voters who picked the GOP candidate. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older and voters without college degrees opted for Vance, as well.\n\nRyan was the preferred candidate of just over half of women who voted, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly half of independent voters cast ballots for the Democrat. Just under 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state.\n\nNearly 6 in 10 voters from union households voted for Ryan, according to the exit poll later on Wednesday morning. Initially, the exit poll had shown that about the same share supported Vance.\n\nVoters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan.\n\nVance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.\n\n1:15 p.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters saw Don Bolduc’s views as ‘too extreme’\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters called Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc’s views “too extreme,” according to the early results of the New Hampshire exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Only about 43% said the same of his Democratic rival, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan.\n\nCNN projects that Hassan will win a second Senate term in New Hampshire, defeating the Trump-backed Bolduc.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s job approval rating in the state is negative, per the exit poll, with only about 42% of voters approving. But roughly 1 in 5 Biden disapprovers, nevertheless, cast their vote for Hassan.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of voters in the state – including similar shares of both candidates’ supporters – said that party control of the Senate was very important to their vote.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMost voters express at least some confidence in fairness of elections in their states\n\nNationally, more than 9 in 10 Democrats who voted in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state were being conducted fairly and accurately, according to early national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. That’s a level of confidence shared by about 8 in 10 independents, and a smaller two-thirds of Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats’ confidence was robust across most key battleground states, Republicans’ views of the election system varied much more significantly by state.\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 Republicans in Florida, New Hampshire, Texas and Ohio said they were confident that their state’s elections were accurate and fair, as did more than 7 in 10 in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nBut only about 6 in 10 Republicans in Michigan, Nevada and Arizona said they were confident in their state’s elections. And in Pennsylvania, only about half expressed such confidence.\n\nVoters were also deeply concerned about the state of the country’s democracy. About 3 in 10 said that they viewed democracy in the US today as at least somewhat secure, with about two-thirds feeling that democracy in the country is somewhat or very threatened.\n\nSlightly over 6 in 10 voters accepted that Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020, while slightly over one-third denied the results of that election.\n\nUpdated 11:39 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters who disliked both parties broke for Republicans\n\nMost voters in this year’s election view one party positively, and the other negatively – nationally, about 4 in 10 have a favorable view of only the Democratic Party, and a similar share have a favorable view of only the Republican Party, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Unsurprisingly, these voters almost unanimously supported their favored party in their district’s congressional election.\n\nBut there’s also a smaller bloc of voters – about 11% of the electorate, nationwide – who dislike both parties. This group broke in favor of the Republicans, with nearly 6 in 10 favoring a GOP House candidate this year. That’s a shift from 2018, when voters who disliked both parties were about evenly split in their vote.\n\nVoters who were most upset with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade differed from those who felt less profoundly unhappy with the decision, the exit polls show. Those who were angry about the overturning of Roe (about 39% of the electorate) overwhelmingly voted Democratic for the House (about 85% picked the Democratic candidate). Those who were dissatisfied but not angry (about 21% of the electorate) narrowly favored the GOP.\n\nThere was also a difference between voters who were most pessimistic about the economy, and those who felt less strongly negative. While nearly 9 in 10 voters who said the economy was poor voted for a GOP House candidate, about 6 in 10 who described the economy as “not so good” backed a Democratic candidate.\n\nTo some extent, these divides reflect the partisan differences already baked into views on abortion and the economy. Voters who considered themselves Democrats were roughly 59 points more than voters who considered themselves Republican to say they were angry about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, were about 28 points likelier than Democrats to call the economy poor.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nFlorida voters weigh in on Trump and DeSantis\n\nWhat do Florida voters think about the possibility two Florida men could run for president in 2024? Exit polls from the Sunshine State offer some clues.\n\nWith Donald Trump signaling a potential announcement next week, 33% of Florida voters said they want to see the former president run in 2024, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThere appears to be more of an appetite for a bid by Ron DeSantis, with 45% of Florida voters saying they want the state’s governor – who CNN projects will win reelection – to seek the presidency in 2024.\n\nDeSantis’ strength is reflected in the Florida exit polls, which show the governor winning Latinos in the state by 13 points. In 2020, Trump trailed Biden among Latino voters in Florida by 7 points. DeSantis also held a slight edge among independents, whom Biden carried in the state by 11 points. Those could be selling points if DeSantis and Trump collide in a 2024 GOP primary.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Terence Burlij\n\nPennsylvania voters are split over Fetterman’s health\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman’s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before he won the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had.\n\nOz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\nVoters also split over which candidate’s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz.\n\nMore than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most.\n\nMen and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman.\n\nFor voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate.\n\nBut among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.\n\n8:44 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVast majority of North Carolina voters think the economy is not in good shape\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 North Carolina voters said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” according to the preliminary results of the North Carolina Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in the state said inflation has caused them and their family severe or moderate hardship.\n\nAbout half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only 35% think they are helping.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 North Carolina voters approve of Biden, while more than half disapprove.\n\n8:19 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nOhio voters think the economy is weak\n\nMore than three-quarters of Ohio voters said the nation’s economy was “poor” or “not so good,” according to the preliminary results of the Ohio Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAnd nearly three-quarters of Buckeye State voters said inflation has caused their family severe or moderate hardship, with nearly 2 in 10 saying their difficulties were severe.\n\nMore than half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting, while about one-third said they are helping.\n\nThe president is not that popular among Ohio voters – more than half disapprove of him, with more than 4 in 10 approving.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock loses some support among Black and Hispanic Georgians\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday’s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThe votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close.\n\nRoughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found.\n\nWarnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens.\n\nStill, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots.\n\nA majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock.\n\nMore than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock holds edge among Georgia voters when it comes to showing ‘good judgment’\n\nGeorgia voters were more likely to say that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has good judgment than they were to say the same of his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, according to the preliminary results of the Georgia exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. But more said Warnock holds views that are too extreme than said the same about Walker.\n\nJust shy of half, about 46%, said only Warnock shows good judgment, with about 28% saying only Walker does, and nearly a fifth that neither candidate does.\n\nVoters in Georgia were close to evenly split on whether or not Warnock’s views were too extreme. Slightly more than 4 in 10 said Walker’s views were too extreme, with just over half saying they were not.\n\nAsked which candidate quality mattered most to their Senate vote, 36% of Georgia voters said they wanted a candidate who shared their values, 32% a candidate who had honesty and integrity, 19% a candidate who cared about people like them, and 8% someone who had the right experience.\n\n7:08 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nPennsylvania voters are not enamored with either Biden or Trump\n\nMore than 4 in 10 of Pennsylvania voters approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job, but a majority disapprove of the president, who was born and raised in Scranton, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nVoters in the commonwealth did not have a high opinion of former President Donald Trump either. Just 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion, while nearly 6 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, just over half of Pennsylvania voters said Biden was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the president was a factor, more than 1 in 10 said they support him, while nearly a third said they oppose him.\n\nMore than half of Pennsylvania voters also said that Trump was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the former president was a factor, close to 1 in 5 said they support him, while about a quarter oppose him.\n\n6:52 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoters trust Republicans more on inflation and crime but lean toward Democrats on abortion\n\nMore voters trust Republicans than Democrats to handle inflation and crime, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nRoughly half of voters said they trusted GOP candidates on those two issues, while more than 4 in 10 voters said they trusted Democratic candidates.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of abortion, however, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n6:30 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoter views on Trump are even more negative than on Biden\n\nWhile voters in this year’s midterm election hold negative views of President Joe Biden, their views of his predecessor are even more negative, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about 37% of voters in this year’s midterms expressed a favorable view of former President Donald Trump, with around 6 in 10 viewing him unfavorably. About 16% of voters said their House vote this year was intended to express support for Trump, with just under 3 in 10 saying it’s intended to express opposition and the rest saying that Trump was not a factor.\n\nVoters’ opinions of the GOP were slightly more positive than their views of Trump, with about 43% viewing the Republican Party favorably and just over half viewing it unfavorably. More than half, about 54%, say the GOP is too extreme.\n\n6:00 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters differ in their top issues\n\nThere’s a significant partisan divide in voters’ priorities and attitudes this year, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nNearly half of voters who supported a GOP House candidate called inflation their top issue, with fewer than 15% picking any other issue as their priority. Among voters who backed a Democratic candidate, about 44% called abortion their top issue, with 15% or fewer picking any other issue.\n\nMeanwhile, midterm voters were mostly opposed to the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the preliminary national exit polls.\n\nSlightly fewer than 4 in 10 said they felt enthusiastic or satisfied about the decision, while about 21% said they felt dissatisfied, and roughly 4 in 10 that they were angry.\n\nAbout 60% of all voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 51% among voters who turned out for the 2020 general election.\n\n5:52 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\n2022 voters may skew older compared with 2018\n\nEarly indications suggest that this year’s midterm electorate may look older than the voters in the 2018 midterms, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about a tenth of voters in this election were under age 30, while roughly one-third were age 65 or older. In 2018, about 13% were under 30, and about 26% were 65 or older.\n\nThe electorate this year was split roughly between those who generally identify as Democrats (about 34%) and those who generally identify as Republicans (about 35%), with the remainder consisting of political independents and members of other parties. In 2018, Democrats made up a slightly larger voting bloc, about 37%.\n\nAbout 76% of voters were White, and about 24% were voters of color. White voters with college degrees look to be a slightly larger share of the electorate this year – about 40% per the preliminary data, compared with 31% four years ago. By contrast, voters of color without a college degree look to have made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate this year.\n\n5:29 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nInflation is top issue for voters, followed by abortion\n\nInflation tops voters’ list of concerns in this year’s midterm elections, with abortion a close second, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nApproximately one-third called inflation the most important issue to their vote, with about 27% citing abortion. The remainder were roughly divided between picking crime, gun policy and immigration as their chief concerns.\n\nThe electorate’s views of the economy are largely gloomy. Only about one-quarter of voters felt positively about the current condition of the economy, with roughly three-quarters viewing it negatively – and about 4 in 10 saying it’s downright poor.\n\nThat’s more pessimistic than in the 2018 midterms, when 68% of voters said the state of the economy was excellent or good, and the 2020 presidential election, when 49% said the same.\n\nAbout 46% of voters in this election say that their family’s financial situation had worsened over the past two years, while only about 1 in 5 said it had improved.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in this year’s election say that inflation has caused hardship for them and their family over the past year, with about 20% saying it’s been a severe hardship. And about 6 in 10 say that gas prices, specifically, have recently been a hardship.\n\n5:23 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters unhappy with the state of the nation and largely negative on Biden\n\nVoters in this year’s midterm elections are broadly unhappy with the state of the nation and hold largely negative views of President Joe Biden, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 said they were less than satisfied with the way things are going in the country, with about one-third saying they were not just dissatisfied but angry with the state of the nation.\n\nBiden’s approval rating stands at about 45% among voters in this year’s election – nearly identical to then-Donald Trump’s 45% approval rating four years ago among 2018 midterm voters. And voters in this election were more than twice as likely to strongly disapprove of Biden as they were to strongly approve of him.\n\nJust shy of half of voters this year said that Biden’s policies are mostly hurting the country, with about 36% saying his policies are mostly helping, and the rest that they’re making no difference.\n\nMany voters didn’t see their congressional vote as a referendum on the president – close to half said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, while about 18% said their vote was to express support for Biden, and about one-third that it was to express opposition to him.\n\nUpdated 5:13 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 2022 national exit polls include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error – which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest exit poll numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results.\n\nCNN Exit Polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. They were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 250 polling locations. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted in-person at 72 early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 14,657 respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and telephone and online polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 45 polling locations in Pennsylvania among Election Day voters. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 2,586 voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nThe Georgia Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 40 polling locations in Georgia among Election Day voters. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted in-person at early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 4,364 voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nThe Ohio Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 25 polling locations in Ohio among Election Day voters. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted in-person at early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 3,464 voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nThe North Carolina Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool.

The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted in-person at early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 3,855 voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n\nThe New Hampshire Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and telephone and online polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 30 polling locations in New Hampshire among Election Day voters.

Bush described during his own post-midterms press conference in 2006 nor the “shellacking’” Barack Obama said Democrats endured in 2010.\n\nInstead, the failure of a so-called “red wave” to materialize Tuesday night had Biden appearing confident, reflecting the mood of Democrats, including those inside the White House, who are feeling enthused and vindicated following an election season where the president’s political aptitude was questioned. At the time of Biden’s remarks, CNN has not been able to project the future majorities of the House or the Senate.\n\nThe president did concede that the results are not a ringing endorsement of his approach. Voters, he said, “were also clear that they are still frustrated. I get it. I understand it’s been a really tough few years this country for so many people.”\n\n“While any seat lost is painful … Democrats had a strong night. And we lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic president’s first midterm election in the last 40 years. We had the best midterm for governors since 1986,” Biden remarked.\n\nThe president, who turns 80 later this month, also said he is not in “any hurry” to announce a bid for reelection in 2024, reiterating that his timeline remains “early next year.”\n\n“Our intention is to run again. That’s been our intention, regardless of what the outcome of this election was,” he told reporters. Still, Biden added, he’s “a great respecter of fate,” calling another run “a family decision.\n\n“I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re gonna have discussions about it,” he said.\n\nAnd Biden had a message to those opposed to another presidential bid: “Watch me.”\n\nThe future of both parties\n\nThe president said he will be inviting leaders of both parties in Congress to the White House to discuss where they can work together when he returns from his upcoming overseas trip, adding that he’s prepared to work with elected Republicans on a number of issues. “The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me, as well,” he added.\n\nStill, Biden drew a red line on a number of Republican proposals, saying he’d veto legislation he thinks could make inflation worse, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, as well as any attempt to introduce a national ban on abortion.\n\nBiden said he plans to speak with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – who is mounting a run for House speaker – later on Wednesday.\n\nThe results appeared more likely to prompt soul-searching among Republicans than Democrats, as former President Donald Trump teases an imminent announcement that he is running for the White House again. Many of the candidates Trump endorsed in toss-up races lost or were locked in contests that were too early to call.\n\nFor his part, Biden said on Wednesday that he does not plan to do anything differently in the second half of his presidential term. Instead, he said as his agenda items begin taking effect, Americans would come to see their benefit.\n\n“They’re just finding out what we’re doing,” the president said. “The more they know about what we’re doing, the more support there is.”\n\nStill, Biden and his team still face the prospect of a difficult two years of governing should Republicans seize control of the House. The President’s agenda would likely be sharply curtailed without a Democratic majority. And Republicans have promised investigations into Biden’s administration and family.\n\nBiden said he believes the American public wants the government to “move on and get things done for them,” not lead investigations into him, his family or his administration.\n\n“It’s just, almost comedy,” Biden said of the possible probes. “I can’t control what they’re going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people.”\n\nExit polls also indicated still-simmering dissatisfaction among voters at the country’s economic health. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.\n\nVoters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”\n\nFor the president, improving the country’s pervasive dark mood will be an ongoing challenge despite Democrats outperforming expectations Tuesday. Without a majority in the House, his tools to accomplish that will be more limited.\n\nBiden spent most of his campaign season focused on economic issues, including areas he’d taken action to reduce costs. But he drew some criticism, including from some Democrats, for expanding his closing message to including abortion rights and a defense of democracy.\n\nHeading into Tuesday, Biden advisers were prepared to defend the tactic and were prepared with historic data showing Democrats faring better this year than in previous midterm cycles, which typically result in losses for the sitting president’s party.\n\nUltimately, however, Biden is likely to avoid the finger-pointing and second-guessing. Even with the House losses, this year’s results are among the best for the party in power in recent memory.\n\nBy comparison, Democrats lost 54 seats in 1994, when President Bill Clinton was in office. And Obama’s first midterm election saw his party lose 63 seats.\n\nBiden addresses foreign policy issues and Elon Musk’s influence\n\nSpeaking in front of the press on Wednesday, Biden addressed challenges with two of the nation’s biggest foreign adversaries – China and Russia.\n\nBiden said the timing of Russia’s announcement on retreating from the city of Kherson, Ukraine, was “interesting.”\n\n“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said. He added that where the withdrawal leads and “whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia” remain to be seen.\n\nBiden also said he was told that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia. He also told reporters that he’s hopeful Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who remains detained in Russia, now that the elections are over.\n\nBiden confirmed expected talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week’s G20 summit. Biden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.\n\n“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”\n\nThe president also told reporters that Twitter owner Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.\n\n“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all (I’ll) say.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/politics/2022-state-local-elections-to-watch/index.html", "title": "20 state and local elections to watch this year | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Democratic control of the US House and Senate on the line in this fall’s midterm elections, the races for those chambers have drawn plenty of attention. Republicans appear to be in good position to make gains in November, buoyed, in part, by historic midterm headwinds facing the party in power, economic concerns and President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings.\n\nBut races at the state and local level will also have consequences that extend far beyond this year. New state laws targeting abortion, guns and voting rights, among other issues, have put a spotlight on the state and local officials responsible for signing or enforcing those measures.\n\nDemocratic candidates for governor, secretary of state and attorney general are presenting themselves as bulwarks against full GOP control of their states. Republicans, meanwhile, are eyeing opportunities to either maintain or win control of key state offices, though former President Donald Trump’s involvement in several of those races, and the possibility of nominating candidates who have questioned the 2020 election results, has complicated the calculus.\n\nLooming over most of these races is 2024, with implications for who will control the election infrastructure in key swing states and who will emerge as viable presidential contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, local-level races will have consequences for the future direction of the Democratic Party, while contests for certain state Supreme Court seats will be pivotal to the fight over redistricting, which is expected to continue into this decade.\n\nHere are 20 state and local races to watch in 2022:\n\nGeorgia governor\n\nGov. Brian Kemp, left, and Stacey Abrams. Associated Press\n\nThe anticipated rematch of the fierce 2018 election between now-incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams is finally set after Kemp defeated a Trump-backed primary challenge from former US Sen. David Perdue and Abrams ran unopposed for her party’s nomination.\n\nThat result was a notable mark against Trump’s influence, especially among Georgia Republicans who aren’t ready to trade in their longtime leaders at the former President’s behest. But it was also a show of force for Kemp, who remains very popular with his party – enthusiasm that he’ll need in a race with Abrams.\n\nThe bigger question now is whether Abrams, whose near-miss in 2018 made her a national Democratic star, can close the narrow gap with Kemp in a potentially high-turnout general election despite new Republican-enacted restrictions on voting.\n\nThere are few Democratic politicians better equipped to strategize around those restrictions than Abrams, a longtime voting rights advocate, but the field will almost certainly be tilted against her given Biden’s poor approval numbers. 2018 was a good election year for many Democrats amid a backlash to Trump. But this time around, Abrams is swimming against the national political tide.\n\nPennsylvania governor\n\nThe race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will see Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro face off against Trump-backed state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a fervent promoter of the former President’s 2020 election lies.\n\nA win for Mastriano would give someone who attempted to overturn voters’ will in 2020 power over the election machinery in one of the nation’s most important battlegrounds during the 2024 presidential race. In Pennsylvania, the governor appoints the secretary of state – the person in charge of running the commonwealth’s elections and signing off on its electors.\n\nShapiro, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary, has defended Pennsylvania’s 2020 presidential election result and is emphasizing voting and abortion rights in his campaign.\n\nThe leak of the draft US Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide has roiled elections across the country, including in Pennsylvania. Democratic groups have launched a multimillion-dollar campaign attacking Mastriano for his opposition to abortion rights. Shapiro has argued that should Roe fall, the governor’s role would be crucial in a state where the GOP-controlled legislature has already passed bills that would impose abortion restrictions, which were vetoed by Wolf.\n\nNevada governor\n\nGov. Steve Sisolak Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nDemocratic control of the Silver State is on the line in 2022.\n\nThe party has dominated Nevada in recent years – albeit by narrow margins, a still remarkable turnaround for the once-red state. That could change this fall. Republicans across the country and in Nevada have made inroads with Latino voters, and the GOP hopes that lingering anger over pandemic restrictions and the national antipathy toward full Democratic control of Washington will help them break through in Nevada.\n\nGov. Steve Sisolak, who ended a two-decade Democratic drought in the executive office with his 2018 victory, faces a difficult race likely no matter whom Republicans nominate. GOP hopefuls include Clark County Sheriff Joe Clark, who has Trump’s endorsement, and former US Sen. Dean Heller. But with competitive races for US Senate and House and other statewide offices as well, the results out of Nevada will speak volumes about the political future of the western state.\n\nArizona governor\n\nArizona emerged as a critical battleground in 2020 when Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in almost a quarter-century.\n\nThe GOP race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey will be a test of Trump’s influence on the party. The primary features, among others, TV reporter-turned-politician Kari Lake, who has the former President’s endorsement; former US Rep. Matt Salmon, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2002; and businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robin, a onetime member of the state Board of Regents.\n\nThe front-runner for the Democratic nomination is Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who has come under fire over a racial discrimination case stemming from her time as Democratic leader in the state Senate. Former Nogales Mayor Marco Lopez is also seeking the Democratic nod.\n\nAt stake: full control of Arizona government, where the GOP has held both the governor’s office and the state legislature since 2009.\n\nWisconsin governor\n\nWith the US Supreme Court expected to throw the debate over abortion to the states, Wisconsin could be central to that fight.\n\nThe state is not only hosting a marquee Senate race this year, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has vetoed several bills aimed at curtailing legal abortion, is running for reelection in a state where Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature.\n\nEvers has also used his veto pen to block GOP-led legislation aimed at changing state election laws and expanding gun rights. His positioning as the lone Democrat standing between full GOP control of the state will likely define his campaign. The national mood was behind Evers in 2018, when he unseated Republican Gov. Scott Walker. This year looks very different.\n\nThe GOP field remains largely unsettled ahead of the August 9 primary. Trump has endorsed businessman and Army veteran Tim Michels. Other candidates include former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, Marine veteran Kevin Nicholson and state Rep. Timothy Ramthun, one of the state’s leading promoters of false election conspiracy theories.\n\nThis race also has national implication. Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, and the possibility of an equally close race in 2024 could loom over the gubernatorial contest.\n\nFlorida governor\n\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis won election in 2018 by just under 33,000 votes out of 8.2 million ballots, but he certainly hasn’t governed like he’s running a purple battleground state.\n\nRather, DeSantis has risen to the top echelon of potential 2024 GOP contenders by attacking Disney, creating a new election police force, pushing through a partisan congressional map, banning abortion after 15 weeks without exemptions for rape and incest, promising to lift gun restrictions and signing legislation to restrict how schools teach about racism and sexual orientation and gender identify.\n\nRepublican donors have responded, contributing $117 million to his reelection fight and making him the first gubernatorial candidate in US history to break the nine-figure mark without self-funding. Heading into November, Republicans are looking to dispel any doubt that the state has turned a deeper shade of red.\n\nDemocrats vying to take on DeSantis include US Rep. Charlie Crist, a onetime GOP governor, and state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. But the incumbent is the favorite, and a blowout victory would further boost his resume as he weighs his political future.\n\nTexas governor\n\nGov. Greg Abbott, left, and Beto O'Rourke\n\nThe high-profile race to lead the Lone Star State pits two-term Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, a potential 2024 presidential contender, against Democrat Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman who drew national attention with a near-miss 2018 Senate campaign and an unsuccessful 2020 bid for president.\n\nThe issue of gun rights could play a role in the campaign following the tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in the South Texas town of Uvalde that left 19 students and two teachers dead. O’Rourke confronted Abbott and other Texas officials during a news conference in Uvalde in May after the massacre, saying the governor was “doing nothing” to prevent more gun violence.\n\nAbbott, who has signed legislation loosening gun restrictions, argued that tougher gun laws aren’t “a real solution.”\n\nThe governor has leaned further into hot-button GOP priorities over the past year, signing into law new election and voting restrictions and a ban on abortions after six weeks. That positioning helped him beat out a crowded field of primary challengers in March. Abbott has also been a top critic of the Biden administration, especially on its push to roll back Title 42 – the pandemic-era public health order that has allowed immigration officials to turn back migrants at the border.\n\nWhile O’Rourke gives Democrats their strongest candidate possible, he faces an uphill battle for the governorship in a state where his party has not won a statewide election since 1994 – its longest statewide drought in the country.\n\nAlaska governor\n\nAlaska is debuting a new voting sytem this year that was approved by state voters in 2020 in an attempt to make elections less partisan.\n\nUnder the new system, all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot in the primary, with the top four advancing to the general election. Voters in the fall can rank their choices in order of preference. If no one receives a majority, the candidate in fourth place is eliminated and those votes go to whomever was ranked second on those ballots. The process continues until a candidate reaches a majority.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who has Trump’s support, is facing a challenge from his predecessor, independent Bill Walker, who ended his bid for a second term in 2018 less than three weeks before the election – throwing his support to the Democratic nominee – over concerns that he could not win in a three-way race.\n\nWalker faced backlash while in office for reducing the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend that is given annually to each Alaska resident as he dealt with a budget deficit deepened by a collapse in the price of oil. And that could hamper his comeback attempt. Others in the race include Democratic former state Rep. Les Gara and Republicans Christopher Kurka, a state representative, and Charlie Pierce, the Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor.\n\nMichigan secretary of state\n\nDemocratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is looking to win another four-year term.\n\nBenson rose to national prominence amid the 2020 election fallout – as she defended the election process and results, in the face of efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in the state. At one point, she said, armed protesters showed up outside her home to demand she reverse the outcome.\n\nThis fall, she is expected to face Kristina Karamo, a political newcomer and community college professor who was endorsed at the Michigan GOP state convention in April. Karamo’s nomination is expected to be reaffirmed at an official party vote in August.\n\nKaramo, who has Trump’s endorsement, gained attention after the 2020 election when she alleged witnessing fraud as a poll challenger during the counting of absentee ballots. She also signed on to an unsuccessful US Supreme Court challenge to Biden’s win.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty post-election audits by Michigan’s secretary of state confirmed the accuracy of the 2020 election in the state, which Biden won by more than 150,000 votes. In addition, a GOP-led state Senate investigation found no evidence of widespread fraud in the election.\n\nGeorgia secretary of state\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger Ben Gray/AP\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is coming off a big primary win over fellow Republican Jody Hice, a four-term congressman endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe incumbent famously rejected Trump’s demand to “find” the votes he needed to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia. And while Raffensperger has defended that election as “honest and fair,” he also has embraced much of a controversial law enacted last year in the Peach State that imposes an array of new voting restrictions.\n\nHice, meanwhile, was one of 147 GOP members of Congress who objected to certifying Biden’s victory.\n\nRaffensperger will need to wait a while to learn who his fall opponent will be. State Rep. Bee Nguyen, who helped lead the charge against voting restrictions passed by the legislature, and former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler will meet in a June 21 runoff for the Democratic nomination after neither cleared 50% of the vote in the primary. Nguyen, who has scored endorsements from EMILY’s List and the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, won about 44% of the vote in the May primary to Dawkins-Haigler’s roughly 19%.\n\nArizona secretary of state\n\nArizona, a state that Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes, has become a hotbed of fringe conspiracy theories about election fraud.\n\nThe secretary of state holds special prominence in Arizona as the officeholder is the first in line to succeed the state’s governor in the event of illness or death. The state does not have a lieutenant governor.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Mark Finchem has promoted the falsehood that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump, earning an early endorsement from the former President in his bid for secretary of state.\n\nOther GOP contenders include advertising executive Beau Lane, state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita and state Rep. Shawnna Bolick.\n\nDemocrats will be looking to hold the office Katie Hobbs won in 2018 after more than two decades of uninterrupted GOP control. Vying for the party nod are state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding and Adrian Fontes, the former top election official in the state’s most populous county of Maricopa, home to Phoenix.\n\nColorado secretary of state\n\nDemocratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold is seeking a second term as Colorado’s top election official in a state Biden won by double digits in 2020.\n\nBut the battle for the Republican nomination has seized the spotlight. Tina Peters, the clerk of Mesa County who was indicted by a county grand jury earlier this year as part of a local investigation into a security breach of voting systems, is running to face Griswold this fall.\n\nPeters has denied the charges, saying the investigation is partisan and politically motivated. A district judge, however, recently barred her from overseeing this year’s elections in the county.\n\nDespite her legal woes, Peters received some 60% of the vote at a gathering of Colorado Republicans in April. Former Jefferson County Clerk Pam Anderson, who has pushed back on false claims of 2020 election fraud, is also in the race.\n\nColorado Republicans officially pick their nominee in the June 28 primary. Griswold is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMichigan attorney general\n\nWhile races for state attorney general often receive less attention, the contest in Michigan is emblematic of how significant they could be in 2022, especially if the US Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Dana Nessel will face Trump-endorsed Matt DePerno, a Kalamazoo lawyer who has promoted the former President’s false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 election. DePerno received the state GOP’s endorsement during its April convention and is expected to be formally nominated by the party in August.\n\nNessel, the state’s first openly gay statewide elected official, has prioritized consumer protection and civil rights during her tenure. She has more recently honed in on abortion rights, detailing her past experience with an abortion and declaring she would neither defend nor enforce the state’s 1931 abortion ban, should Roe v. Wade fall.\n\nDePerno has said that he does not support abortion rights under any circumstances and that an overturning of Roe “will be such a great win for the unborn and for states’ rights.”\n\nKansas attorney general\n\nKansas Attorney General candidate Kris Kobach Orlin Wagner/AP\n\nThe race for Kansas attorney general may provide a clear test of whether, even in a deep-red state, the type of Republican nominee still matters.\n\nDemocrats believe the contest could be competitive if Republicans nominate Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and anti-immigration firebrand.\n\nKobach, who has repeatedly made baseless claims about voter fraud and served on Trump’s much-derided commission on election integrity, has a complicated relationship with Kansas voters. After winning races for secretary of state in 2010 and 2014, he lost back-to-back bids for governor, in 2018, and US Senate, in 2020.\n\nIn multiple instances, GOP groups have spent money against Kobach, worried that his name on the ballot could make it easier for Democrats to win. Republicans blame Kobach for losing a winnable gubernatorial race in 2018 to Democrat Laura Kelly, who is up for reelection in November.\n\nKobach, however, has long been closely associated with Trump, something that has already propelled other Republicans to victory in 2022 primaries. Also competing for the GOP nomination are state Sen. Kellie Warren and former federal prosecutor Tony Mattivi. Former police officer and prosecutor Chris Mann is running for the Democratic nod.\n\nIowa attorney general\n\nDemocrat Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in the country, has won reelection in tough years for his party, including the GOP waves of 1994 and 2010. In that latter election, he defeated Republican Brenna Bird – then Brenna Findley – by double digits.\n\nBird, now the Guthrie County attorney, is back for a rematch, and Miller could be in for a different race this year. The once swing state of Iowa has trended red in recent elections – after voting twice for Barack Obama, the state twice backed Trump by comfortable margins. And while Miller has built a brand in Iowa since his first election in 1978, political headwinds facing Democrats this year complicate his bid for an 11th term.\n\nBird, who is running unopposed for the GOP nomination, is campaigning in part on standing up to the Biden administration and against federal overreach. She also outraised Miller during the first four and half months of the year.\n\nNew York lieutenant governor\n\nThere is very little power invested in the New York lieutenant governor’s office. Until, as has become typical in the state, the governor resigns in a cloud of scandal and his deputy takes over the big office.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul is the latest to make the jump, ascending after her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, resigned in disgrace last summer. Hochul seems like a safe bet to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and a full term in November, and has no (known) legal issues. But her first choice as lieutenant governor did – Brian Benjamin resigned as her second-in-command in April after being arrested on campaign finance fraud charges.\n\nHis departure opened up the field ahead of the Democratic primary. Hochul’s pick to replace him, now-former Rep. Antonio Delgado, has a good reputation in New York political circles and will be a formidable candidate in the primary. (In New York, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run in separate primaries but the winners then run on the same ticket in the general election.)\n\nDelgado’s main primary challenger is Ana María Archila, who would be the first Latina and LGBTQ candidate elected to statewide office and is running in tandem with gubernatorial hopeful Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate. Archila, a supporter of progressive politicians for years, has a strong following on the left.\n\nAlso in the Democratic race is former New York City Council Member Diana Reyna, the running mate of moderate US Rep. Tom Suozzi.\n\nFormer New York City police officer Alison Esposito is unopposed in the Republican primary.\n\nLos Angeles mayor\n\nCandidates for Los Angeles mayor debate on March 22, 2022. Myung J. Chun/AP\n\nDemocratic Rep. Karen Bass entered this year’s Los Angeles mayoral race as the candidate to beat as she vies to become the first woman and the first Black woman to lead America’s second-largest city. The former social worker and community organizer became known as a dealmaker during her years in the California State Assembly and was on Biden’s short list for his running mate.\n\nBut she is now locked in a tight race with shopping mall developer Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who had spent nearly $34 million on his campaign as of May 21 (most of which he loaned to his effort). With many voters angry about the city’s continuing crises with homelessness and worried about the rise in crime, Caruso, a former city police commissioner, has argued that career politicians have failed to solve the city’s problems and that now is the moment when Angelenos should elect an outsider.\n\nIf no one wins a majority of the vote in the June 7 all-party primary, the top two vote-getters – favored to be Bass and Caruso – would advance to the fall general election.\n\nSan Francisco district attorney recall\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, a former public defender elected in 2019, faces a recall vote in June over criticism that his progressive prosecutor model has made the city less safe.\n\nThe recall effort and subsequent campaign to remove Boudin has been spearheaded largely by outside groups led by Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, which also spent big in a recent school board recall election.\n\nWhether crime has, in fact, gotten worse in San Francisco during Boudin’s time in office is less certain. The available statistics show a mixed bag, but no apparent overall surge, and little to distinguish San Francisco from other major cities around the country.\n\nBut a number of high-profile, viral shoplifting incidents, rancor in Boudin’s office and a broader, national pushback against his style of law enforcement – which prioritizes rehabilitation over the “tough on crime” approach – have put Boudin’s fate in doubt.\n\nHarris County, Texas, county judge\n\nHome to Houston, Harris County is the third-largest county in the country, with a population of more than 4.7 million. Democrat Lina Hidalgo is running for a second term as county judge, a position akin to a county executive in other states.\n\nHildalgo, who was born in Colombia and emigrated with her family to the US as a teenager, emerged as a Democratic star four years ago when she unseated a three-term Republican at the age of 27 to become the first woman and first Latina to lead Harris County.\n\nArmy veteran Alexandra del Moral Mealer won the Republican nomination in a runoff to take on Hidalgo at a time when the incumbent’s campaign is reeling from several controversies. Three current or former Hildago aides were indicted in a vaccine contract scandal. Meanwhile, the Harris County election administrator, who was appointed by a board Hildalgo serves on, is resigning following a vote count mishap in the March primary.\n\nMany Democrats view Hidalgo as a future candidate for statewide office, but, first, she will need to overcome what is expected to be a strong GOP effort to unseat her this fall.\n\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court\n\nNorth Carolina is among several states that hold partisan elections for their highest court. And fall races for two state Supreme Court seats could shape North Carolina politics for years.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 4-3 edge on the bench, with two Democratic-held seats on the ballot this year.\n\nIn the legal battle over redistricting, the court’s Democratic majority blocked what it viewed as a Republican gerrymander of the state’s congressional map. A map approved by a state trial court offers more electoral opportunities for Democrats, but it’s only expected to be in place for this year’s elections.\n\nIf Republicans win control of the state Supreme Court and retain their majorities in the state legislature, the GOP will have the power to draw the 2024 map – Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, cannot veto redistricting bills under state law.\n\nDemocratic Justice Sam Ervin IV is seeking a second eight-year term against Republican Trey Allen, general counsel for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts. Two state appellate judges – Democrat Lucy Inman and Republican Richard Dietz – are facing off for the seat of retiring Democratic Justice Robin Hudson.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten Rachel Janfaza Gregory Krieg Dan Merica Kelly Mena Maeve Reston Steve Contorno Andrew Menezes", "Fredreka Schouten", "Rachel Janfaza", "Gregory Krieg", "Dan Merica", "Kelly Mena", "Maeve Reston", "Steve Contorno", "Andrew Menezes"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}]}

Selected over the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia, it will be the smallest nation ever to host the event, with a population of 2.8 million (and just over 330,000 citizens). Qatar’s team had never qualified for a World Cup, and the country had no discernible footballing tradition. It had no suitable stadiums either, which meant that eight venues had to be upgraded or built from scratch.\n\nThe tournament could not reasonably be played in the summer, when temperatures average around 40°C. So instead it will take place in the cooler months of November and December, disrupting most of the world’s domestic competitions. Qatar is also an absolute monarchy, with a poor human rights record; and it has often been criticised for exploitative labour practices and dangerous working conditions.\n\nSo how did it win?\n\nEver since 2010, accusations of corruption have swirled around the 2022 bidding process. It was alleged that the disgraced Fifa vice president Jack Warner and his family were paid $2m by a company linked to Qatar’s campaign. In 2014, The Sunday Times published a cache of documents it said were proof of Qatar’s plot to “buy the World Cup” – allegedly orchestrated by Mohamed bin Hammam, a former Fifa vice president and the country’s top football official. It is said that $5m (£3m) was paid to Fifa officials in return for their support. Bin Hammam and those accused of accepting bribes deny the charges, but broader anti-corruption investigations against Fifa followed; nearly 30 people have been convicted as a result of a US department of justice probe. Blatter and his former colleague Michel Platini were forced out of their jobs, and last month were indicted on fraud charges.\n\nWhat criticisms are made over working conditions?\n\nQatar relies heavily on migrant labourers, who make up 95% of its workers. Over the past decade, tens of thousands of workers, mostly from the Indian subcontinent, have built World Cup infrastructure ranging from stadiums to new hotels to transport systems. They were largely employed using the kafala or sponsorship system, under which visas are obtained by specific Qatari employers – meaning that, until recently, if workers wanted to change jobs, or even leave the country, they needed their employer’s permission. This system was ripe for abuse; at its worst, it has been described as akin to slavery. Amnesty International has detailed extensive maltreatment of foreign workers, including forced labour; salaries being underpaid; cramped and dirty accommodation; and workers being threatened if they complain. Working conditions are also reportedly often unsafe.\n\nUnsafe in what ways?\n\nEarlier this year, The Guardian compiled figures from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and found that more than 6,500 migrants from those countries had died in Qatar since 2010. In particular, there have been reports of labourers who worked for World Cup projects dying and suffering serious injury because of heatstroke after working in sweltering conditions. Studies have found increased rates of chronic kidney disease among Nepali migrant workers returned from Qatar, linked to working long hours in summer with insufficient drinking water. Some of these workers will now require dialysis several times a week for the rest of their lives.\n\nHow has the sport responded?\n\nSeveral countries have registered concerns over Qatar’s human rights record. The most vocal opposition has been in Norway, whose Football Federation held a vote on whether to boycott the event after a campaign by some of the country’s leading clubs and fan groups. It ultimately decided against the move; but Norway’s players have worn T-shirts bearing slogans such as “Human rights, on and off the pitch” ahead of qualifying games. Countries including Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have taken similar steps. England’s players have said they are discussing how to respond. Yet the condemnation has been by no means universal, and many appear ready to cash in on the tournament; David Beckham recently signed a £150m deal to be an ambassador for the tournament.\n\nWhat is Qatar’s position?\n\nIt denies that bribes were paid to secure votes for the right to host the tournament. Qatar also contests the high number of migrant labourer deaths; it says that there have been only 37 deaths among workers directly linked to construction of World Cup stadiums. Under pressure, in 2019 it reformed the kafala system, so that legally migrants can change jobs or leave the country without their employer’s permission; and it has introduced a minimum wage. The UN’s International Labour Organisation declared that these reforms mark “the beginning of a new era for the Qatari labour market”.\n\nWhat will the event’s legacy be?\n\nSepp Blatter has since described the decision to give Qatar the World Cup as a “mistake” – but it will go ahead even so; some $10bn has been spent on stadiums and nearly $300bn on related infrastructure. Fifa and Qatar insist that the tournament will leave a lasting social legacy. Critics argue this will be skin deep: that many employers ignore the new laws; and point out that though LGBT fans are in theory welcome, homosexuality remains illegal. Despite all the controversy, Qatar still stands to benefit, says Nicholas McGeehan of the human rights group FairSquare. “For every fan who is concerned about migrant workers and LGBT issues, there are probably another 40 or 50 people who are uncritically consuming PR content that presents Qatar as a luxurious destination with five-star hotels and camel rides.”\n\nThe transformation of Qatar\n\nA former British protectorate which gained independence in 1971, Qatar has been dominated by the Al Thani family since the mid 19th century. Like much of the region, it was changed profoundly by the discovery of oil, in 1939. Today it is the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas, and one of the richest countries per capita on Earth – home to an ever increasing number of gleaming skyscrapers, cultural attractions and global university outposts. It has sought to cultivate a reputation for openness: the TV network Al Jazeera, founded in Doha in 1996, has shaken up the Arab world by taking its leaders to task. The station, though, seldom criticises Qatar; in fact, criticism of the Qatari government is illegal.\n\nThe emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, holds all executive power. In October, however, Qataris elected 30 members of a consultative council for the first time. Only those whose families lived in Qatar before 1930 were allowed to vote. Qatari relations with other Gulf states have often been strained in recent years: the UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have accused it of supporting terrorism, notably the Muslim Brotherhood, and imposed a damaging trade embargo for three years.

The Dutch team plays Qatar in Group A on Nov. 29.\n\nFIFA rules prohibit teams from bringing their own armband designs to the World Cup and insist they must use equipment provided by the governing body.\n\nArmbands are the latest battleground for players to push political messages linked to the World Cup hosted in Qatar, where homosexual acts are illegal and the treatment of migrant workers building projects for the tournament has been a decade-long controversy.\n\n“Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching,” England captain Harry Kane said in a statement.\n\nThe Swiss soccer federation said it wanted captain Granit Xhaka to wear an armband on which “you can see a heart with diverse colors which represent the diversity of humanity.”\n\nSoccer players have embraced their platform to make statements in recent years. Taking a knee on the field was routine before Premier League games for two seasons after the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a police officer in the United States.\n\nFIFA supported taking a knee and now has to decide whether to back some of its most influential member federations in a gesture that could embarrass Qatar.\n\n“A request to FIFA has also been submitted asking that permission be provided for the armbands to be worn throughout the FIFA World Cup,” the Welsh soccer federation said in a statement.\n\nFIFA did not immediately comment on the request.\n\nEuropean soccer body UEFA said it “fully supports the OneLove campaign, which was initially developed by the (Dutch federation).”\n\nThe armbands will also be worn at UEFA-organized games in the Nations League this week, including by both captains when Belgium hosts Wales on Thursday.\n\nUEFA previously let Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer wear a rainbow captain's armband at European Championship games last year, including against tournament co-host Hungary where lawmakers passed anti-gay legislation during the tournament.\n\nThe campaign for armbands was launched one day after the Emir of Qatar spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York promising a World Cup without discrimination.\n\n“The Qatari people will receive with open arms football fans from all walks of life,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said in a speech to other world leaders.\n\nThe eight European teams backing the “OneLove” campaign for human rights also included Belgium and Denmark. The five European qualifiers for the World Cup not taking part Wednesday were Croatia, Poland, Portugal, Serbia and Spain.\n\nHowever, Poland captain Robert Lewandowski — a two-time FIFA world player of the year — said this week he would take an armband in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine’s flag to Qatar.\n\nPoland refused to play Russia, the 2018 World Cup host, in a playoff match in March. Before the game, FIFA and European soccer body UEFA banned Russian teams from international competitions because the country invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe campaign for the armbands emerged while a panel of UEFA member federations has monitored progress in Qatar on labor law reforms and other human rights ahead of the tournament.\n\nThat panel includes the Norwegian soccer federation, whose president Lise Klaveness delivered a scathing criticism of the Qatari project at an annual FIFA meeting in March in Doha on the eve of the tournament draw.\n\nEngland and Wales were among the federations Wednesday acknowledging progress made in Qatar since the wealthy emirate won the World Cup hosting vote in December 2010.\n\nHowever, the English federation said players would meet with some migrant workers who will be invited to its training camp in Al Wakrah.\n\nEngland also added to support already expressed in Germany this week for FIFA and World Cup organizers to compensate the families of construction workers who died or were injured after coming to Qatar to help build stadiums, metro lines and hotels.\n\nAmnesty International has suggested FIFA should pay $440 million in reparations to equal the prize money being paid to the 32 teams in Qatar.\n\nAt a German federation event on Monday, an invited fan who is gay used the platform to urge the Qatari ambassador that his country should abolish laws against homosexuality. The ambassador, Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, complained that human rights issues were distracting from the tournament.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}]}

The research could someday mean an end to long searches for compatible donors or dangerous transfusion reactions.\n\nThe experimental transfusion was done at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England, as part of a collaborative effort among UK scientists to understand how lab-made blood transfusions could work.\n\nThe scientists took whole blood from donors in a UK database and separated out the stem cells. These are the body’s raw materials – the cells from which all specialized cells, like a red blood cell, can generate.\n\nThe researchers grew red blood cells from those stem cells and transfused them into two healthy volunteers.\n\nThe transfusions involved only a tiny amount of blood: the equivalent of one or two teaspoons. A standard blood transfusion would involve many hundred times that amount.\n\nThis stage of the trial involves two mini transfusions at least four months apart, one with a standard donation of red cells and the other with lab-made cells from the same donor.\n\nThe researchers are closely monitoring the volunteers to determine whether the process was safe. They say there have been with “no untoward side effects” so far.\n\nThey’re also watching how long the lab-grown cells last compared with an infusion of standard red blood cells. Red blood cells typically last about 120 days, but a transfusion from a standard donation contains cells that are a variety of ages because the bone marrow continuously makes these cells.\n\nPrevious tests have shown that manufactured cells function like normal cells and that these lab-made cells are likely to survive longer overall while in circulation. This study will determine for the first time whether that’s true.\n\nFurther trials will be necessary to determine whether there could be a clinical use of this lab-grown product.\n\nThe research could eventually make a difference for people with sickle cell disease, those who develop antibodies against most donor blood types, or those with genetic disorders in which their body can’t make red blood cells or the blood cells they make don’t work well.\n\nRed blood cells are the helper cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues, which use this oxygen to produce energy. The process also generates waste in the form of carbon dioxide that the red blood cells take to the lungs to be exhaled out.\n\nWith sickle cell disease – also called sickle cell anemia – red blood cells take on a folded shape that can clog tiny blood vessels and cause organ damage and pain. People with sickle cell often need multiple transfusions over the course of their lives.\n\n“This world leading research lays the groundwork for the manufacture of red blood cells that can safely be used to transfuse people with disorders like sickle cell,” Dr. Farrukh Shah, a researcher on the study and medical director of transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said in a news release. “The need for normal blood donations to provide the vast majority of blood will remain. But the potential for this work to benefit hard to transfuse patients is very significant.”\n\nDr. Glenn Ramsey, medical director of the blood bank at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and a professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said he has had many patients over the years who are extremely difficult to transfuse and would have benefited from a therapy like the one in this study.\n\nOften, if there is not a local blood match, he has to turn to the American Rare Blood Donor Program – and even then won’t always find an appropriate donor. In one case a few Thanksgivings ago, it was so difficult to find a match for one patient that they had to turn to a world database and bring in blood from Canada.\n\n“This doesn’t come up very often, and it’s an extreme example, but this would be the kind of problem that these kinds of cells could try to solve,” said Ramsey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nHe found the work “quite exciting” and its potential enormous.\n\nScientists have been working on this issue for many years, he said.\n\n“Down the road in years to come, this might be a way to replace transfusions as we know it,” Ramsey said. “It’s still a long way from getting to that point, but it certainly starts us down the road to see if this will even be feasible.”\n\nDr. Cheryl Maier, an assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and a medical director at the Emory Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, said the experiment is a “really exciting advancement.”\n\nShe is particularly interested in the possibilities of lab-made red blood cell for people with sickle cell.\n\n“There hasn’t been a lot of attention on some of these diseases, especially sickle cell, which mostly affects African American patients, and it can be really frustrating and disheartening that there isn’t more attention to it,” said Maier, who wasn’t involved in this study.\n\n“For certain patients, especially patients with sickle cell disease or other patients that need some kind of chronic transfusion therapy, if you gave them incompatible blood, they would have oftentimes a very strong bad transfusion reaction,” she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe research could lay the groundwork for studies of things like platelets, which are often in critically short supply, she said. If scientists find that lab-made red blood cell products last longer, it may also improve the quality of life for people who wouldn’t have to be transfused as regularly.\n\n“Even in 2022, there are patients that we almost can’t find units for, and they get a delay in their treatment because we can’t find matching units for them,” Maier said. “I think it definitely has the ability to revolutionize how we support some patients that are really difficult to support with blood products currently.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/958450/the-science-behind-lab-grown-blood", "title": "The science behind lab-grown blood | The Week UK", "text": "Laboratory-grown red blood cells have been transfused into people in a world-first clinical trial.\n\nIn a development that “could significantly improve treatment for people with blood disorders and rare blood types”, small amounts of lab-grown red blood cells were tested to see how they perform inside the body, said CNBC.\n\nThe two people transfused with the lab-grown red cells were closely monitored and remain “well and healthy” and have suffered no side effects, said the University of Cambridge. This is the first time that red blood cells grown in a laboratory have been given to another person as part of a trial into blood transfusion.\n\nHow is blood grown in a lab?\n\nThe three-week process begins when scientists take a normal donation of a pint of blood and use magnetic beads to “fish out” flexible stem cells that are capable of becoming a red blood cell, said the BBC.\n\nThese stem cells were encouraged to grow in large numbers in the lab and are guided to become red blood cells. They were transfused in quantities of around 5-10ml – about one to two teaspoons – into the volunteers.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nThe aim of the trial is to manufacture vital, but ultra-rare, blood groups that are hard to get hold of. The University of Bristol’s Prof Ashley Toye said some blood groups were “really, really rare” and there “might only be 10 people in the country” able to donate these.\n\nHowever, if they were produced in bulk in labs, red blood cells can be “tuned to have whichever blood type is needed”, said New Atlas. This addresses the two challenges the blood donation system faces: that demand “far outstrips supply” and the “extra hassle” of “matching blood types”.\n\nTherefore, the development “could be an absolute game changer for increasing supplies of previously ultra-rare blood types”, agreed Popular Science, “and may even one day enable smaller and less frequent transfusions”.\n\nIf the manufactured cells prove to last longer in the body and patients require less transfusion, it would bring down the iron overload from frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to “serious complications”, said The Independent.\n\nWhat are the challenges?\n\nHarvested stem cells “eventually exhaust themselves”, said the BBC, which limits the amount of blood that can be grown. Therefore, “it will take more research to produce the volumes that would be needed clinically,” the broadcaster added.\n\nThen there is the question of cost. While the average blood donation costs the NHS around £130, growing blood will cost significantly more. However, a spokesperson from NHS Blood and Transplant told CNBC, “if the trial is successful and the research works, then it could be introduced at scale in future years, meaning that costs would fall”.\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nJohn James OBE, Chief Executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said the research “offers real hope for those difficult to transfuse sickle cell patients who have developed antibodies against most donor blood types” but added that “the NHS still needs 250 blood donations every day to treat people with sickle cell and the figure is rising”.\n\nDr Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, agreed that “the need for normal blood donations to provide the vast majority of blood will remain” but added that “the potential for this work to benefit hard-to-transfuse patients is very significant”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958479/quiz-of-the-week-5-11-november", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 5 – 11 November | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

We really need this,’\" Kopechek said.\n\nMenze and Kopechek, with the help of Janis, as well as various U of L students, have devised a process of preserving red blood cells though freezing and dehydration. The cells are turned into a powder that remains viable at a wider range of temperatures than donated blood, which has to be refrigerated.\n\nThey believe their approach could make donated red blood cells more easily stored and transported, in addition to allowing them to be stockpiled for longer periods of time.\n\nWhen someone donates blood, it is separated into different components, including plasma, platelets and red blood cells, said Dr. Dennis Williams, the Kentucky Blood Center's medical director.\n\nRegulations require red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body, to be used within 42 days. After that, they must be disposed of, although Williams said that doesn't happen often.\n\nWilliams suggested there could be benefits to using the freeze-dried red blood cells, although he said blood banks already have an efficient system of collecting, maintaining and transporting blood.\n\n\"If it became a standard way of processing and storing blood, it would definitely be helpful,\" he said. \"It's easier than having to have refrigerators that you're constantly monitoring.\"\n\nMenze, Kopechek and Janis said their freeze-drying process, if it proves to be effective once they test it in humans, could be a big help to the military, which often operates in extreme environments, making it even tougher to lug refrigerated cases of blood into the field.\n\nNASA also has taken an interest in their research, Menze said. The federal agency is providing $275,000 in funding so they can test the process of rehydrating the freeze-dried red blood cells during flights that simulate zero gravity.\n\nIn particular, he said, NASA could be interested in the possibility of using this lightweight form of red blood cells for long-distance spaceflight, which is itself theoretical at this point but could involve a risk of radiation-induced anemia for astronauts.\n\n\"Microgravity can impact new technologies in unexpected ways,” Stephan Ord, with NASA’s Flight Opportunities Program, said in an emailed statement. “NASA sponsors suborbital flight tests so researchers can refine and mature their technologies before proposing them for further development or even implementation into future missions.”\n\nHow freeze-dried blood works\n\nHere's the gist of how U of L’s researchers are turning red blood cells into a powder that's easily stored in bottles or bags and can be quickly rehydrated for transfusion.\n\nFirst, they mix red blood cells with a sugar called trehalose, which helps sea monkeys survive in dried-out environments and is also used for some vaccines and for food preservation, such as a certain kind of doughnut glaze.\n\n\"The biological clock literally stops. The moment you dry an animal out, it's (essentially) not aging anymore,\" Menze said. “So if we could do with blood what those animals can do in nature … we would be able to make blood way more accessible,” including bringing it to regions of the world that lack available refrigeration or electricity.\n\nAfter they combine the red blood cells and the trehalose, they put that mixture into a tube that flows through a device, which graduate student Emily Murphy helped develop, in which the red blood cells are exposed to ultrasound waves and gas microbubbles.\n\nThose waves and microbubbles essentially punch temporary holes in the red blood cells, opening a gateway through which the preservative sugars enter.\n\nNext, they freeze and then dehydrate the solution, eliminating any water and leaving behind only a powder that consists of the sugared-up red blood cells.\n\nWhen they're ready to actually use the blood, they add water (which must be sterile) to the powder and mix them together.\n\nAnd boom: They have liquid red blood cells again that are theoretically ready to be pumped into a patient. (Their team isn’t testing this on people yet.)\n\nMenze, an associate professor and assistant chairman of U of L’s biology department, and Kopechek, an assistant professor of bioengineering, didn't expect their research efforts to intersect.\n\nMenze studies animals that can live in extreme environments, such as sea monkeys, while Kopechek researches gene and drug delivery methods for treating illnesses such as cancer.\n\nHowever, Janis — the Ph.D. candidate who works with Menze — spotted an opportunity to unite the professors’ respective fields of work after he heard a presentation on Kopechek's efforts.\n\nNow, two years later, they're making steady progress. They recently began their first tests on live subjects — in this case, rats, all of which have survived so far.\n\nIf testing their method of freeze-drying, rehydrating and transfusing red blood cells works in rats, the next step would be testing on larger animals such as pigs, Menze said. The phase after that would be clinical trials on humans, which could begin within the next three to five years.\n\nTheir approach to storing red blood cells ultimately would have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before it could be widely used for patients.\n\nHelping trauma patients\n\nDr. Dave Duncan, who serves as the EMS medical director for CAL FIRE, one of the world's largest fire departments, and also works for two air ambulance companies, said this approach to blood storage could save the lives of trauma patients, who face a significant risk of dying from rapid blood loss.\n\n\"Our brain dies early and rapidly as oxygen delivery falls off. And at the end of the day, loss of blood and drop in blood pressure means we're delivering less oxygen to tissues,\" he said. \"Everything we do in trauma is centered around delivering oxygen to cells that are about to die, and red blood cells are the answer, or 'the antidote.'\"\n\nDuncan, who has provided input for U of L's research efforts, said the work Menze, Kopechek and their students are doing with freeze-dried blood \"offers the biggest potential tool\" to reducing the number of preventable deaths that occur while emergency responders are helping and transporting trauma patients.\n\n\"Red blood cells are a little like a time machine,\" Duncan explained. \"If somebody's bleeding and we can add more red blood cells, we buy more time — and that might be enough time to get them to the operating room or to the emergency room.\"\n\nYou may like:University of Louisville stands to make nearly $45M on Passport sale\n\nRegulatory restrictions are the biggest impediment for emergency responders seeking to bring blood out into the field, he said, although the limited space available on both ground and air ambulances presents another formidable challenge.\n\nHe believes the freeze-drying approach could help overcome those issues, especially if the processed powder is treated more like a pharmaceutical and handled by companies rather than blood banks or hospitals.\n\nEduardo Nunes, vice president of quality systems, standards and accreditation for AABB, a nonprofit association that develops standards and provides accreditation for most U.S. blood banks, said there's nothing quite like what U of L's researchers are working on, which he called \"novel\" and \"innovative.\"\n\n\"In general, I think there are a lot of pressures on the blood supply. This is a product with a limited shelf life,\" he said. \"Anything that alleviates the pressure on the inventory is definitely appealing.\"\n\nIn terms of blood shortages, Nunes said there is a nationwide network of organizations that ensures blood gets to where patients need it, even when unexpected mass casualty events like the 2016 Pulse nightclub or 2019 Virginia Beach shootings happen.\n\nThere can be regional variations in blood availability, though, and elective surgeries may be postponed at times because of low supply, he said. But blood banks and hospitals across the country are consistently able to meet critically injured patients' needs.\n\nAs for the freeze-dried cells U of L researchers are working on, Nunes said it's hard to say at this point how that might be implemented because blood is subject to a lot of regulations, federal and otherwise.\n\n\"But when something comes along that has the potential to benefit patients ... (it's) incumbent on anyone with oversight to really understand how to make the best use of that,\" he said.\n\nMilitary applications\n\nLt. Col. Torree McGowan of the Oregon Air National Guard has been deployed for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSoldiers have a better chance of surviving a critical injury on the battlefield in Afghanistan than they do in some more remote parts of the U.S., she said, because the military has developed an effective evacuation system that rapidly shuttles its members to the closest surgeon.\n\nHowever, America is involved in military operations in more than 150 countries, which don’t all have the kind of infrastructure the armed forces have developed over the years in Afghanistan. And members of the military who are injured and hemorrhaging, whether from a gunshot or a car crash, have a higher chance of survival if they can get access to new blood quickly.\n\nRead this:Want to get free IT training? This U of L program is open for applications\n\nThe military operates in extremely hot and cold environments, and bringing donated blood into a combat situation is “nearly impossible” because it must be continuously refrigerated and has a narrow temperature range that must be maintained in order for it to remain viable, McGowan said.\n\n\"If it’s something that’s small enough and portable enough that they could bring it with them, this absolutely could save (soldiers') lives,” she said of U of L’s research, especially in areas with limited access to medical personnel and resources.\n\nBut McGowan sees this as a potentially vital tool not only for people who serve their country but also for civilians, noting that much of America is made up of rural areas that are hours away from the nearest trauma center.\n\n“This could save lives back home as well,” she emphasized.\n\nThere’s still a lot of research and testing to be done before freeze-dried red blood cells could become part of the military’s strategy for treating critical injuries or before it becomes a tool used stateside by emergency responders.\n\nRegardless of whether the cells are being refrigerated or freeze-dried, there’s a continual need for people to donate their blood to ensure enough is available for patients when they need it, said Martha Osborne of the Kentucky Blood Center.\n\n“That’s why it’s so important for people to give regularly,” she said. “There’s still nothing that substitutes for a volunteer coming in and donating blood.”\n\nMorgan Watkins: 502-582-4502; mwatkins@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @morganwatkins26.

It comes in pill form.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has authorized Paxlovid for emergency use in people ages 12 and up who weigh at least 88 pounds and who have mild to moderate Covid-19 but are at high risk for severe disease.\n\nThe standard regimen is three pills twice daily for five days.\n\nBiden’s risk for severe disease\n\nBiden’s age – 79 – puts him at risk for severe Covid-19. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says older adults who are fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduce their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nBiden is double-boosted. He got his initial vaccination series before his inauguration in January 2021. He got his first booster in September and his second booster March 30.\n\nBiden’s symptoms are mild. He has a runny nose, an occasional cough and some fatigue.\n\nThe President’s doctor, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a letter Friday that Biden had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on Thursday evening. He took Tylenol, and his temperature has remained normal since.\n\nBecause Paxlovid can interact with other medications, O’Connor temporarily took Biden off Crestor and Eliquis, two heart medications he takes for his pre-existing conditions. Doctors say there is no short-term risk to stopping these drugs.\n\nHow does Paxlovid work?\n\nPaxlovid suppresses the coronavirus, blocking an enzyme that helps the virus reproduce inside the body.\n\nAs with all antivirals, the treatment is thought to work best if people start taking it within five days of their first symptoms.\n\nHow successful is it?\n\nClinical trials of Paxlovid showed that it reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88% when given within five days of the start of symptoms.\n\nHowever, the drug was tested in unvaccinated people during the Delta variant surge, so the results could look different for people who take the pills now, with the Omicron variant dominant.\n\nPfizer has said the drug works well against Omicron, and additional lab studies have shown similar results.\n\n“Joe Biden is vaccinated and twice boosted, that in and of itself decreases his risk of severe disease, hospitalization or death,” Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and academic dean of public health at Brown University, said Thursday. “You add on to it Paxlovid, which reduces – even in vaccinated people – that risk of hospitalization by another 80% to 90%, and the chance of anything bad happening to him is virtually zero.”\n\nWhat about side effects?\n\nPaxlovid’s side effects are considered mild and could include diarrhea, increased blood pressure, muscle aches, stomach pain, nausea and an altered sense of taste.\n\nAllergic reactions include hives, trouble swallowing or breathing, swelling of the mouth, throat tightness, hoarseness and rash. Liver problems are also possible.\n\nDoctors say the medication is usually well-tolerated.\n\nWhat about a rebound?\n\n“There have been people who have had Paxlovid relapse. That is, although Paxlovid suppresses [symptoms] for a period of time while you’re taking it, five days, after that, some people get a recurrence of some of their symptoms. So we’ll just have to watch that,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said Thursday.\n\nIn May, the CDC issued a health advisory to let doctors know about the potential for recurrence of Covid-19 with Paxlovid, but the agency continues to recommend using it.\n\nRebound cases have been reported between two and eight days after initial recovery. Most people who had new symptoms said they resolved in about three days, even without additional treatment.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that when he got Covid-19, he took a five-day course of Paxlovid and was feeling better but had a rebound with worse symptoms. He went back on the drug and recovered.\n\nRanney and other doctors say they don’t like to think of it as a rebound infection. Rather, Paxlovid does a good job of suppressing the virus and preventing the damage it can do, but it’s possible that the virus is not fully eliminated from the body and re-emerges.\n\nSome scientists think that some people metabolize Paxlovid more quickly than others and that they may need a longer course of treatment. Research is still underway.\n\n“We’re not seeing folks who end up with those symptoms with a need for hospitalization after taking Paxlovid, so the term ‘rebound’ I don’t like because it scares people away from taking Paxlovid,” Ranney said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC says it doesn’t think that a return of symptoms is a sign of reinfection or a development of resistance to Paxlovid. The number of people who rebound is nominal, early research shows.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha downplayed concerns over the potential that Biden might rebound while taking Paxlovid.\n\n“The best clinical data we have suggests it happens about 5%, 7% of the time,” Jha said Friday. “It’s pretty infrequent, and the good news is, even when that happens, people end up doing just fine.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/health/xylazine-tranq-overdose/index.html", "title": "How xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, is making overdoses even ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the country lost 105,752 lives to drug overdoses in the 12-month period ending October 2021. And while most of those overdoses involved the illicit synthetic opioid fentanyl, experts say that an adulterated and contaminated drug supply is also leading to deaths.\n\nAmong the most concerning changes in the illicit drug market has been the appearance of xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer also commonly known as “tranq” or “tranq dope,” said Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you look at each individual death record, when you look at the actual files and the actual chemical analysis, you see other peaks in there … which are definitely not fentanyl and are these other contaminants that are in the drug supply,” explained Dasgupta, who has been studying drug use and infectious diseases for over two decades.\n\nAccording to the CDC, about half of drug overdose deaths involved multiple drugs in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available.\n\nBut detecting what drugs were involved in an overdose isn’t always easy. One study of drug samples collected in Vermont and Kentucky found multiple active components in at least 89% of drugs sold as opioids or cocaine.\n\nAnalysis of drugs seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration at or near the southwest border has found drugs to contain just 5% to 10% of what they claim and often include adulterants or cutting agents like acetaminophen, benzocaine and xylazine.\n\n‘Tranq dope’\n\nXylazine is not approved for human use. It has heavy sedative effects like an opioid, but it isn’t an opioid, and it doesn’t respond to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone.\n\n“Some very eagle-eyed street chemists in Philadelphia picked up on this early. Connecticut has released reports on it; we see it in Michigan, all around the country, even in Canada,” Dasgupta said.\n\nA study of overdose death records in Philadelphia between 2010 and 2015 traced xylazine in 2% of opioid-related overdose deaths. By 2019, research found xylazine involved in 1 in 3 opioid-related fatal overdoses in the city.\n\nA study published this month in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence found that in 10 places across the country, xylazine was involved in just 0.36% of overdose deaths in 2015. But by 2020, the drug was linked to 6.7% of overdose deaths, with the highest percentages in Philadelphia, Maryland and Connecticut. In 98% of all xylazine-related deaths in the study, fentanyl was also used.\n\nFentanyl is fast-acting opioid, and users say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of that high, said Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles and co-author of the recent paper.\n\nRise of synthetic drugs\n\nXylazine is just one of the many adulterants found in the illicit drug supply that has shifted from heroin, a natural opioid derived from poppy plants, to lab-made synthetics such as fentanyl.\n\n“All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,” Friedman said. “People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they’re buying and what they’re consuming.”\n\nSome of these adulterants or additives may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners that are added for taste, or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may just be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process. But all of these things can carry real-life health harms, Dasgupta said.\n\nLike an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it’s combined with heroin or fentanyl.\n\nAlso, “in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that’s contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,” Dasgupta said. “We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine.”\n\nThe drug is also associated with skin and soft tissue wound infections.\n\nFollowing in fentanyl’s footsteps\n\nIt’s difficult to determine just how prevalent xylazine is in the drug supply or in typical use.\n\nOne analysis from the CDC found that just 1.2% of deaths were attributed to xylazine in 23 states in 2019. But the report also notes that it may be an undercount because testing for xylazine is not standard.\n\n“We don’t have enough of a robust drug checking system to know reliably how far it’s penetrated and in what areas,” said Maya Doe-Simkins, co-founder of Harm Reduction Michigan.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThis leaves a more dangerous and threatening drug landscape for users to navigate.\n\nSome are able to check their drugs with infrared or mass spectrometry, tools traditionally used by forensic teams that are now being adopted by harm-reduction groups to test drugs. Other users are having to learn via word of mouth.\n\nPublic health experts worry about a brewing crisis.\n\n“It seems like xylazine is following fentanyl’s footsteps,” Friedman said. “Just like fentanyl did 10 years earlier, everywhere it lands, it’s growing exponentially.”\n\nBut he hopes what happened over the past decade can inform the response now.\n\n“This time 10 years ago, there was a missed opportunity to effectively respond to fentanyl. And hopefully we can do a better job this time around.”", "authors": ["Nadia Kounang"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/27/fort-collins-blood-cancer-leukemia-bone-marrow-transplant/1379659002/", "title": "Be The Match: Fort Collins girl's blood cancer treatment helps save ...", "text": "To the delight of doctors and cancer patients around the world, Laura Graves enjoyed Disneyland in January 1981 as a healthy 12-year-old girl.\n\nA little more than a year earlier, the Fort Collins native had become the first person to receive a bone marrow transplant from a nonrelated donor — a medical breakthrough that would result in a Nobel Prize for Medicine and ultimately change the way blood cancers are treated.\n\n“It was uplifting to meet her and to know I had participated in a greater miracle,” said her donor, Frances Otto-Depner, who met Laura the day after the procedure and joined the Graves family at Disneyland.\n\n“We are part of a tree of life that continues to branch out.”\n\nLaura had previously beaten leukemia, but the prognosis was grim when it relapsed in the fall of 1978. Her parents, Bob and Sherry Graves — the family behind Bellvue's Morning Fresh Dairy — wrestled for weeks with the Hail Mary medical option that in theory would replace her immune system with a healthy one.\n\nDoctors had referred to the research treatment bluntly as an “experiment” and weren’t sure if Laura’s body would reject the transplant.\n\n“We decided we had to give her this chance,\" said Sherry, now 82. \"Otherwise it was just a matter of time until she would die.”\n\nYou could be a bone marrow donor:Here's what you need to know\n\nLaura would briefly return to a normal life. But despite the success of the transplant, her leukemia relapsed again and Laura died of pneumonia on Aug. 15, 1981 — exactly five years after she was first diagnosed with cancer. If she were still alive, she would turn 50 this October.\n\nBone marrow transplants from nonrelatives are now a common treatment for blood cancers and have high survival rates. For Laura’s exact leukemia type, 75 percent of transplant recipients survive a year after the transplant and about 54 percent are alive three years later, according to U.S. Department Health and Human Services data.\n\nA national donor registry Bob started before he died now has a database of 19 million people. The organization, called Be The Match, facilitated more than 6,000 transplants in 2017.\n\n“Today we can find a donor in the vast majority of cases, and that really is Laura’s legacy,” said Dr. Fred Appelbaum, who was a student at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center when the original transplant was conducted.\n\nBefore she was diagnosed with leukemia in 1976, Laura was the healthiest of the four Graves children.\n\nThe second-oldest of the siblings, Laura was active in Brownies, Girl Scouts and 4-H. She took piano lessons and was obsessed with playing card and board games. She loved cooking — her cardamom bread once won a blue ribbon at the Larimer County Fair.\n\nThe Graves family had moved from their Bellvue dairy into a nearby Fort Collins neighborhood when Laura was young.\n\n“She was friendly and sweet,” recalled 52-year-old Rob Graves, Laura’s older brother by two years. “My daughter Amber is like Laura — empathetic, nice and cares about other people.”\n\nLaura remained upbeat throughout the five years she battled cancer.\n\nHer good health began to turn in the middle of 1976, when she became ill frequently, suffered aches and became too weak to lift her arms. An orthopedic specialist prescribed antibiotics.\n\nAfter a family friend pointed out lumps behind Laura’s ears, she was taken to an examination at Denver’s Children’s Hospital and diagnosed with leukemia — for the first of what would be three times — on Aug. 15, 1976.\n\n“We were told if we did nothing she would be dead in three months,” Sherry said.\n\nFor the next two years, Laura underwent conventional chemotherapy and radiation treatment. She started treatment as a third-grader and lost her hair five times — she wore bandannas and refused to completely remove them, even for doctors.\n\n“There were definitely good and bad days,” said her youngest sister, Christine Houldsworth, now 46. “Mom and Dad tried to make things as normal as possible. This was just our norm.”\n\nThe Graveses were hopeful when Laura's leukemia went into remission, but the cure wouldn't last long.\n\nThe cancer returned in 1978. This time, doctors offered few treatment options.\n\n“They told us nobody ever relapsed and lived,” Sherry said.\n\n'NOT READY TO QUIT':Fort Collins woman needs a 5-organ transplant\n\nThe Graves family was running out of options.\n\nTheir pediatrician Richard Booth had informed them of a new type of treatment where siblings could donate bone marrow to each other.\n\nBut they needed someone to match Laura’s HLA type — a protein that the immune system uses to recognize good and bad cells in the body. There are thousands of HLA types, but some, like Laura’s, are more common than others.\n\nHer siblings Rob, Sarah and Christine were all tested. While Rob and Christine were perfect matches for each other, no one matched Laura. Bob and Sherry were tested after reading about potential parent donors in a newspaper article, but neither was a match.\n\nAs hope faded, Dr. John Hansen stopped Bob in the hallway of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center with the radical proposition of testing out a donor who wasn’t related. Genetics were an important part of the procedure's success, but in theory, the transplant would work if a donor's HLA type was identical even if they weren't directly related to Laura.\n\nFor Bob, a college-trained veterinarian, the option was worth investigating, although he initially kept it a secret from Sherry so she wouldn’t worry.\n\nAn identical match was found in May 1979 with Otto-Depner, then a 26-year-old Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center clinical laboratory scientist. She had occasionally donated platelets and blood to patients.\n\nWith a chance for success, Bob finally told Sherry about the new bone marrow donation option. The couple contacted doctors around the country to see if they should be part of the new experiment. They received few words of encouragement.\n\n“We had no idea if this would cause a painful death,” Sherry said. “It was so new they just couldn’t imagine what could happen.”\n\nBy the time of the Sept. 4, 1979, transplant procedure, the newlywed Otto-Depner was no longer working at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and had relocated to San Diego with her husband, John. But she was inspired to keep her commitment and flew back to donate.\n\n“The Graveses are heroes in my eyes,” Otto-Depner said. “They had a very difficult decision to make. They loved their daughter very much and they didn’t know what they would create for her. But they were doing everything they could to keep her alive.”\n\nWhile the vast majority of bone marrow donations have gone without incident, Otto-Depner still feels the pain from hers.\n\nMORE:Woman gives bone marrow, asks 3-year-old Ventura recipient to be flower girl\n\nMedical students at the connected Swedish Hospital across the street conducted the procedure and made major mistakes that left her with more 200 puncture sites on her hip and tissue bleeding that required a transfusion of two units of blood.\n\nOtto-Depner needed three months to rehab before she could travel back to her husband and has suffered from nerve damage ever since — details the mother of two girls long has kept to herself — she didn't want to discourage future bone marrow donations or be a burden to the Graves family.\n\n“It has been worth the sacrifice,” said Otto-Depner, who has stayed in touch with the Graves family.\n\nSherry has retold Laura’s transplant story so many times, she’s now numb to most of the emotion behind it. Still, there’s one memory that brings her to tears.\n\nBefore the procedure, a social worker talked with Laura about her own mortality. The 10-year-old's response to learning that she might die?\n\n“Just don’t tell my mommy.”\n\n“She didn’t want me to worry,” Sherry said. “She was always so thoughtful and considerate.”\n\nFor all of the preoperative anxiety and mistakes made in Otto-Depner’s donation, Laura’s portion of the procedure went relatively smoothly. The transfusion was done through an IV, same as it is today.\n\nFollowing the transplant, Laura was confined to a germ-free laminar air flow room — aka a bubble — for 90 days while her new immune system formed. While Laura was dressed normally, any visitors had to wear full protective bodysuits. All materials that entered the room had to be radiated.\n\nLaura couldn’t eat regular foods while in the room but instead got medicine and nutrients through an IV in her chest.\n\nSherry stayed in Seattle to be with Laura. Bob and the rest of the children flew out twice — to be together on Laura's Oct. 7 birthday and on Thanksgiving.\n\nLaura would prank visitors by wearing a Halloween monster mask. She also passed the time by reading and playing canasta. The family flew out her Fort Collins teacher Wanda Koch so she wouldn’t fall behind in school.\n\nJohn Travolta, Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and the Seattle Seahawks sent her autographs. Family, friends and classmates sent games, cards and stuffed animals.\n\n“The community back home was always so supportive and behind us,” Sherry said.\n\nMORE: Fort Collins salon goes extra mile for cancer patients\n\nAfter 90 days in the bubble and 110 total days in Seattle, Laura was discharged. She returned home to Fort Collins in December 1979.\n\n“It was very celebratory,” Rob said. “At that point the transplant worked. Everyone thought it was done and a success.”\n\nWhen Laura returned home, everyone at the house wore face masks around her as a precaution. She rejoined her sixth-grade class in March 1980 and started seventh grade the following year at Lesher Junior High School.\n\nBut the return to normal didn't last long. Laura's leukemia resurfaced after the January 1981 Disneyland trip.\n\nNever willing to give up, the family consulted various doctors across the country and even flew to London in July 1981 to speak with a well-regarded expert. To their dismay, they were advised against a second bone marrow transplant as the radiation would be too hard on Laura’s soft tissues.\n\nOn the flight home, Laura got a nosebleed that wouldn’t stop. She was rushed to the hospital upon landing in Denver and received platelets. She received a platelet transfusion every three days thereafter, often from neighbors and Bob — who was forced stop because he was donating too frequently.\n\n“Laura had hope till the minute she died that her daddy was going to figure something out,” Sherry said.\n\nA month later, Laura died peacefully in her sleep on Aug. 15, 1981, in her parent’s king-size bed where she often stayed when she was sick. Her last words, aided by morphine medicine and an oxygen tank, were: “Nothing is working, let’s try chicken soup.”\n\nSherry has always wanted to write a book with those last words as the title.\n\n“I think the transplant gave her another year and half of life,” Sherry said. “I want her story to give hope.”\n\nLaura is buried in Fort Collins’ Grandview Cemetery with a headstone that reads: “Our Precious Daughter.” Sherry is planning to buried beside her, while Bob was previously cremated.\n\n\"We knew in our hearts we did everything there was to do to save our little girl,\" Sherry said.\n\nAbout a decade after Laura passed, her Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center doctor Donnall Thomas was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in advancing bone marrow transplants. He invited Bob and Sherry to the Stockholm, Sweden, ceremony as two of his 10 allotted guests.\n\nLaura's greatest legacy started months before she died.\n\nWithin a year of Laura's successful transplant, frantic parents in similar situations began calling the Graveses for advice. Often Sherry would take down all of the information and Bob would call back with tips on where to find HLA type matches at blood banks across the country.\n\nAs helpful as the Graveses were, many of the patients they tried to help died before they could get the transplant.\n\n“That’s when Bob realized the need for a registry where people can sign up ahead of time instead of trying to find people after they were diagnosed,” Sherry said. “It had to be quick.”\n\nBob incorporated Be The Match's precursor — The Laura Graves National Bone Marrow Foundation — in March 1981, with Laura at the initial meeting.\n\nDr. Thomas and other medical professionals from across the country joined the effort. The St. Paul American Red Cross Blood Center and the Council of Community Blood Centers were also instrumental in launching the registry.\n\nSignificant seed funding came from the U.S. Navy. Former chief of naval operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt — whose son died of Hodgkin's disease that was linked to the use of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War — was part of the organization's original board of directors.\n\nMORE:Bone marrow registry launches new social media campaign\n\nKnown for his untrimmed unibrow, Bob is remembered by his family as being a wise entrepreneur with a strong personality.\n\n“There was never two people side-by-side with more dominating eyebrows and commanding personal presences than Admiral Zumwalt and Bob Graves,” Sherry joked.\n\nBob also met with the U.S. Senate appropriations committee, where he found generous support from various representatives from both sided of the aisle.\n\nThe operation was renamed as the National Marrow Donor Program when it formally launched in 1987 with 2.8 million people on the registry.\n\nToday, the program is called Be The Match and includes more than 19 million people from around the world. The organization has facilitated more than 86,000 transplants since its inception. About 70 percent of patients require a non-related donor for the procedure.\n\nAn average 41,000 potential donors join the registry every month. In 2017, about 493,000 people joined in the U.S. alone.\n\nBe The Match now flies around the world to collect and facilitate bone marrow transplants.\n\n“It all spurred out of a father’s love for his daughter,” said Joy King, foundation director of Be The Match. “With no social media 30 years ago, it took a lot of hard work at the grassroots level to get this started.

Bone marrow in the human body is responsible for making more than 200 billion blood cells daily, producing platelets and red and white blood cells. Blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma stop bone marrow from functioning properly. But when diseased bone marrow is replaced, the new bone marrow should work properly for the patient’s body and begin rejecting cancerous cells. Patients are prepped for the transfusion with high doses of chemotherapy. Bone marrow stem cells are collected from donors and given to patients through an IV.\n\nSources: Be The Match, Dr. Fred Applebaum of Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and Dr. Steven Schuster of Fort Collins’ UCHealth Cancer Center.\n\nThose ages 18-44 are eligible to join the Be The Match bone marrow donor registry.

We didn't realize the Spike Protein is a TOXIN,'\" the text says. \"Does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own Spike Protein Toxins in their own bodies?\"\n\nThe post is one of dozens of similar claims that have circulated on Facebook and Instagram over the past few weeks, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. The most widely shared version stemmed from a May 31 article by LifeSite News, which has previously made false claims about the safety of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nThe Instagram photo is a screenshot of a May 31 headline from the Hal Turner Radio Show. Turner, a far-right radio host, has previously published false claims about coronavirus vaccines on his website.\n\nThe spike protein is located on the surface of the coronavirus and is used by the virus to enter human cells. All three coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use in the United States teach the body how to make antibodies against the spike proteins, eliciting an immune response.\n\nFact check:Moderna executive did not say mRNA vaccines alter recipient's DNA\n\nThe \"doctor\" the Hal Turner Radio Show and other websites cited is Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and an associate professor in the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. In a May 27 interview with Canadian broadcaster Alex Pierson cited in the Hal Turner Radio Show story, Bridle cast doubt on the safety of coronavirus vaccines by saying spike proteins are toxins that cause cardiovascular damage in vaccinated people.\n\n\"We made a big mistake,\" he said. \"We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. In some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens in some people it can cause damage — especially in the cardiovascular system.\"\n\nBridle said his claims were \"completely backed up by peer-reviewed, scientific publications.\"\n\nBut they're not.\n\nAn author of the study Bridle cited during the interview said Bridle \"over-interpreted\" its results. And several of Bridle's colleagues told USA TODAY his claims about spike proteins are wrong.\n\nPublic health officials say the coronavirus vaccines, which millions of Americans have received, are safe and effective at preventing severe COVID-19 cases.\n\nFact check:Peer-reviewed studies have shown safety, efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines\n\n\"Bridle is suggesting that a study that noted minuscule quantities of spike protein in blood after first dose represent a health hazard,\" David Fisman, an epidemiology professor at the University of Toronto, said in an email. \"That is poppycock: biologically implausible and not data-based.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Instagram user who shared the post for comment.\n\nVaccines teach body to make spike proteins\n\nFirst, let's review how the coronavirus vaccines work.\n\nTwo vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S., one from Pfizer-BioNTech and another from Moderna, use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to inoculate people against the coronavirus.\n\nMore traditional vaccines contain weakened or inactivated viruses, that aren't capable of causing infection or disease themselves, to build up the body's immune response.\n\nmRNA vaccines don't work like that. Instead, they carry genetic material with instructions that tell cells how to produce a protein or a piece of protein, which in turn activates the body's immune response and causes the production of antibodies.\n\nAll three vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. teach cells how to create the spike protein present on the surface of the coronavirus. The body then produces antibodies until all the spike proteins are destroyed, building up immunity for future coronavirus infections.\n\nCarolyn Coyne, a professor of molecular genetics and biology at Duke University, previously told USA TODAY that spike proteins do stay in the body for some time. But the proteins are eventually broken down, and the vaccines are constructed in a way that limits the ability of the proteins to fully bind to cells and create more infectious particles.\n\n\"There is no scientific data to indicate that the spike protein is toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination,\" Abby Capobianco, press officer for the FDA, said in an email.\n\nFact check:No, the CDC did not release data showing 7 in 10 Americans are declining COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThe coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious coronavirus infections, according to data from clinical trials involving more than 100,000 participants. Officials briefly paused use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in April after some people who received it developed a rare and serious kind of blood clot. But the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that vaccine's \"known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.\"\n\nStudy author, Pfizer refute claims\n\nDuring his interview with Pierson, Bridle cited two things: a study accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Infectious Diseases and a document about Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.\n\nBut neither source backs up his claims.\n\nBridle said the May 20 study showed how spike proteins produced by coronavirus vaccines could linger in the bloodstream and cause cardiovascular damage. An author of that study says otherwise.\n\n\"My reading of the article you sent is Bridle is over-interpreting our results,\" David Walt, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the study's co-author, said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nThe study measured proteins in plasma samples from 13 participants who received two doses of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine. It found that spike protein \"was detectable in three of 13 participants an average of 15 days after the first injection.\"\n\nBut those results don't indicate the coronavirus vaccines are dangerous. It suggests the vaccines are working as designed.\n\n\"Our study simply validated that the mRNA vaccine is translated into the protein it is designed to encode,\" Walt said. \"Because our method is 100-1000 fold more sensitive than others, we detected VERY low concentrations of the protein in most vaccinated individuals.\"\n\nThe paper's authors hypothesized that could be due to the body's immune response. During that process, T cells kill other cells that present the spike protein, causing an \"additional release of spike into the bloodstream.\"\n\nThat phenomenon isn't a cause for concern, Walt said.\n\n\"While it is true that the spike protein has 'superantigen' properties, which means it has the POTENTIAL to cause adverse effects, we know that it doesn’t cause these effects in many infected patients, it doesn’t cause many of these superantigen effects in most vaccinated individuals, and the levels are incredibly low in the blood, suggesting this shouldn’t be a concern,\" he said.\n\nFact check:No, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will not make your body Bluetooth connectable\n\nThe second source Bridle cited during his interview is a \"biodistribution study\" obtained from the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. He said the study shows how the coronavirus spike protein circulates in the bloodstream of vaccinated individuals and accumulates in their organs.\n\nPfizer told USA TODAY the document, which is in Japanese, doesn't back up Bridle's claims.\n\n\"The document is a real (common technical document), though it’s not leaked – it’s part of the submission data applied by Pfizer to PMDA (Japan’s version of FDA) for its review,\" Kit Longley, senior manager of science media relations, said in an email. \"The document is about the pharmacokinetics overview seen from lab studies and we can confirm it’s not about spike proteins from the vaccine resulting in dangerous toxins that linger in the body.\"\n\nColleagues say Bridle is off base\n\nWhen USA TODAY reached out to Bridle via email for comment, an automatic reply addressing his comments on the coronavirus vaccines was returned.\n\n\"My answer to the question posed by the host was objective and founded on multiple reliable scientific sources,\" Bridle's automatic reply says. \"I was simply fulfilling my duty as an academic public servant to disseminate information when it is asked of me.\"\n\nTurner also defended Bridle's claims in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n\"The video contained in the article on my website says all that needed to be said,\" Turner said. \"In it, you heard the doctor in his own words.\"\n\nBut Bridle's own colleagues at the University of Guelph's Ontario Veterinary College say the immunologist's claims are wrong.\n\n\"The bottom line is the vaccine contains an altered protein that is designed to prevent full activation, and it circulates for a short period of time at levels that are far below what would be a concern,\" W. Glen Pyle, a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences, said in an email.\n\nJ. Scott Weese, an associate professor in the Department of Pathobiology, said in an email that all evidence suggests the coronavirus vaccines are safe. Misinformation about the safety of the vaccines appears to be aimed at \"creating fear and confusion during a critical time in this pandemic,\" he said.\n\n\"The efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines is astounding, to me, particularly for a virus we’ve only known for a year and a half,\" Weese said. \"mRNA vaccines have been used on millions of people, including extremely high rates of vaccination in high-risk populations (elderly, patients with other diseases), with incredibly low adverse event rates.\"\n\nFact check:No, COVID-19 vaccine isn't transmitted to others via contact\n\nPublic health officials have closely monitored the vaccine rollout for potential adverse effects. Amy Greer, an associate professor in the Department of Population Medicine at the University of Guelph's Ontario Veterinary College, said in an email that the system appears to be working.\n\n\"Given the large number of mRNA vaccines administered to date, the absence of (safety concerns) with the mRNA vaccines is really a significant scientific achievement,\" she said.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that spike proteins from coronavirus vaccines are dangerous toxins that cause damage in the body is FALSE, based on our research. A recent study found spike protein in the blood of individuals vaccinated against COVID-19, but the levels were too low to cause damage, according to one of the study's authors. Pfizer and Bridle's colleagues also say his claims about spike proteins are wrong. Public health officials say the three coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are safe and effective at preventing serious infection.\n\nFact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Semen samples were taken before the first vaccine dose and approximately 70 days after the second, which is about how long sperm takes to regenerate.\n\nScientists analyzed semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and total sperm count and found no significant decrease in any of these parameters compared with the samples taken before the COVID-19 shots.\n\n“It was an unknown area that was making guys nervous to get the vaccine,” said study co-author Jesse Ory, urology fellow in infertility/andrology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nUS deaths dip below 300 per day as pandemic's grip eases\n\nCOVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020.

The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Periodic, localized blood shortages are not uncommon, but this shortage is “unprecedented in its scope,” said Dr. Claudia Cohn, chief medical officer for the American Association of Blood Banks. Officials point toward a number of factors including the typical summer drop in blood donations at a time when surgeries are increasing because of procedures that were postponed during the pandemic.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this in about 30 or 40 years at least,” Dr. Vishesh Chhibber, director of transfusion medicine at UMass Memorial Health, told the Boston Globe.\n\nBorders with Mexico, Canada to remain closed through July\n\nU.S. borders with Mexico and Canada will remain closed \"to reduce the spread\" of COVID-19 through the end of July, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Twitter on Sunday.

By World Health Organization recommendations, anything higher than 5% shows officials aren’t testing widely enough, allowing the virus to spread unchecked. Afghanistan carries out barely 4,000 tests a day and often much less.\n\nAfghanistan’s 24-hour infection count has also continued its upward climb from 1,500 at the end of May when the health ministry was already calling the surge “a crisis,” to more than 2,300 this week.\n\nA Barbados resort offers guests and locals onsite COVID-19 testing\n\nA resort in Barbados created a first-ever COVID-19 lab within a hotel in the Caribbean. Paul Doyle, the owner of The Crane Resort, worked with Barbados Public Health Laboratory and the World Health Organization to receive guidance and acquire the equipment for onsite testing.\n\nFor some guests traveling internationally, returning home requires a negative COVID-19 test. There are some hotels and properties that offer testing at the location but rely on offsite lab processes, resulting in a longer wait to receive results. The resort's lab conducts tests onsite so tests can come back within hours.\n\nThe hotel currently has both PCR COVID testing and rapid antigen testing, which provides results within 15 minutes. Depending on what test is required, the lab can provide guests with fast and convenient COVID-19 testing required for traveling. The lab is also open to locals, ex-pats, and guests from other hotels.\n\n“We know that visitors who have been in lockdown and have waited a long time for their vacations will appreciate a hassle-free airport experience and speedy test results,” Doyle told Forbes.\n\n– Steven Vargas\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/03/zika-q-and-a/79751476/", "title": "Zika Q&A: Congress struggles to reach deal on funding fight against ...", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nU.S. officials are gearing up for the onset of locally transmitted cases of the mosquito-borne Zika virus that is spreading rapidly throughout Latin American and the Caribbean.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers Zika to be the definitive cause of an epidemic of birth defects in Brazil and other countries with outbreaks of the virus. It also causes Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition in which the body attacks its own nerve cells, causing paralysis. The agency warned the virus is \"scarier than we initially thought.\"\n\nThe virus, largely spread by mosquitoes, can sometimes be transmitted sexually or through blood transfusions. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern.\"\n\nHere is the latest on what you need to know:\n\nFull coverage\n\nQ: What is the U.S. doing to prepare for local cases?\n\nA: Congress is still struggling to reach an agreement to provide emergency funding to battle the Zika virus, and lawmakers are worried the fight could last awhile longer, despite increasingly urgent warnings from federal health officials about the need to move quickly to prevent a U.S. outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nThe Senate passed a bill in late May providing $1.1 billion for mosquito-extermination efforts, testing and vaccine research. But the House passed legislation providing only $622 million and redirecting money from other programs to pay for it, including some funds previously dedicated to fighting Ebola.\n\nThe two sides now must come together and reach a compromise that can pass both chambers and be signed by President Obama, who requested $1.9 billion. As an emergency measure, Obama transferred $510 million in unspent Ebola funds to the Zika fight, but public health officials said the country will need much more to prepare for and respond to Zika.\n\nThe CDC wants communities to draw up Zika action plans and has set up a model program for communities to reference. It will release millions of dollars in grants for Zika planning and response but only to states that submit a \"checklist of readiness activities.\"\n\nDespite the efforts, U.S. officials are warning that mosquito eradication efforts, lab tests and vaccine research may not be able to catch up with the number of cases.\n\nQ: How do local cities and regions fight the virus?\n\nA: Fighting mosquitoes is fundamentally a local battle led by a patchwork of 700 mosquito-control districts and more than 1,000 other programs within local governments. In some cities, mosquito control is handled by sophisticated professionals with multimillion dollar budgets. In other communities, mosquito control is more of an afterthought, tacked onto other programs, such as the parks and recreation.\n\nQ: How many Americans have been diagnosed so far?\n\nA: So far, nearly 600 Americans in the continental U.S. have been diagnosed with Zika after returning from visits to countries with outbreaks of the virus. Of those, more than 150 were in pregnant women and more than 10 were sexually transmitted. An additional more than 140 pregnant women from U.S. territories, where the vast majority of cases are locally acquired, have also been infected.\n\nBold Zika mosquitoes love to hang with humans\n\nQ: What parts of the country could be hardest hit?\n\nA: The potential geographic range of the mosquitoes transmitting the virus also reaches farther northward than originally thought, with the Aedes aegypti species present in all or part of 30 states, not just 12. Still, the Gulf Coast — with its steamy climate, abundant mosquitoes and international airports — could be ground zero for the virus.​ More than 60 million Americans live in the five states there — Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.\n\nParts of the U.S. could face a year-round threat from Zika, according to a map of potential hot spots for the virus. Researchers plotted the potential risk for Zika outbreaks in 50 large U.S. cities based on several factors, such as whether the locations are home to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that primarily spreads the virus.\n\nQ: How can the risk of Zika be reduced?\n\nA: Public health officials in the U.S. are calling on home owners to help control mosquitoes this summer by cleaning up trash and other man-made containers that can collect rain water, where the insects breed. Another way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites by staying indoors when visiting an area where the virus is present, wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts, and using mosquito repellent.\n\nQ. Could birth defects occur in the fetuses of pregnant American women?\n\nA. Yes. One American has already given birth to a baby with microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads and incomplete brain development. In addition, two other babies have been born in the U.S. with the defect. And the fetus of an unidentified woman in Puerto Rico also tested positive for the disease. Other pregnant women had abortions after ultrasounds showed abnormalities. Some had miscarriages.\n\nIt's unclear how widespread birth defects will be in the U.S., but the CDC estimates that a fetus infected with Zika during the first three months of pregnancy has up to a 13% risk of developing microcephaly.\n\nQ&A: What is microcephaly, the birth defect linked to Zika?\n\nQ: Are there concerns this summer's Olympics could spread the virus wider?\n\nA: Brazil's hosting of the Games could give mosquitoes a chance to infect people from around the world. Public health officials in Rio de Janeiro downplay the risk, saying there will be fewer mosquitoes when the sporting event opens during the cool month of August. The World Health Organization said there is \"no public health justification\" for postponing the Games. The statement by the Geneva-based U.N. health agency came one day after a group of doctors, scientists and bioethicists wrote a letter to the organization calling for the Aug. 5-21 Games to be postponed or moved because of concerns of the spread of Zika.\n\nQ: How is Zika diagnosed?\n\nA: Diagnosing Zika is difficult because its symptoms can mimic those of other mosquito-borne diseases, and there are is just one commercially available test. Until the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency approval for the first commercial test for Zika, doctors didn't have access to an off-the-shelf test to quickly diagnose patients with the disease. Instead, physicians sent blood samples to state public health labs or the CDC in Atlanta.\n\nUrine tests for Zika more accurate than blood\n\nQ. What advice do U.S. agencies give for couples trying to conceive and pregnant women?\n\nA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says couples trying to conceive should use condoms every time or abstain for six months if the man had confirmed illness or Zika symptoms and was in an outbreak area. If the male partner was in a Zika outbreak area but didn’t get sick, they should abstain or use condoms for eight weeks.\n\nThe agency also warns pregnant women to avoid traveling to areas with Zika outbreaks. The WHO issued similar guidance. Women who cannot avoid traveling should consult their doctors and take steps to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeves and pants. Women thinking of becoming pregnant should also consult their doctors before traveling to outbreak zones.\n\nStudy: Zika may affect babies even in later stages of pregnancy\n\nQ. How serious is the risk of sexual transmission?\n\nA. The WHO says sexual transmission of Zika is more common than previously thought, but scientists still have questions about the first mosquito-borne disease known to spread through sex, including how long it lasts in semen. Doctors aren't sure if a person needs to be sick with obvious symptoms in order to spread the virus through semen.\n\nQ: What does research show about the birth defects Zika causes?\n\nA: The type of microcephaly seen in babies affected by Zika is particularly severe. Babies affected by the virus appear to have \"fetal brain disruption sequence,\" which occurs when normal growth in a fetus is interrupted by a destructive virus or parasite.\n\nIn addition to microcephaly and brain abnormalities, babies with Zika infections also have had eye problems that could cause blindness, extra scalp skin, clubfoot and arthrogryposis, a condition in which newborns' joints are stuck in either a flexed or extended position.\n\nUltrasounds found major abnormalities in 29% of the fetuses from 88 pregnant women in Brazil who tested positive for Zika, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The defects included microcephaly. The fetuses from women not infected with Zika showed no abnormalities.\n\nA separate study uncovered evidence that the Zika virus specifically targets developing brain cells, leading to stunted brain development. The findings, which eventually could identify drugs that treat the virus when it first infects, were published in the scientific journal Cell Stem Cell. The research found the virus affects neural stem cells, which develop into much of the nervous system in fetuses, slowing their growth.\n\nQ: Where is the virus currently spreading?\n\nA: Zika is now active in at least 39 countries and territories, mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus is spreading locally in the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico, which the CDC warned could see hundreds of thousands of cases.\n\nQ: How does it spread?\n\nA: The Aedes mosquito spreads Zika. Unlike the flu, it does not spread from person to person. Mosquitoes that bite an infected person can spread it to future victims.\n\nQ. What are the symptoms of Zika?\n\nA. Four out of five people infected by Zika have no symptoms. Those who do usually have mild symptoms lasting two to seven days, such as fever, rash, headaches, joint pain, muscle pain, lack of energy, weakness and pink eye. It typically takes three to 12 days for illness to develop after a mosquito bite.\n\nQ: Is it deadly?\n\nA: Not usually, but people with pre-existing health problems can develop fatal complications.\n\nQ: Are Americans well informed about Zika?\n\nA: Turns out they're not. Although Zika infections are rarely fatal, 42% of those surveyed thought people infected with the virus are \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to die, according to a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center. About 44% said those infected with Zika would know it because the virus always produces noticeable symptoms, according to the survey. In fact, 80% of people with Zika infections display no symptoms, according to the CDC. A separate survey found nearly one in three people mistakenly believe the virus can be spread by coughing or sneezing, like a cold.\n\nQ: Why are people concerned?\n\nA: The virus causes serious birth defects. Seven countries have reported microcephaly cases related to the outbreak, with more than 1,300 confirmed cases in Brazil, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nChildren with microcephaly may have facial distortions, developmental disabilities, short stature, difficulties with balance and coordination, speech problems and seizures.\n\nQ: What populations are at greatest risk of Zika?\n\nA: People who live in poverty are at greatest risk because they live in environments where mosquitoes thrive: trash-strewn neighborhoods with lots of standing water, where mosquitoes breed, in homes without air conditioning or even window screens to keep the mosquitoes out. Although cities in Latin America and the Caribbean often meet these conditions, many impoverished communities along the Gulf Coast in the USA are also at risk.\n\nQ: How long does Zika last in blood or semen?\n\nA: Scientists largely conclude that Zika stays in the blood for about a week. Mosquitoes can only pick up the virus if they bite someone during this time. Scientists don't know how long Zika can live in semen.\n\nThe virus could linger months longer in the blood of pregnant women than other patients, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine. One pregnant woman's blood tested positive for Zika for 10 weeks after being infected. Doctors can't say for sure why the woman harbored Zika in her blood for so long, in spite of having developed antibodies against the virus.\n\nQ: What other ailments are linked to Zika?\n\nA: Zika can cause Guillain-Barre, a rare immune system disorder that can cause temporary paralysis. WHO reported a number of countries with Zika are also seeing a rise of Guillain-Barre.\n\nThe virus is linked to a second type of autoimmune disorder called acute disseminated encephalomyeltis, which is similar to multiple sclerosis. The condition causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord that affects the myelin, the coating around nerve fibers.\n\nAnother study found the virus may also be associated with a deadly type of brain inflammation. Researchers found the Zika virus in the spinal fluid of an 81-year-old man with meningoencephalitis, a dangerous inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain, according to a report from French researchers in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nQ: Can Zika spread through urine and saliva?\n\nA: Scientists in Brazil found the virus can be \"active\" in the saliva and urine of infected people, but that isn't proof transmission via those routes can occur. More research is needed to confirm a possibility of infection through those fluids.\n\nQ: What are sperm banks doing to keep Zika out of their supplies?\n\nA: U.S. fertility associations have not issued guidelines yet on Zika virus. The British Fertility Society recommends people who have traveled to areas with Zika outbreak should not try to conceive naturally, donate sperm or eggs or undergo fertility treatments for 28 days.\n\nSome sperm banks and fertility societies are taking steps to keep the Zika virus out of supplies of donor sperm to avoid infecting women trying to get pregnant. California Cryobank won't accept sperm donations from men who have traveled to countries with Zika outbreaks in the past month or who have had sex with someone who has traveled there within the past month\n\nQ: Can you get Zika through a blood transfusion?\n\nA: Yes. Brazil has reported that two people have gotten Zika through a blood transfusion. However, the risk of contracting Zika from a blood transfusion in the continental USA is extremely low because the virus is not spreading among local mosquitoes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced it will allow blood centers to screen blood with an experimental test for the Zika virus. The test means that blood donation and collection can resume on Puerto Rico, which had stopped collecting blood in early March because there was no way to test donations for Zika.\n\nQ: Are blood banks taking precautions?\n\nA: Yes. The American Red Cross is asking people to avoid donating blood if they've traveled to Zika-affected areas in the past 28 days. The American Association of Blood Banks issued a similar recommendation. Canadian Blood Services is barring people from giving blood within 21 days of traveling outside Canada, the continental USA and Europe.\n\nQ: How can people reduce the risk of sexual transmission?\n\nA: Using condoms and practicing safe sex reduces the risk of sexual transmission of Zika. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new recommendations that men who have live in or have traveled to an outbreak area should wear condoms or abstain from sex if they have a pregnant sexual partner.\n\nQ: What is WHO doing to fight the virus?\n\nA: The organization is asking nations around the world for $56 million to fight the Zika virus through the end of June, but the agency has only received $3 million so far.\n\nQ: What are outside organizations doing?\n\nA: The World Bank offered $150 million to fight the Zika outbreak and provide medical care. The institution said more funds could be made available if needed in the future.\n\nQ: When did Zika emerge?\n\nA: Zika virus appeared for the first time in 1947 in Uganda. For decades, health experts considered it a minor-league virus that, until recently, was limited to a narrow belt of equatorial Africa and Asia.\n\nQ: When and where did this current outbreak begin?\n\nA: Zika was first detected in Brazil in May. ​Researchers suspect the virus may have arrived in South America during the 2014 World Cup Games that drew millions of fans to Brazil. However, a new study suggests it may have reached the county between May and December 2013.\n\nQ: Why did some nations advise women to postpone pregnancy?\n\nA: The spike in birth defects in Brazil prompted Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica to recommend women delay pregnancy until doctors understand more about the virus. El Salvador issued the strongest warning, urging women not to conceive for two years.\n\nHowever, scientists have no idea how long the Zika virus will pose a risk to pregnant women. Health officials in El Salvador believe that people could develop immunity to the virus over time.\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Zika-affected nations to repeal restrictive laws that limit access to contraception and abortion, saying advice to delay pregnancy \"ignores the reality that many women and girls simply cannot exercise control over whether or when or under what circumstances they become pregnant.\"\n\nAbout half of pregnancies are unplanned.\n\nQ: What actions is the travel industry taking?\n\nA: All three of the USA's biggest airlines are allowing some customers to cancel or postpone their trips if they’re ticketed to fly to areas affected by Zika. Hilton Worldwide and Hyatt hotels are waiving cancellation fees in affected areas. Marriott International and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts are addressing cancellation requests on a case-by-case basis but being liberal in waiving fees.\n\nQ: What treatments or vaccines are available for Zika virus?\n\nA: There are no approved treatments or vaccines for Zika.\n\nQ: How is microcephaly treated?\n\nA: There's no treatment for microcephaly. Dozens of Brazilian babies have died. Although some children have normal intelligence and development, their heads remain small, according to the Mayo Clinic.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/03"}]}

Highlighting this issue when setting out the case for ID cards, Kinnock said: “I thought it was extraordinary in the wake of Brexit that everybody said, ‘Oh, there are three million EU citizens in the UK’, and it turned out there were five million. It is just simply extraordinary that we had two million more people in our country than we thought we did. That is just not sustainable.” While a good universal ID system “can make the delivery of and access to public services more efficient” argued GMA News in 2018, it could also prevent immigration crises like the Windrush scandal.\n\nCon: encroach on rights Libertarians and civil rights groups have long campaigned against the idea of mandatory ID cards, arguing they infringe on individual liberties. Boris Johnson, a vocal opponent of the scheme, wrote in The Telegraph in 2004: “There is the loss of liberty, and the creepy reality that the state will use these cards – doubtless with the best possible intentions – to store all manner of detail about us, our habits, what benefits we may claim, and so on”. Speaking this week, former Tory policing minister Kit Malthouse told Times Radio “it’s not far to jump from that to us all having a barcode tattooed on us at birth”. “It is 20 years since New Labour consulted on a proposal for mandatory ID cards under David Blunkett, the then home secretary. The plans proved controversial then, and they will no doubt be controversial now,” said Labour List. However, “supporters of ID cards argue that two decades on, the data people readily share with social media sites and private companies has tilted the balance on privacy arguments,” said The Times. In a bid to address these civil liberty concerns, Kinnock suggested everyone would apply for registration, while the data stored would be limited to address civil liberties concerns to a “very simple and basic” form of ID.\n\nPro: can end trafficking A report published in July by the Tony Blair Institute recommended introducing universal mandatory digital identity cards to help to alleviate the Channel migrant crisis, which has seen almost 40,000 migrants illegally reach the UK in small boats this year. Many of these are the victims of criminal gangs making thousands of pounds on each journey. In a 2018 report supporting universal ID cards, the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange said that illegal immigration “fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes”. “Combating [illegal immigration]…should be overtly linked to the enforcement of the minimum wage, private landlord licensing and action against modern slavery”, it concluded.\n\nCon: don’t tackle illegal migration The Daily Telegraph suggested there is “little evidence” that ID cards would help combat illegal immigration. “Many people who are described as illegal immigrants are, in fact, asylum-seekers,” the paper said. “An ID scheme would not prevent their arrival in the country” as “existing restraints – such as National Insurance checks and minimum wage requirements – are already flouted.”\n\nPro: regulate access to employment “One reason that migrants and refugees are so keen to get to the UK is that it is easier then to get a job and housing because we do not require identity cards” said former Tory minister David Willetts in Conservative Home. Under the Tony Blair Institute’s plans, all individuals would be required to produce their digital identity card, showing their legal right to reside, to access employment or benefits. The report said that this would make it harder for undocumented migrants to “disappear” into the informal economy. The Times said the proposals “are likely to be welcomed by the French government, which has repeatedly blamed Britain’s informal labour market for attracting so many illegal migrants to cross the Channel”. “I do not like the idea of ID cards any more than I like higher taxes, but they are a very effective way of policing access to jobs and public services” said Willetts, adding that “a Britain with ID cards would be much less attractive to migrants.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}]}

Less than three years after leading the Conservatives to their biggest election victory in 30 years, the former mayor of London announced he was stepping down in July after the mass resignation of ministers made his position untenable. In his last article as PM, published in the Sunday Express last weekend, Johnson said the brutal mud-slinging that has marred the Tory leadership race must stop for the good of party and country. This is “the moment for every Conservative to come together and back the new leader wholeheartedly”, he wrote. Nicknamed “Teflon” for his ability to emerge unscathed from scandals that would sink most other politicians, Johnson’s time in No. 10 has been dominated by Brexit, Covid and scandals. Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership: 24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office After becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days. In a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”. Brexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”. 3 September 2019: he loses his majority Johnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit. Skip advert Johnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill. 13 December 2019: a general election victory After forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”. Equally “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote. 7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 Just four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus. The then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper. In an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”. 13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns Dominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain. Their departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”. Although Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed. 8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out One of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site. Skip advert But criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported. 21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’ The hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period. “I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.” But a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all. 29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds After a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. Only 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported. Some “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph. 19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’ As England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC. No. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News. 30 November 2021: Partygate allegations The first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror. Skip advert The paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”. Downing Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”. However, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season. 25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe The Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation. The force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met. 9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine In what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Johnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”. “I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.” Skip advert Johnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported. In a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”. 12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties Johnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian. His wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak. After Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go. “Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News. 6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote Mounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected. Despite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.” Noting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.” Skip advert Nevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year. 15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits A week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”. Geidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street. 30 June: the Chris Pincher affair What started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career. Chris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club. Yet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022. “Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC. Speaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954041/a-short-history-of-the-uks-honour-scandals", "title": "A history of the UK's honours scandals | The Week UK", "text": "The doling out of honours in the UK is never short of controversy. And the latest announcement is no different after critics responded with disbelief to the news that former education secretary Gavin Williamson is to receive a knighthood. “Headteachers and education union leaders expressed shock and surprise” when Downing Street yesterday said that the Queen had approved the honour for “political and public service”, The Telegraph reported. Explaining the unusual timing of the announcement, one government source told the paper it had been planned for the New Year Honours list but had been “delayed” after Williamson became entangled in the “Partygate” scandal. The question of whether the honours system is open to financial or other influence has haunted British public life for decades. Here are some of the most bitter disputes over honours in recent UK political history: Lloyd George’s ‘cash for patronage’ scandal David Lloyd George enjoyed an illustrious political career, including serving as prime minister from 1916 to 1922. But the Liberal PM found himself embroiled in a major “cash for patronage” scandal over his resignation honours list in 1922. Although the purchase of peerages was not illegal, Lloyd George was accused of raising funds for his party through the sale of peerages, as well as using the honours system to (unsuccessfully) avoid criticism from newspapers. It was the brazenness of Lloyd George’s “price list for peerages” that caused a scandal. They were arranged through political fixer Maundy Gregory, who sold peerages “ranging from £10,000 (more than £400,000 today) for a knighthood up to £40,000 for a baronetcy”, according to The Guardian. From 1917 to 1922, more than “120 hereditary peers alone were created”, said The Spectator. So many knighthoods were given out in Cardiff – Lloyd George had grown up in Wales and spoke Welsh as his first language – that “it became known as the ‘city of dreadful knights’”, said the magazine. Skip advert The scandal led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act in 1925, and Gregory would eventually become the only person to be convicted under the act, continuing to falsely offer honours to the wealthy and connected into the 1930s. Wilson’s Lavender List Allegedly handwritten on pastel-hued paper by Harold Wilson’s closest aide Marcia Williams, later Lady Falkender, the so-called “Lavender List” has become an infamous document in modern political history.\n\nThe list named businessmen Wilson had chosen to honour to mark his 1976 resignation, making way for James Callaghan as the next prime minister. The list was controversial as many felt it “sanctioned the ennobling and knighting of crooked and dubious businessmen”, according to The Times – many of whom held views antithetical to the values of the Labour Party. Names included a knighthood for Joseph Kagan, later convicted of false accounting, and businessman Eric Miller, who committed suicide while his firm was being investigated. But further controversy was fuelled by the suggestion that Lady Falkender was either the principal author of the list or had sought to add to the list in order to reward her friends and financially benefit from the list herself. The list was seen as “an indication of the sway she held over Wilson, her alleged lover”, reported the paper. Lady Falkender denied any involvement in compiling the list, maintaining she had “merely copied it from another list, on pink”, said the Financial Times in her 2019 obituary. And in 2007, the BBC was forced to pay her £75,000 in libel damages after a BBC Four docu-drama claimed she had conducted an affair with Wilson and had undue influence over the list. Blair’s ‘cash-for-honours’ scandal In 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police as part of a political corruption inquiry that would drag on for 16 months, and overshadow the last days of his premiership. An investigation was launched after SNP MP Angus MacNeil complained that four wealthy businessmen were nominated by Tony Blair for peerages after lending the party a total of £5m. All four of the peerages were blocked by the House of Lords appointments commission, and MacNeil’s complaint launched a police investigation into whether laws banning the sale of honours had been broken. Skip advert The police inquiries would lead to 136 people being interviewed, according to the BBC, and Blair himself would be questioned three times, although not under caution and “as a witness rather than a suspect”. Labour’s chief fundraiser Lord Levy – nicknamed “Lord Cashpoint” by the tabloid press – was arrested twice on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. In 2007, the police would hand a 216-page report on the scandal to the Crown Prosecution Service – which later announced it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone.

Leaked emails obtained by the Daily Mail suggested that the Conservatives “used nearly £60,000 of party funds” on the “lavish makeover” and had earmarked specific donations. The decor was said to have included “hand-crafted” £840-a-roll gold wallpaper designed by interior decorator Lulu Lytle.\n\nJohnson had clashed horns with the commissioner and the standards committee on at least two prior occasions. In 2018, as an MP, he was ordered by the watchdog to apologise over the late declaration of £52,000 in book royalty payments. And just three months before becoming PM the following summer, Johnson was criticised for taking nearly a year to register his 20% stake in a Somerset property worth more than £100,000. The committee said that Johnson’s disregard for the 28-day time limit set for MPs to register such financial interests reinforced “their previous view that he had displayed an over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the House”.\n\nLittle more than nine months after Johnson became PM, The Observer revealed that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards had launched an investigation into a ten-day holiday that he and his partner Carrie Johnson (then Symonds) had taken on the Caribbean island of Mustique between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. The Tory leader had said that the £15,000 post-election break was funded by party donor David Ross. But Johnson’s declaration in the register of MPs’ interests “was later contradicted by Ross”, said the paper, which noted that it was “the first time a serving prime minister has been investigated by the commissioner”.\n\nHere are the most significant allegations that Johnson and his government have faced.\n\nHe has also refused to apologise over the row that erupted last week after the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards recommended that Tory MP Owen Paterson be suspended . Johnson has fallen foul of the committee more than once before too, both prior to and after entering Downing Street.\n\nInstead of attending the emergency debate on Monday afternoon, Johnson fulfiled what Downing Street said was a “long-standing engagement” at Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland. During his visit, the PM declined to answer reporters’ questions about recent “cash for House of Lords seats” allegations.\n\nJohnson’s own adviser on standards, Christopher Geidt, concluded that while the ministerial code had not been broken, the PM had “unwisely” allowed the refurbishment “to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded”. The Institute of Government said the episode “highlighted concerns both about the way the money was managed, and about the failure of the prime minister, and possibly the Conservative Party, to make full declarations and answer questions”.\n\nNo. 10 denied any wrongdoing, in what has since been dubbed the “cash for curtains” scandal.\n\n8 July 2021: Mustique row verdict\n\nJohnson was cleared by the committee examining his Mustique trip. Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that the PM was right to name Ross on the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, because the Tory donor had “facilitated the visit” by arranging Johnson’s accommodation through a local holiday company.\n\nThe regulator’s report noted that this involvement only came to light as a result of their own enquiries. Given that Johnson had been “twice reprimanded by the previous standards committee in the last parliament in the space of four months”, said the report, the PM might have been expected “to go the extra mile” to ensure there was no uncertainty about his holiday arrangements.\n\n3 November 2021: Paterson furore\n\nThe PM backed a bid last week to overturn the six-week suspension of Tory MP Paterson, a former environment secretary under David Cameron, for breaking lobbying rules. Johnson ordered his party to vote for an amendment that would halt the suspension recommended by the standards committee and instead create a new watchdog group with a built-in Tory majority.\n\nAn analysis by Business Insider found that of the 248 Conservative MPs who followed their leader’s instructions, 22 had been investigated by the existing watchdog since the 2019 election. And 19 “had claims against them upheld by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards”, the news site reported.\n\nAfter the government won the amendment with an 18-vote majority, Starmer said that it was “no surprise” to see the Conservative Party “yet again wallowing in sleaze”.\n\n“The rot starts at the top,” the Labour leader added.\n\n4 November 2021: rapid U-turn\n\nLess than 24 hours after the vote, Johnson changed his mind. Amid outrage both from within the Tory party and beyond, the government announced that separate new votes would be held on improving the standards system and the outcome for Paterson. Hours later, Paterson announced his resignation from his role as North Shropshire MP and “the cruel world of politics”.\n\nIn a separate development, The Telegraph revealed that Conservative chiefs had been handed the initial findings of the “cash for curtains” investigation, to give the party an opportunity to respond ahead of the commission’s final ruling.\n\n7 November 2021: Lords seats allegations\n\nThe government has become embroiled in a new sleaze row after The Sunday Times reported that House of Lords seats were being offered to Conservative donors who contribute more than £3m to the party.\n\nAccording to a investigation by the paper and independent political website openDemocracy, multimillionaire donors “appear to be guaranteed a peerage if they take on the temporary role as the party treasurer and increase their own donations beyond £3m”.\n\nThe peerage of one such donor – billionaire businessman Peter Cruddas – was reportedly pushed through by Johnson against the recommendation of the Lords Appointments Commission.\n\nThe PM’s decision to “override what we did... left a bad taste in my mouth”, an unnamed commission member told the joint investigation.\n\nResponding to the claims, a Conservative spokesperson said: “We do not believe that successful businesspeople and philanthropists who contribute to political causes and parties should be disqualified from sitting in the legislature.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954682/what-is-behind-boris-johnsons-intervention-in-the-paterson-sleaze-row", "title": "Owen Paterson resigns after PM's U-turn in sleaze row | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/02/14/little-house-wisconsin-writers-laura-ingalls-wilder-aldo-leopold-lorine-niedecker/2265330002/", "title": "Visit the little houses that inspired big Wisconsin writers", "text": "Jim Higgins\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nWhile working on a book about literary giants from our state, I discovered the secret formula of how to be a great Wisconsin writer:\n\nLive in a tiny house.\n\nYoung Laura Ingalls Wilder's \"Little House in the Big Woods\" was a simple cabin. Aldo Leopold's Shack outside Baraboo was a converted chicken coop. Lorine Niedecker's tiny house on Blackhawk Island near the Rock River is no bigger than a mobile home.\n\nA tiny house promotes many qualities useful to a writer, including organization, ruthless decision making and resourcefulness. (Niedecker wrote an amusing series of poems on the pages of a biweekly calendar, pasting her handwritten words on the center of each page. The width of the pasted sheet and the size of her handwriting determine the line breaks.)\n\nIt’s a laboratory for emotional intimacy and human conflict. You’re observing other people and yourself in close quarters all the time. There's nowhere to hide.\n\nFinally, it drives people outside. Nobody wants to stay cooped up in that tiny house all day.\n\nClose observation of the natural world is a quality we often associate with Wisconsin's great writers. But now we can flip the script on them by observing their habitats. Whether you hope to absorb a speck of their magic, or simply enhance the pleasure of a favorite book, there's a Wisconsin writer trip waiting for you.\n\nHere are a few suggestions.\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder\n\nPepin\n\nThe image of Wisconsin that young Laura Ingalls describes in \"Little House in the Big Woods\" may still be the primal ideal of this state in the back of many people's minds:\n\n“The great, dark trees of the Big Woods stood all around the house, and beyond them were other trees and beyond them were more trees. … There were only trees and the wild animals who had their homes among them.”\n\nShe was born on Feb. 6, 1867, seven miles north of Pepin in the Chippewa River valley. \"Little House in the Big Woods,\" her only novel set in this state, has an almost timeless quality to its depiction of chores and cozy family life. For example, the story makes almost no allusion to the recently ended Civil War that tore apart the nation.\n\nIn contrast to the year depicted in \"Little House in the Big Woods,\" Wilder actually lived in Wisconsin twice: first, from her birth in 1867 until 1869, when her family moved on to the Osage Indian Reserve in Kansas, where they lived about a year — illegally, it turns out. The Ingalls family returned to Wisconsin in 1871, in part because the man who bought their former Wisconsin property couldn’t pay for it. In early 1874, they left the state for good, crossing frozen Lake Pepin into Minnesota.\n\nWisconsin honors this famous daughter through the modest, homey Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum, 306 Third St., Pepin, which features several rooms with displays of books, images, clothing, tools and artifacts related to Laura, or inspired by her, or representative of her time. The museum is open from May through October; call (715) 513-6383 or visit lauraingallspepin.com for information and opening date.\n\nIn 2019, Pepin's annual Laura Ingalls Wilder Days will take place Sept. 14-15, with crafts, pioneer activities, contests and general Laura-ness. The 2019 special guest will be artist Renée Graef, illustrator of many of the \"My First Little House\" picture books.\n\nBe sure to visit the Little House Wayside on County Highway CC, about seven miles northwest of Pepin. This replica log cabin stands on the spot where Charles and Caroline Ingalls built their own modest home. It makes a fine photo stop, and walking into the small cabin helps a reader of \"Little House in the Big Woods\" grasp how cozy the Ingalls family environment was.\n\nAldo Leopold\n\nSauk County\n\nIn 1935, Aldo Leopold acquired a worn-out farm in Sauk County on the Wisconsin River as a hunting base camp and family getaway. Leopold and his older sons cleared a year's worth of manure out of its old chicken coop and put on a new roof. Over the years, the Leopolds would refer to it simply as the Shack. It became the heart of their family recreation and the co-star of his book \"A Sand County Almanac.\"\n\nIn 1936, Leopold and his family planted 2,000 pine trees and many shrubs on the property, the beginning of a restoration project that continued for years, with Leopold and company doggedly planting thousands more trees after many of the first ones died. The Leopolds visited the Shack as often as Aldo’s work and the children’s school schedules allowed, though they were limited during the World War II years by the need to conserve gas coupons.\n\nA University of Wisconsin professor and a pioneer of wildlife management, Leopold compiled a book of ecological essays and observations of nature in the 1940s. Published in 1949, a year after his death, \"A Sand County Almanac\" has sold millions of copies and influenced waves of conservationists who have followed him, inspired by the principle he expressed in his essay “The Land Ethic”: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”\n\nNo species in this ecosystem is too small for Leopold’s attention or too insignificant to support his preferential option for wildness. In “Prairie Birthday,” he describes how he looks forward each July to the reappearance of the compass plant in “a pin-point remnant of the native prairie” found in a local graveyard. When a fence protecting the plant is removed, Leopold worries that this accidental bit of wild Wisconsin will disappear forever: “Keep cow, plow, and mower out of these idle spots, and the full native flora, plus dozens of interesting stowaways from foreign parts, could be part of the normal environment of every citizen.”\n\nThe Aldo Leopold Foundation in Baraboo, established by his children, manages the Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm, which is open for both guided and self-guided tours when weather permits (the Shack is inaccessible during heavy snow cover). Walking around the Shack on a humid August day, I admired the labor of the Leopolds, planting and replanting thousands of trees here — and wondered how many billions of mosquitoes they fended off.\n\nThe Leopold Center, less than a mile from the Shack, is one of the country’s greenest buildings, earning a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design honor from the U.S. Green Building Council; it was built from pines that the Leopold family planted in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nFor information about tours and the foundation’s work, visit aldoleopold.org.\n\nReminders of Leopold abound in this state. In 2008, the state of Wisconsin renamed its system of recreational trails, adding up to 1,728 miles, the Aldo Leopold Legacy Trail System. The Aldo Leopold Nature Center in Monona teaches thousands of children each year.\n\nRELATED:Young people embrace wilderness at Aldo Leopold Nature Center in Monona\n\nIn 1947, Leopold spoke at the dedication of a monument to the extinct passenger pigeon at Wyalusing State Park in Grant County, south of Prairie du Chien. The largest recorded nesting of the birds spread across 850 square miles of west-central Wisconsin in 1871, an estimated 136 million birds. But their nesting habits also made them easy to kill. The last known member of the species died in 1914.\n\nLeopold’s talk, printed in \"A Sand County Almanac\" under the title “On the Monument to a Pigeon,” grieves and salutes the bird, still remembered by people living at the time. Leopold does not browbeat his fellow homo sapiens. Instead, he notes humanity’s capacity to grieve the loss: “For one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun.”\n\nUsing available wood, Leopold made simple benches with backrests so he could spend as much time as possible outside. Leopold benches are a common sight today in parks, along trails and in some yards. There's probably one near you.\n\nLorine Niedecker\n\nFort Atkinson\n\nIn the late 1950s, one of the finest poets in the United States worked as a cleaning lady at Fort Atkinson Hospital. When Lorine Niedecker couldn't catch a ride to work, she walked several miles from her home on marshy Blackhawk Island before getting down to scrubbing floors.\n\nNiedecker (1903-'70) spent most of her life in the same patch of Wisconsin. She was not widely known in that pre-Internet era. But a visitor to Fort Atkinson can see many traces of her there today.\n\nAt the corner of North Main Street and West Sherman Avenue downtown, words from her poetry are painted on two exterior walls. The first poetry wall, painted in 2009, offers the opening words of her \"Paean to Place\": “Fish / fowl / flood / Water lily mud / My life.”\n\nIn 2018, artist Jeremy Guzzo Pinc finished a new mural across the street, using more words from \"Paean to Place,\" including the bird-loving Niedecker's description of herself as \"the solitary plover / a pencil / for a wing-bone\". Each word in Pinc's new mural is rendered differently in color, font or style, requiring a viewer to slow down to absorb it all.\n\nFor much of her life, Niedecker lived on marshy Blackhawk Island, which is actually a peninsula formed by the Rock River flowing into Lake Koshkonong. The autobiographical \"Paean to Place\" describes the flooding that periodically\n\nsoaked her riverside abode. Her tiny home belongs to private owners and isn't open to visitors, but a historical marker notes the spot.\n\nNiedecker once worked for the Dwight Foster Public Library, 209 Merchants Ave., Fort Atkinson; the Foster now holds the archive of Niedecker’s personal library\n\nand other materials and has named a room after her. In fact, visitors who walk through the main door of the library are greeted by her words on the wall.\n\nThe Hoard Historical Museum, 401 Whitewater Ave. in Fort Atkinson, also has a Niedecker room and archive. (Niedecker worked for a time as a stenographer and proofreader for Hoard’s Dairyman, a farm magazine.)\n\nThe annual Lorine Niedecker Wisconsin Poetry Festival in Fort Atkinson, organized by the nonprofit group The Friends of Lorine Niedecker, honors her with readings by contemporary poets and other speakers.

I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields.

Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M. Toss in a bit of Bruce Springsteen. Add a pinch of Roger Waters. Mix it up, and you get some music resembling Arcade Fire's \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nDon't you hate trying to describe how a group or an album sounds to someone who hasn't heard it? What you hear, the similarities or echoes, may hit others differently. \"That doesn't sound like Springsteen, I think it sounds like ", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2013/07/02/inspirational-romance-womens-fiction-new-releases-july-2013/2480575/", "title": "Click here for newer inspirationals and women's fiction", "text": "Joyce Lamb\n\nUSATODAY\n\nHere are some newer inspirational romances and women's fiction, compiled for you and HEA by some of our favorite authors (info provided by publishers and/or their websites).

For as long as she can remember, Ruby has done what's practical, eschewing far-fetched dreams and true love in favor of stability. But suddenly single again at the age of forty-four, she's beginning to discover that life is most delicious when you stop following a recipe and just live.\n\nThe Care and Handling of Roses with Thorns by Margaret Dilloway (Penguin). Roses are Galilee Garner's passion. An amateur breeder, she painstakingly cross-pollinates her plants to coax out new, better traits, striving to create a perfect strain of her favorite flower, the Hulthemia. Her dream is to win a major rose competition and one day have her version of the bloom sold in the commercial market. Gal carefully calibrates the rest of her time to manage the kidney failure she's had since childhood. The routine leaves little room for relationships, and Gal prefers it that way. Her roses never disappoint her the way people have.

For the past ten years, Vera Van Loon has been beating the city heat at her friend's idyllic lakeside guest cabin. There, she's Aunt Loony to Kit Garrett's teenagers, a kayaker instead of a straphanger—and a million miles away from the complications of \"real\" life in Manhattan. If only she didn't have to alternate weekends with one of the Garretts' relatives, everything would be perfect—until she discovers the truth: \"Uncle\" Cyrus is hardly the man she thought he was. He's just her type, wildly appealing—and a worthy Scrabble opponent. All of a sudden, everything is perfect until Labor Day. Because Cyrus prefers the rural life, and Vera could never give up New York.\n\nThe Life List: A Novel by Lori Nelson Spielman (Random House). Brett Bohlinger seems to have it all: a plum job, a spacious loft, an irresistibly handsome boyfriend. That is, until her beloved mother passes away, leaving behind a will with one big stipulation: In order to receive her inheritance, Brett must first complete the life list of goals she'd written when she was a naïve girl of fourteen. Grief-stricken, Brett can barely make sense of her mother's decision—her childhood dreams don't resemble her ambitions at age thirty-four in the slightest. How can she possibly have a relationship with a father who died seven years ago? Other goals (Be an awesome teacher!) would require her to reinvent her entire future. As Brett reluctantly embarks on a perplexing journey in search of her adolescent dreams, one thing becomes clear. Sometimes life's sweetest gifts can be found in the most unexpected places.\n\nWhat's His Is Mine by Daaimah S. Poole (Kensington).

And Ali, their trusted nanny, watches it all. As the babysitter, she brings a unique insider-outsider perspective to the family, seeing far more than even the family itself is capable of. But when a reporter with a personal connection to the story comes asking her for the inside scoop, will Ali remain loyal to the family who never saw her as anything other than the help? Or will she tell her side?\n\nWhistling Past the Graveyard by Susan Crandall (Gallery Books ).

And if Cathy still loves him after eleven years absence, she's not telling.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

Provisional results tallied by major TV stations showed frontrunners Raila Odinga and William Ruto neck-and-neck in the race. However, with more than 13 million out of some 14 million votes tallied, the broadcasters have stopped updating the tally as of Thursday night.\n\nKenyan election law requires designated poll officials known as returning officers to bring physical forms showing results from across the nation to the tallying center in the capital Nairobi.\n\nThe IEBC has until Monday, August 15 to declare the results. The commission has latched onto legislation that allows for up to seven days (from polling day) to announce a winner. The delay has fueled disinformation among Kenyans who are anxious to know who their next president is. Some influential Kenyans have posted unverified claims on social media regarding the conduct of the election while announcing victory for their preferred candidates.\n\nThe presidential contest is largely considered a two-horse race between Deputy President Ruto and veteran opposition leader Odinga, who was backed for the top job by outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta.", "authors": ["Larry Madowo Bethlehem Feleke Nimi Princewill", "Larry Madowo", "Bethlehem Feleke", "Nimi Princewill"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}]}
