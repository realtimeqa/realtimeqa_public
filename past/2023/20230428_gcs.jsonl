The president has said it’s his intention to seek a second term but that after a lifetime scarred by personal tragedy, he’s a great respecter of fate. Whatever happens, the question of the president’s health and mental capacity is certain to be at the center of any 2024 campaign – both because Republicans will put it there and because it’s a reasonable concern for voters sizing up their commander-in-chief.\n\nBiden’s birthday comes at a moment when the question of how old is too old to serve in top political leadership posts is under a new spotlight.\n\nOn Thursday for instance, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 82, announced that she would step down from the leadership as the Democratic Party moves into the minority in the next Congress.\n\n“For me, the hour’s come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus that I so deeply respect,” Pelosi said, in a floor speech that felt like a moment when an era came to an end.\n\nAfter two decades at the top of her party in the House, Pelosi was doing something that is fundamental to a democracy’s capacity to sustain and regenerate itself – she voluntarily gave up power – an honorable tradition inaugurated by President George Washington when he declined to seek a third term. But Pelosi also implicitly posed the question of whether if it is now time for her to hand authority and responsibility to younger colleagues – is it time for others to do so too?\n\nAfter all, the seductive idea of a passing of a generational torch has been a powerful symbol in modern American history – and animated the rise of presidents like John Kennedy and Bill Clinton, for instance. And the poignant truth about American politics is that decisions are being made on issues like climate change, foreign policy and health care that will reverberate in decades to come that top leaders will not live to see.\n\nTrump and the threat of a young pretender\n\nBut the old guard is still in control right now.\n\nTwo days before Pelosi’s announcement, a slightly younger political titan, Donald Trump, gave word that at the age of 76 that he was far from ready to leave the stage. The ex-president launched a campaign for a new White House term that would take him well past his 80th birthday if he were to win the 2024 election.\n\nIn the Senate, Minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is 80, resisted an effort by a younger colleague – Florida Sen. Rick Scott, 69 – to topple him for his leadership post. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, who is celebrating the Democratic midterm election victory which means the party will hang onto the chamber, is a comparative young buck at 71.\n\nIn some ways, the verve and drive of older leaders is admirable at an age when many people are long retired – and an example to society that the elderly are just as capable and worthy as younger generations. The elixir of power that leads them to endure the indignities and the spotlight of a political career remains a marvel. Biden for instance, who spent most of his adult life chasing after the presidency, is just back from a grueling trip to Egypt and Asia. The flight home on Air Force One alone took 24 hours.\n\nYet the prominence of the seventy-and-eighty somethings at the top of the political tree does also raise questions about whether it is healthy that younger politicians are not at this moment in American history taking more responsibility or have more power. There is a sense that neither political party has done a good job grooming more youthful heirs, a scenario that that risks further creating distance between politicians and rising generations. That could be a particular problem for Democrats since CNN’s exit polls in the midterm elections suggested that 55% of the party’s voters were aged 18 to 44. A majority of GOP voters – 54% – were older than 45.\n\nInstitutional political traditions are also an impediment to youth – especially in Congress where power is built on seniority that takes painstaking years to accrue.\n\nAt the same time however, younger politicians might also need to look in the mirror. The reason why Biden, Trump and Pelosi are still the most powerful leaders in the country is that so far, no younger, dynamic, history making figures have emerged from below to force them off the scene. Biden and Trump fought off younger rivals in their presidential primaries and proved themselves to their own sets of voters. Pelosi’s skill at keeping her conference together and supporting Democratic presidents made her an icon in her party, and apart from a few periods of grumbling from younger subordinates, she escaped serious leadership challenges.\n\nHere’s one indicator of the dearth of up-and-coming talent in the Democratic Party: The most energizing campaigner in the midterms was from a younger generation – but since he’d already served two White House terms, ex-President Barack Obama served to emphasize the lack of top talent on the Democratic bench.\n\nTrump meanwhile may have more to fear from a young pretender.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 44, was born in the 1970s – at a time when the most recent Republican president was filling tabloids as he carved a reputation as a wheeler dealer and New York City playboy. (When DeSantis was born in 1978, Biden was already running for his second Senate term. If the Florida governor were to win the GOP nomination and face Biden in a general election, the president would face the unappealing prospect of standing on a debate stage with a rival who was roughly half his age.)\n\nIs it time for younger leaders to step up?\n\nTrump’s early announcement of a third presidential campaign this week failed to unite the party around him amid growing criticism that the ex-president’s election denialism was responsible for suppressing a GOP red wave in the midterms. Trump’s best hope, however, is that his fervent base voters might see any attempt by DeSantis, who roared to reelection last week, to topple their hero as a betrayal.\n\nThat is one reason why DeSantis, who after all, has time on his side, might ultimately decide to give the 2024 race a pass. But there already signs that the post-Trump generation of politicians is itching to take his movement forward.\n\nFormer UN ambassador Nikki Haley, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem have all been mentioned as potential heirs to his throne – though there is no sign that the ex-president is ready to give it up.\n\nA better-than-expected performance by Democrats in the midterms helped to ease some of the questions about Biden’s decision about a reelection race. The president’s position is also being helped by the lack of clear successors.\n\nDemocrats fret about the prospects of Vice President Kamala Harris should Biden not stand, after her misfiring 2020 primary bid and her uneven performance in office over the last two years. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was the breakout star of that campaign, but his path to the Democratic nomination looks challenging. The midterms did produce some prospective Democratic candidates of the future – reelected Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the new governor of Pennsylvania – Josh Shapiro. But there’s not exactly a generational star like Obama waiting to rocket to power. and there’s no compulsion for Biden to step down because a can’t miss younger leader is waiting in the wings.\n\nStill, polls this year have consistently suggested that Americans aren’t keen on a Trump vs. Biden rematch. And in the midterm exit polls only 30% of respondents wanted the president to run for reelection. Still, with an approval rating of 40% in those exit polls, he’s slightly more popular than Trump who had only a 38% approval rating among all voters.\n\nIn her speech announcing her departure from leadership Thursday, Pelosi recalled that “scripture teaches us that for everything, there is a season.”\n\nHer epiphany is however unlikely to stop other political leaders of an advanced age trying to defy time.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Joe Biden was running for his second Senate term when Ron DeSantis was born in 1978.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/16/biden-medical-physical-2024-re-election-bid/11172774002/", "title": "Biden physical results: Does president's exam provide clues for 2024?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden remains a \"healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,\" the White House physician said Thursday after the president received his first physical exam in a year and a half.\n\nOne small lesion, however, was removed from the president's chest during the examination and will be sent for a traditional biopsy, Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, said in a letter that otherwise mostly reflected his last medical checkup from November 2021.\n\nBiden's routine physical has taken on extra scrutiny as the octogenarian is widely expected to announce a reelection bid in the coming weeks or months. Already the oldest person to assume the presidency, Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nIn search of the perfect president:What Americans say they want, from age to gender\n\nResults of the biopsy are pending. O'Connor observed that Biden's gait remains stiff but has not worsened since his physical in 2021, attributing the stiffness to spinal arthritis, a previously broken foot and mild neuropathy in his feet.\n\nNeurological exam shows no brain disorders, motor weakness\n\nBiden underwent an “extremely detailed” neurological exam that O’Connor said uncovered no findings consistent with a brain or central neurological disorder, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nThe exam did show a “mild peripheral neuropathy” in both feet, O’Connor said. Biden did not demonstrate any motor weakness, the physician said, but showed a subtle difference in heat/cold sensation. O’Connor stressed that Biden’s symptoms haven’t progressed and have actually improved since his last exam.\n\nBiden, who had a COVID-19 infection in July, followed by a rebound case, has not experienced any residual symptoms associated with \"Long COVID,\" O'Connor said.\n\nBiden weighs 178 pounds and had a blood pressure rate of of 128/76 and pulse rate of 69, the physician’s report said. That's six pounds less than the 184 pounds he weighed in 2021.\n\nBiden experiences occasional bouts of gastroesophageal reflux, which causes him to clear his throat often and may contribute to occasional cough and sinus congestion, the report said. The symptoms are typically exacerbated shortly after meals. The physician said he will continue to take the acid blocker Pepcid.\n\nWhile Biden acknowledges that questions about his age are legitimate, he has also insisted he’s capable of serving four more years.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Biden has said more than once, including in an interview last week.\n\n\"I would be completely, thoroughly honest with the American people if I thought there was any health problem, anything that would keep me from being able to do the job,\" Biden told PBS NewsHour. \"And, so we'll see. But, you know, I just — I think people have to just watch me.\"\n\nWhite House dismisses concerns about Biden's age\n\nRepublicans have already gone after his age.\n\nDelivering the GOP response to Biden’s State of the Union address last week, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted she’s the nation’s youngest governor while Biden is “the oldest president in American history.”\n\nNikki Haley, who entered the Republican presidential race this week, is calling for \"mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.\"\n\n\"When people send someone to Washington, they need to know they’re at the top of their game,\" Haley told Fox News Thursday.\n\nHaley is pushing for a new generation of leaders, an argument that works against both Biden and former President Donald Trump, 76.\n\nAsked about Haley's comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed to what Biden has accomplished as president, including defying expectations in the midterm elections.\n\n\"It is surprising that we get this question when you look at the record of this president,\" she said. \"He’s clearly capable in so many ways and on so many levels. And he’s going to continue to do that in the years coming.”\n\nStill, half of registered voters think later middle age, between 51 and 65 years old, is the ideal age for a president, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll taken at the end of last year.\n\nAn additional 25% picked earlier middle age, 35 to 50 years old. Less than 1 percent said their ideal president would be 80 or older.\n\nJean-Pierre said scheduling difficulties prevented Thursday's physical from happening sooner.\n\n'Happy birthday, Mr. President':Biden turns 80 amid questions about a reelection bid\n\nRelated:Republican Nikki Haley calls for 'a new generation' - preferably her - in her first 2024 campaign rally\n\nMore:Joe Biden boxes Republicans into a corner on Social Security, Medicare with an eye on 2024", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/biden-trump-polling-2024-race-analysis/index.html", "title": "Americans may get the one presidential race the country doesn't ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s one tiny sliver of hope for Joe Biden in a devastating new poll that flags rising concerns over the President’s age and performance and shows even most Democrats want another candidate in 2024. He could still beat Donald Trump.\n\nThis small consolation for the White House cannot disguise growing signs that Biden’s presidency is in deep trouble even before midterm elections in November, which threaten a devastating rebuke to his Democratic Party in the House. The New York Times/Siena College nationwide survey coincides with a flurry of unflattering stories about Biden’s age and political proficiency and growing speculation about his prospects for reelection. The question of whether any Democrats would dare challenge him in a primary is an increasingly hot topic despite dismissals by leading alternative potential candidates.\n\nAnd yet, Biden, saddled with an approval rating of just 33% in the survey, is still in the game against Trump. The survey showed no clear leader, with Biden earning 44% to Trump’s 41% among registered voters, within the poll’s margin of sampling error.\n\nThe poll also shows that Trump would not be the unanimous choice inside his own party. Nearly half of Republican primary voters preferred another candidate for the nomination. That’s especially the case for primary voters under 35 and those with at least a college degree, majorities of which indicated they’d oppose Trump, according to the Times. Of all the names tested, however, Trump remained the favorite for the GOP nod by a wide margin.\n\nA poll is just a snapshot in time, but it’s hardly encouraging news for the ex-President and suggests he has huge liabilities in the general electorate, despite expectations among his conservative media boosters that he would cruise to revenge over an elderly Biden in 2024.\n\nBut the closeness of the hypothetical Biden-Trump matchup also points to a more profound theme that is emerging as the US barrels toward 2024 and has implications beyond the identity of the person who sits in the Oval Office in 2025. A country mired in multiple crises, politically estranged within and facing risky international flashpoints may get a 2024 contest between two candidates whose answers haven’t worked over the previous eight years and whom millions of people would like to see retire from the stage to make room for younger, fresher faces.\n\nSuch a scenario would be an indictment of a party system that is already fused into dysfunction by hyper partisanship and Trump’s attack on the 2020 election. It would likely leave the victor in 2024 without a workable mandate at a time when Washington is failing to respond to the country’s longer-term needs. And it would further strain faith among voters about the political system.\n\nA defining feature of a 2024 campaign\n\nA country where the passing of a political torch has been a strident feature of presidential races for generations could be about to endure one last slugfest between 1940s babies trying to defy time.\n\nBut paradoxically, a President who most of his own party wants to retire and an ex-President who left office in deep disgrace, could be exceedingly difficult to dislodge. The prospect of a November 2024 contest between a man who would be just shy of 82 and a 78-year-old former insurrectionist-in-chief is very real.\n\nBiden is a proud man. He waited a lifetime to win the presidency, and resented being overlooked in favor of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for earlier Democratic nominations. His team is adamant he is running for reelection and he has the best talking point – he already beat Trump and deserves a chance to repeat it.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is itching to launch a revenge campaign, associates have told CNN, even before November’s midterms. He may want to leap in to freeze out potential GOP rivals, capitalize on Biden’s low approval ratings and portray any potential criminal referral from the House select committee investigating his coup attempt as a naked political ploy.\n\nAny attempt from inside the Democratic and Republican Parties to push either candidate out could backfire, and might require challengers to put their own political futures on the line to do so – diminishing the likelihood of truly contested primary races. The chances of either Biden or Trump giving up on a race for the good of their parties this far out seems slim, though events and health questions could still reshape the future of the two rivals.\n\nBiden’s diminished presidency\n\nBiden’s presidency has been in free-fall for nearly a year, since the messy and bloody US withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer and his overtaken vow last July Fourth that the coronavirus pandemic was all but over. Both undermined his self-assigned job description as America’s fixer.\n\nIt’s not just independent and cross-over Republicans who have lost in faith in Biden. His support in his own party is plummeting too, according to the Times poll, which shows more than 60% of Democrats preferring an alternative nominee in 2024. Those who want a change cite Biden’s age and job performance as the top two reasons why. This is a flashing warning sign for the President.\n\nIf Democrats do poorly in the midterms, where they are widely expected to lose the House but may cling to the Senate, the calls for a fresh face at the top of the ticket 2024 ticket will surely grow. CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere has spent recent days chronicling disquiet among Democrats about their President but he found a unified front from key party figures who warn an anti-Biden movement could let a Republican win in 2024. No one needs reminding how Sen. Edward Kennedy’s challenge in 1980 fatally weakened President Jimmy Carter – a one-term predecessor to whom Biden is increasingly compared – and heralded 12 years of Republicans in the Oval Office. But a cataclysmic midterm election will increase pressure on Biden exponentially.\n\nCNN report: This is why Democrats are frustrated with Biden 04:45 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile the White House dismisses questions about the next election as media speculation, chatter about Biden’s age and prospects is growing among Democratic voters and a wider swathe of Americans outside the presidential bubble. Given that Biden was the oldest ever President the second he was sworn in, the issue of his age was always going to come up. His political troubles have perhaps just advanced the conversation. Incidents like the one recently when Biden fell off his bike, which could happen to any President, get far more coverage given his age. And it’s undeniable that the President is not the sprightly, backslapping, quintessential politician of even his vice presidential years. He’s perceptibly aged in office. It’s his misfortune that despite regular workouts and a physician’s report that he’s fit to serve, he must endure incessant public scrutiny. But that does come with the job.\n\nThe White House must brace for constant questions about Biden’s future plans, Democratic strategist James Carville told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “It’s not going to go away. I suspect that they don’t much like this story, but they are going to have to deal with it,” said Carville, who masterminded Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday insisted Biden was focused on the present not the future. “Polls are going to go up and they’re going to go down,” she said. “This is not the thing that we are solely focused on.”\n\nHow Biden could turn it around\n\nBiden’s problems among Democratic voters may reflect the divided nature of his party – and even his own success in 2020. His victory in the Democratic primary was forged as he ran as a statesmanlike voice for a quiet majority of moderates in a party with an increasingly youthful and progressive base.\n\nBut that electorally successful coalition has proven to be a governing liability in many cases. Despite early achievements like passing a big Covid-19 relief bill, cutting child poverty and signing a bipartisan infrastructure law, hopes for a Lyndon Johnson era of progressive reform have foundered to the frustration of House progressives furious that moderate senators like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin curtailed Biden’s agenda. An unlikely late push to enact some big wins, like social and climate spending, before the midterms could enthuse Democratic voters and improve Biden’s prospects. But there have been signs in recent weeks that raise fresh alarm – including the White House’s flat-footed initial response to the Supreme Court’s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion, which followed a draft conservative majority opinion published by Politico weeks earlier.\n\nThe White House stumble over abortion also sparked questions about the dexterity of the Biden operation with a reelection campaign looming after the midterms. Running for president as President brings a whole new set of challenges unfamiliar from a first campaign. The commander-in-chief is torn between his duties in the United States and abroad and often exhausting cross-country campaigning. It’s hard for any president to keep up, let alone one who will be 81 during the election year. This is why some strategists still think that Biden will eventually look at his prospects for 2024 and decide against running again. It would be painfully ironic if he emulates Johnson, not with the scope of his domestic reform program but with a decision not to seek reelection after a full first term amidst cratering political prospects.\n\nYet Biden has one card to play with Democrats that could change everything. An early campaign launch by Trump would allow the President to yet again start drawing a sharper contrast with a potential alternative who is viewed with horror by almost all Democrats – and many more Americans.\n\nThe New York Times survey, for example, found that if the choice in 2024 was between Biden and Trump, 92% of Democrats would stick with the President.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/exit-polls-midterm-election-analysis/index.html", "title": "Exit polls: High inflation dominates voters' views in the midterm ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSoaring prices were top of mind for voters as they cast ballots in this year’s midterm elections, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nNearly a third of voters said inflation was the issue that mattered most in deciding how they voted for House candidates. And more than 7 in 10 of them opted for Republicans.\n\nInflation also dominated in most of the exit polls conducted in 11 key states. At least two-thirds of those concerned about high prices in several crucial states cast ballots for Republican Senate candidates.\n\nConsumers have been contending with soaring prices for food, gas and other essentials for more than a year as inflation has hovered around 40-year highs.\n\nAround three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.\n\nVoters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”\n\nThe exit poll results are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy.\n\nThough President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have tried to tout the measures they’ve taken to lower costs, many voters aren’t giving them credit. Just under half of voters for House candidates said Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only around one-third said they are helping, exit polls found.\n\nEven Biden’s plan to forgive some student loan debt has not rustled up widespread support. Roughly half of voters approve of the effort, while nearly the same share disapprove.\n\nDespite voters’ angst about the economy, the Republicans’ red wave does not seem to have fully materialized. Abortion was also a significant factor in the election, with more than a quarter of voters listing it as a top issue. About 61% said they were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and about 7 in 10 of those voters backed a Democratic House candidate.\n\nHere are more takeaways from CNN’s preliminary 2022 national and state exit polls.\n\nVoters who valued ‘honesty and integrity’ favored Fetterman\n\nPennsylvania voters who most valued “honesty and integrity” in their Senate candidate favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz, according to the early results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman also won among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cared about people like them, while Oz won among the smaller bloc of voters who prioritized a candidate sharing their values.\n\nCNN projects that Fetterman will defeat Oz to win the open Pennsylvania Senate race, flipping a Republican-held seat.\n\nA majority of female voters, White college-educated voters, voters of color and political independents in the state supported Fetterman, the exit poll finds, while most male voters and White voters without college degrees supported Oz.\n\nMost voters, about 53%, said they disapproved of President Joe Biden’s job performance. But roughly 14% of those who disapproved of Biden cast their ballots for Fetterman, as did nearly all of those who approved of the president. A slim majority of voters in the state said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, with most also saying former President Donald Trump did not play a role.\n\nVoters were close to evenly split on whether or not Oz’s views were too extreme, while about 53% said Fetterman’s views were not.\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania were closely split over whether Fetterman’s health was good enough to represent the state effectively. Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Oz has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\n2:05 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy and Tami Luhby\n\nMost voters don’t want Biden to run in 2024\n\nMore than two-thirds of voters for House candidates don’t want President Joe Biden to run for reelection in 2024, according to the early results of the national exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 independent voters and roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters said they don’t want Biden to be in the 2024 presidential campaign. Fewer than 6 in 10 Democratic voters thought he should run.\n\nJust under 6 in 10 independent voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, and about the same share disapprove of the job he’s doing as president.\n\nOnly 1 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of the president and slightly more disapprove of his job performance.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 GOP voters have an unfavorable view of Biden and disapprove of the job he’s doing.\n\nWhen it comes to former President Donald Trump, two-thirds of independent voters and more than 9 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of him. Just over three-quarters of GOP voters have a favorable view.\n\nIndependent voters comprise about a quarter of the electorate, while Democratic voters are roughly one-third and Republican voters are just over one-third of the electorate.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nVance draws support from suburban and rural voters, as well as from men, White voters and older voters\n\nNearly 6 in 10 suburban voters and nearly the same share of rural voters favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, US Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to preliminary results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAlso, nearly 6 in 10 men who cast ballots voted for Vance, about the same share as White voters who picked the GOP candidate. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older and voters without college degrees opted for Vance, as well.\n\nRyan was the preferred candidate of just over half of women who voted, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly half of independent voters cast ballots for the Democrat. Just under 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state.\n\nNearly 6 in 10 voters from union households voted for Ryan, according to the exit poll later on Wednesday morning. Initially, the exit poll had shown that about the same share supported Vance.\n\nVoters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan.\n\nVance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.\n\n1:15 p.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters saw Don Bolduc’s views as ‘too extreme’\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters called Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc’s views “too extreme,” according to the early results of the New Hampshire exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Only about 43% said the same of his Democratic rival, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan.\n\nCNN projects that Hassan will win a second Senate term in New Hampshire, defeating the Trump-backed Bolduc.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s job approval rating in the state is negative, per the exit poll, with only about 42% of voters approving. But roughly 1 in 5 Biden disapprovers, nevertheless, cast their vote for Hassan.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of voters in the state – including similar shares of both candidates’ supporters – said that party control of the Senate was very important to their vote.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMost voters express at least some confidence in fairness of elections in their states\n\nNationally, more than 9 in 10 Democrats who voted in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state were being conducted fairly and accurately, according to early national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. That’s a level of confidence shared by about 8 in 10 independents, and a smaller two-thirds of Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats’ confidence was robust across most key battleground states, Republicans’ views of the election system varied much more significantly by state.\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 Republicans in Florida, New Hampshire, Texas and Ohio said they were confident that their state’s elections were accurate and fair, as did more than 7 in 10 in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nBut only about 6 in 10 Republicans in Michigan, Nevada and Arizona said they were confident in their state’s elections. And in Pennsylvania, only about half expressed such confidence.\n\nVoters were also deeply concerned about the state of the country’s democracy. About 3 in 10 said that they viewed democracy in the US today as at least somewhat secure, with about two-thirds feeling that democracy in the country is somewhat or very threatened.\n\nSlightly over 6 in 10 voters accepted that Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020, while slightly over one-third denied the results of that election.\n\nUpdated 11:39 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters who disliked both parties broke for Republicans\n\nMost voters in this year’s election view one party positively, and the other negatively – nationally, about 4 in 10 have a favorable view of only the Democratic Party, and a similar share have a favorable view of only the Republican Party, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Unsurprisingly, these voters almost unanimously supported their favored party in their district’s congressional election.\n\nBut there’s also a smaller bloc of voters – about 11% of the electorate, nationwide – who dislike both parties. This group broke in favor of the Republicans, with nearly 6 in 10 favoring a GOP House candidate this year. That’s a shift from 2018, when voters who disliked both parties were about evenly split in their vote.\n\nVoters who were most upset with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade differed from those who felt less profoundly unhappy with the decision, the exit polls show. Those who were angry about the overturning of Roe (about 39% of the electorate) overwhelmingly voted Democratic for the House (about 85% picked the Democratic candidate). Those who were dissatisfied but not angry (about 21% of the electorate) narrowly favored the GOP.\n\nThere was also a difference between voters who were most pessimistic about the economy, and those who felt less strongly negative. While nearly 9 in 10 voters who said the economy was poor voted for a GOP House candidate, about 6 in 10 who described the economy as “not so good” backed a Democratic candidate.\n\nTo some extent, these divides reflect the partisan differences already baked into views on abortion and the economy. Voters who considered themselves Democrats were roughly 59 points more than voters who considered themselves Republican to say they were angry about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, were about 28 points likelier than Democrats to call the economy poor.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nFlorida voters weigh in on Trump and DeSantis\n\nWhat do Florida voters think about the possibility two Florida men could run for president in 2024? Exit polls from the Sunshine State offer some clues.\n\nWith Donald Trump signaling a potential announcement next week, 33% of Florida voters said they want to see the former president run in 2024, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThere appears to be more of an appetite for a bid by Ron DeSantis, with 45% of Florida voters saying they want the state’s governor – who CNN projects will win reelection – to seek the presidency in 2024.\n\nDeSantis’ strength is reflected in the Florida exit polls, which show the governor winning Latinos in the state by 13 points. In 2020, Trump trailed Biden among Latino voters in Florida by 7 points. DeSantis also held a slight edge among independents, whom Biden carried in the state by 11 points. Those could be selling points if DeSantis and Trump collide in a 2024 GOP primary.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Terence Burlij\n\nPennsylvania voters are split over Fetterman’s health\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman’s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before he won the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had.\n\nOz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\nVoters also split over which candidate’s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz.\n\nMore than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most.\n\nMen and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman.\n\nFor voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate.\n\nBut among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.\n\n8:44 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVast majority of North Carolina voters think the economy is not in good shape\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 North Carolina voters said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” according to the preliminary results of the North Carolina Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in the state said inflation has caused them and their family severe or moderate hardship.\n\nAbout half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only 35% think they are helping.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 North Carolina voters approve of Biden, while more than half disapprove.\n\n8:19 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nOhio voters think the economy is weak\n\nMore than three-quarters of Ohio voters said the nation’s economy was “poor” or “not so good,” according to the preliminary results of the Ohio Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAnd nearly three-quarters of Buckeye State voters said inflation has caused their family severe or moderate hardship, with nearly 2 in 10 saying their difficulties were severe.\n\nMore than half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting, while about one-third said they are helping.\n\nThe president is not that popular among Ohio voters – more than half disapprove of him, with more than 4 in 10 approving.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock loses some support among Black and Hispanic Georgians\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday’s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThe votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close.\n\nRoughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found.\n\nWarnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens.\n\nStill, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots.\n\nA majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock.\n\nMore than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock holds edge among Georgia voters when it comes to showing ‘good judgment’\n\nGeorgia voters were more likely to say that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has good judgment than they were to say the same of his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, according to the preliminary results of the Georgia exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. But more said Warnock holds views that are too extreme than said the same about Walker.\n\nJust shy of half, about 46%, said only Warnock shows good judgment, with about 28% saying only Walker does, and nearly a fifth that neither candidate does.\n\nVoters in Georgia were close to evenly split on whether or not Warnock’s views were too extreme. Slightly more than 4 in 10 said Walker’s views were too extreme, with just over half saying they were not.\n\nAsked which candidate quality mattered most to their Senate vote, 36% of Georgia voters said they wanted a candidate who shared their values, 32% a candidate who had honesty and integrity, 19% a candidate who cared about people like them, and 8% someone who had the right experience.\n\n7:08 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nPennsylvania voters are not enamored with either Biden or Trump\n\nMore than 4 in 10 of Pennsylvania voters approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job, but a majority disapprove of the president, who was born and raised in Scranton, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nVoters in the commonwealth did not have a high opinion of former President Donald Trump either. Just 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion, while nearly 6 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, just over half of Pennsylvania voters said Biden was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the president was a factor, more than 1 in 10 said they support him, while nearly a third said they oppose him.\n\nMore than half of Pennsylvania voters also said that Trump was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the former president was a factor, close to 1 in 5 said they support him, while about a quarter oppose him.\n\n6:52 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoters trust Republicans more on inflation and crime but lean toward Democrats on abortion\n\nMore voters trust Republicans than Democrats to handle inflation and crime, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nRoughly half of voters said they trusted GOP candidates on those two issues, while more than 4 in 10 voters said they trusted Democratic candidates.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of abortion, however, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n6:30 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoter views on Trump are even more negative than on Biden\n\nWhile voters in this year’s midterm election hold negative views of President Joe Biden, their views of his predecessor are even more negative, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about 37% of voters in this year’s midterms expressed a favorable view of former President Donald Trump, with around 6 in 10 viewing him unfavorably. About 16% of voters said their House vote this year was intended to express support for Trump, with just under 3 in 10 saying it’s intended to express opposition and the rest saying that Trump was not a factor.\n\nVoters’ opinions of the GOP were slightly more positive than their views of Trump, with about 43% viewing the Republican Party favorably and just over half viewing it unfavorably. More than half, about 54%, say the GOP is too extreme.\n\n6:00 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters differ in their top issues\n\nThere’s a significant partisan divide in voters’ priorities and attitudes this year, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nNearly half of voters who supported a GOP House candidate called inflation their top issue, with fewer than 15% picking any other issue as their priority. Among voters who backed a Democratic candidate, about 44% called abortion their top issue, with 15% or fewer picking any other issue.\n\nMeanwhile, midterm voters were mostly opposed to the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the preliminary national exit polls.\n\nSlightly fewer than 4 in 10 said they felt enthusiastic or satisfied about the decision, while about 21% said they felt dissatisfied, and roughly 4 in 10 that they were angry.\n\nAbout 60% of all voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 51% among voters who turned out for the 2020 general election.\n\n5:52 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\n2022 voters may skew older compared with 2018\n\nEarly indications suggest that this year’s midterm electorate may look older than the voters in the 2018 midterms, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about a tenth of voters in this election were under age 30, while roughly one-third were age 65 or older. In 2018, about 13% were under 30, and about 26% were 65 or older.\n\nThe electorate this year was split roughly between those who generally identify as Democrats (about 34%) and those who generally identify as Republicans (about 35%), with the remainder consisting of political independents and members of other parties. In 2018, Democrats made up a slightly larger voting bloc, about 37%.\n\nAbout 76% of voters were White, and about 24% were voters of color. White voters with college degrees look to be a slightly larger share of the electorate this year – about 40% per the preliminary data, compared with 31% four years ago. By contrast, voters of color without a college degree look to have made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate this year.\n\n5:29 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nInflation is top issue for voters, followed by abortion\n\nInflation tops voters’ list of concerns in this year’s midterm elections, with abortion a close second, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nApproximately one-third called inflation the most important issue to their vote, with about 27% citing abortion. The remainder were roughly divided between picking crime, gun policy and immigration as their chief concerns.\n\nThe electorate’s views of the economy are largely gloomy. Only about one-quarter of voters felt positively about the current condition of the economy, with roughly three-quarters viewing it negatively – and about 4 in 10 saying it’s downright poor.\n\nThat’s more pessimistic than in the 2018 midterms, when 68% of voters said the state of the economy was excellent or good, and the 2020 presidential election, when 49% said the same.\n\nAbout 46% of voters in this election say that their family’s financial situation had worsened over the past two years, while only about 1 in 5 said it had improved.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in this year’s election say that inflation has caused hardship for them and their family over the past year, with about 20% saying it’s been a severe hardship. And about 6 in 10 say that gas prices, specifically, have recently been a hardship.\n\n5:23 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters unhappy with the state of the nation and largely negative on Biden\n\nVoters in this year’s midterm elections are broadly unhappy with the state of the nation and hold largely negative views of President Joe Biden, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 said they were less than satisfied with the way things are going in the country, with about one-third saying they were not just dissatisfied but angry with the state of the nation.\n\nBiden’s approval rating stands at about 45% among voters in this year’s election – nearly identical to then-Donald Trump’s 45% approval rating four years ago among 2018 midterm voters. And voters in this election were more than twice as likely to strongly disapprove of Biden as they were to strongly approve of him.\n\nJust shy of half of voters this year said that Biden’s policies are mostly hurting the country, with about 36% saying his policies are mostly helping, and the rest that they’re making no difference.\n\nMany voters didn’t see their congressional vote as a referendum on the president – close to half said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, while about 18% said their vote was to express support for Biden, and about one-third that it was to express opposition to him.\n\nUpdated 5:13 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 2022 national exit polls include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error – which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest exit poll numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results.\n\nCNN Exit Polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters.

By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together.

Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep.

The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine?

Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov.

Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.

And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen.

Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/midterm-elections-gop-us-house-races/index.html", "title": "Midterm elections 2022: How to tell if Republicans are heading for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe conditions are ripe for Republicans to win the US House of Representatives. So while Senate control is still up for grabs, the discussion on the House side has shifted to just how large a possible new GOP majority could be.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of five seats to win the chamber. They can get there just by picking up Democratic-held seats that former President Donald Trump won in 2020, plus others that shifted closer toward the GOP in redistricting.\n\nThey can pick up even more seats by winning in suburban areas that deserted the GOP during Trump’s presidency. Many of this year’s toss-up races are playing out in the suburbs, offering a key test of whether well-educated and more affluent voters who left the Republican Party in 2018 will come back now that Trump is out of the White House.\n\nThe backdrop to these individual races is a national environment that would appear to be a boon to the GOP. Even after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade injected a heavy dose of uncertainty into the political landscape this summer, the economy and inflation remain the most pressing concerns for voters, a dynamic that plays into Republican attacks on the party in power. Republicans also have history on their side, since a new president’s party often loses seats in the midterms – especially a president with approval ratings like Joe Biden’s.\n\nAll of those tailwinds are easier for the GOP to take advantage of in House races. Although these contests take place in 435 individual districts, they tend to be more nationalized affairs since candidates have less defined brands than senators.\n\nIn part because of those national conditions, Republicans are also targeting some districts that Biden would have won by double digits under the new lines. But that’s also a reflection of the gains they made in 2020; the GOP needs to reach even deeper into Biden territory to find Democratic-held seats they can go after. Underscoring Democrats’ defensive posture, 9 of the 10 House races seeing the most ad spending in the final week feature vulnerable incumbent Democrats.\n\nDemocratic retirements opened new opportunities across the map, including in places such as Rhode Island, giving House Republicans another viable district to try to regain a foothold in New England after being wiped out in 2018. Those open seats are harder for Democrats to defend because they generally require outside groups to spend more than they would have had to with an incumbent in the race raising money.\n\nNationally, redistricting benefited House Republicans overall, though things turned out better for Democrats than expected – just not everywhere. In fact, Republicans have chances to flip all the races they’d need to win the House in two blue states alone – Oregon and New York – thanks to a combination of new maps and open seats.\n\nTo win the House majority, however, Republicans need to hold most of their own seats. That requires defending seats Democrats are targeting, including those that became bluer in redistricting.\n\nHere are some key House races to keep an eye on that could determine whether Republicans win the majority – and, assuming they do, the kinds of races that may signal just how much of a “red wave” is cresting over Washington. Race ratings come from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. This list is by no means exhaustive and may be updated as we get closer to Election Day.\n\nThe freebie districts\n\nThese are seats that the GOP should be winning easily because they shifted so much toward Republicans in redistricting that they’re barely competitive. In some of them, the Democratic incumbent either retired or is running in a different district.\n\nTennessee’s 5th District (Likely Republican)\n\nTennessee Rep. Jim Cooper, a 16-term member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, decided against running for reelection after state Republicans redrew his Nashville-area district into one that clearly favors the GOP. The previous version had voted for Biden by nearly 24 points, but Trump would have won the new version by 11 points.\n\nFlorida’s 7th District (Likely Republican)\n\nDemocrats are losing another moderate Blue Dog member in Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a member of the January 6 committee who’s not running for reelection. It’s harder for Democrats to defend this seat, north of Orlando, without Murphy, a strong incumbent with a compelling personal story as the first Vietnamese American woman to serve in Congress. And it’s even harder in a district that got more Republican, with the new version shifting about 15 points toward Trump.\n\nGeorgia’s 6th District (Likely Republican)\n\nThis suburban Atlanta seat was also redrawn by Republicans to be significantly redder – so much so that Rep. Lucy McBath opted to take on a fellow Democratic incumbent – and won the primary – in the neighboring 7th District, leaving this seat open. Trump would have won the new 6th District by 15 points.\n\nTexas’ 38th District (Solid Republican)\n\nThe GOP redraw of Texas’ congressional map significantly reduced the number of competitive districts, and Republicans have a prime pickup opportunity in this new Houston-area seat that Trump would have won by 18 points. Republican Wesley Hunt – a favorite GOP recruit who lost a bid for a different seat to Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 – is heavily favored in the new district. Hunt’s victory could increase the number of Black Republicans in the House.\n\nThe nearly surrendered districts\n\nThese are the kinds of districts that either shifted away from Democrats in redistricting or that they just don’t have enough money to defend – perhaps because they’re open seats or because outside groups need the money elsewhere. This list isn’t exhaustive, but Republican should be able to pick up some of these seats – and if they’re not, they may not be in for as good as a night as they’d hoped.\n\nArizona’s 2nd District (Lean Republican)\n\nRepublicans feel good about this largely rural district in northeastern Arizona because it got much tougher for three-term Rep. Tom O’Halleran. (Trump would have won it by 8 points, while Biden won O’Halleran’s current seat by about 2 points.) The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a late investment in the race in October.\n\nWisconsin’s 3rd District (Lean Republican)\n\nThis is an open seat Republicans are favored to pick up. Democratic Rep. Ron Kind won reelection in 2020 while Trump was carrying the district by about 5 points, making Kind one of the relatively few House lawmakers to represent a district won by the presidential nominee of the opposing party. That already made the seat a top GOP target, but then Kind announced last summer that he wasn’t running for reelection. Republican Derrick Van Orden, whom Kind narrowly defeated in 2020, is running again. Van Orden attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, but has said he never entered the Capitol.\n\nTexas’ 15th District (Lean Republican)\n\nThis is one of three Rio Grande Valley districts at play this year that will test whether Republicans can deepen their inroads with Hispanic voters in South Texas. It’s an open seat because Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez is running for a different, more favorable seat after redistricting made the 15th District more competitive for Republicans. And national Democrats have already directed spending to other races, suggesting Republican Monica De La Cruz, whom Gonzalez narrowly defeated in 2020, has the edge against progressive Democrat Michelle Vallejo in a redrawn seat that Trump would have carried by 3 points.\n\nMichigan’s 10th District (Lean Republican)\n\nMichigan lost a seat in reapportionment. Rep. Andy Levin’s decision to unsuccessfully take on a fellow Democratic incumbent in a neighboring seat left Democrats without an incumbent running in the 10th District in suburban Detroit. Trump would have won the new 10th District, which is rooted in Macomb County, by just 1 point. Republican John James – who lost two recent bids for US Senate in the Wolverine State – is a strong fundraiser and well positioned to win this race.\n\nThe better-than-last-time battlegrounds\n\nThese are battleground districts that voted narrowly for Trump or Biden and are expected to see close races. But these seats may be more favorable to Republicans because of how they were redrawn or because of the specific candidate matchups. Democrats flipped many of these seats in the 2018 blue wave, making the districts natural GOP targets in a more favorable national environment. Again, this list isn’t exhaustive, but these are the kinds of districts Republicans should be winning if they’re having a decently good night.\n\nIowa’s 3rd District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis Des Moines-area seat shifted ever so slightly toward Trump in redistricting. It typifies a middle-of-the-road district where the tension between Democratic messaging on abortion and Republican messaging on inflation is at a head. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne is running for a third term against Republican state Sen. Zach Nunn, an Air Force veteran. Nunn is one of the rare Republicans to mention abortion on the airwaves, trying to flip the Democrats’ narrative about whose position is extreme.\n\nVirginia’s 2nd District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis is another suburban seat Democrats flipped in 2018. Two years later, Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria won a rematch against former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor. But this time, she has a new opponent in Jen Kiggans, a fellow Navy veteran who cuts a remarkably similar profile in this military-heavy district anchored in Virginia Beach. The district got slightly better for Republicans in redistricting – Biden carried the previous version by 5 points and would have won by 2 points under the new lines.\n\nNew Jersey’s 7th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nAnother member of the class of 2018, Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, is running in more challenging terrain that now includes more of the rural northwestern part of the state, in addition to the well-educated and affluent New York City suburbs that helped him flip the seat in the Trump era. (The district is also home to Trump’s Bedminster golf club.) The new district would have backed Biden by 4 points, a drop from his 10-point victory margin under the previous lines. Malinowski faces a rematch with former state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., whom he barely beat in 2020 and whose father was a popular governor.\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District (Toss-up)\n\nAnother House rematch got tougher for Democrats when this eastern Pennsylvania district shifted from one that had backed Biden by 5 points to one that would have backed him by half a point. Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, another incumbent first elected in 2018, is up against Republican Lisa Scheller, whom she narrowly defeated in 2020.\n\nThe knife’s edge battlegrounds\n\nThese are Democratic-held seats – many of them in suburban areas – that could go either way, but if Republicans are winning these kinds of seats, not all of which are listed here, they’ll be having a very good night. (Of course, Republicans have battlegrounds they have to defend too. Skip to the end for more on those.)\n\nWashington’s 8th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kim Schrier – the only female physician in the House – is running for a third term against Republican Matt Larkin. The redrawn district, which includes areas just outside Seattle and Tacoma, would have voted for Biden by 7 points. In a sign of Democrats’ defensive posture on crime and policing this year, Schrier has been trying to stress her independence and tout her ties to law enforcement in her paid advertising, while painting her opponent as “dangerous” for his views on abortion. Larkin has argued that the Democrat “can’t be trusted to keep us safe” and that she votes with Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOregon’s 5th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis is an open seat because Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, a moderate Blue Dog member who was Biden’s first congressional endorsee of the cycle, lost his primary earlier this year to progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, is trying to flip the redrawn district in the Portland and Bend suburbs, which Biden would have won by 8 points. Republicans are going after the Democrat for her previous political work in California, while she’s hitting back with an ad featuring the former Bend chief of police refuting attacks that she supports defunding the police. Regardless of how this race goes, it’ll be a chance for women to grow their ranks in the House.\n\nOregon’s 6th District (Toss-up)\n\nState Democrats drew this new seat south of Portland, which Biden would have won by 13 points, as an easy pickup for their party. But Republican Mike Erickson – who lost a 2008 challenge to Schrader – is leaning into classic GOP attack lines trying to tie his Democratic opponent, state Rep. Andrea Salinas, to high inflation and spending in Washington, DC. Republicans are also running a misleading ad campaign accusing Salinas of voting to defund the police. (As a CNN fact check notes, none of the three bills the ad cites actually defunded the police.) Democratic ads highlight that Salinas is the daughter of a police officer.\n\nNevada’s 3rd District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nThis district, located south and west of Las Vegas, will test the resonance of the GOP’s economic message, even in a seat that got more Democratic in redistricting. (Biden would have carried the redrawn 3rd District by about 7 points compared with less than half a point under the old lines.) Republican April Becker, who ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2020, is talking about Washington spending and inflation as she tries to unseat Democratic Rep. Susie Lee. The two-term congresswoman is trying to brand Becker as “way too extreme” – pointing to everything from abortion to the Republican’s actions around the 2020 election (Becker alleged there was voter fraud in her 2020 loss and sought a new election). Becker says she’s against a national abortion ban, but that isn’t stopping Democrats from attacking her as someone supported by those who want a ban.\n\nColorado’s 8th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nColorado added this seat north of Denver, which Biden would have won by less than 5 points, following reapportionment after the 2020 census. Democratic groups spent a relatively small amount trying to elevate a more conservative Republican in the primary, but state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer emerged as the nominee against Democratic state Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician. Both sides are attacking each other over their records in the state legislature. This race, which has shifted from a “Toss-up” toward Republicans in the final stretch, will be a test of the appeal of Republicans in the suburbs and among some Hispanic voters. And whichever way this new seat goes, it’s a chance to elect another woman to the House.\n\nThe tougher battlegrounds\n\nThese are among some of the strongest battle-tested Democratic incumbents, many with significant resources. If Republicans are winning these seats, they’re having a very good night.\n\nMaine’s 2nd District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nRep. Jared Golden, one of the few Democrats to represent a district Trump carried twice, is about to see whether a Democrat with his own brand can buck the national environment. A Marine veteran first elected in 2018, Golden has voted against many of his party’s priorities in Washington, DC, with the recent health care, climate and tax package being a notable exception. But he’s up against a known commodity and strong fundraiser in former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whose 2018 defeat eliminated the last Republican in the House from New England. But as in that race four years ago, ranked-choice voting makes the race difficult to predict.\n\nAlaska’s At-Large District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRanked-choice voting will also likely be in play in Alaska’s At-Large District, which had been in GOP hands for nearly 50 years before Democrats flipped it in a special election this summer with a focus on abortion rights. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola became the first Alaska Native in Congress, but she’ll face former Gov. Sarah Palin, among others, again in November. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who’s up for reelection this year, has said she plans to rank Peltola first on her ballot.\n\nPennsylvania’s 8th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Matt Cartwright is another incumbent used to running in Trump territory, although the redrawn version of his northeastern Pennsylvania district would have voted for the former President by a slightly smaller margin (3 points) in 2020 – compared with 5 points under the previous lines. The five-term congressman faces a rematch against Republican Jim Bognet, whom he narrowly defeated two years ago in a district that includes Biden’s hometown of Scranton. Cartwright’s ads speak to his challenge – appealing to Trump voters in a national environment that favors Republicans. One spot features a Biden voter and Trump voter explaining that their support for the congressman is the only thing they can agree on.\n\nVirginia’s 7th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, is one of many members of the class of 2018 – particularly those with national security backgrounds – who are top GOP targets this cycle. And though her district became bluer in redistricting, she’s tried to distance herself from national Democrats. (She is running ads touting the endorsement of a former GOP congressman and a Republican police officer, for example.) She may also benefit from running against Republican Yesli Vega, who’s been painted as too conservative for this district, which now extends to some of the suburbs around Washington, DC. Still, the national environment is keeping this one close, and the race is among those attracting the most ad spending – more than $26 million since Labor Day.\n\nMichigan’s 7th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nAnother high-profile member of that group of national security Democrats is Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who flipped a GOP-held Michigan district in 2018 and went on to win reelection in 2020 while Trump was narrowly carrying her seat. Slotkin is running this year in a district that split just about evenly in the 2020 presidential contest. The race has drawn more than $30 million in ad spending just since Labor Day, according to AdImpact data. Republicans should normally be able to ride the national tailwinds in such a district, but Slotkin is known to be a hardworking incumbent with a massive war chest. She entered October with nearly $4 million compared with $115,000 for Republican challenger Tom Barrett, who blames Biden and Slotkin for higher fuel costs. Sporting a “Dad” T-shirt in one recent spot, the state senator talks about how expensive it is to fuel up his family’s minivan. Slotkin is touting Democrats’ efforts to allow Medicare to negotiate certain drug costs, tying it to her own experience of watching her mom struggle with costs when she had cancer. Slotkin received an endorsement Thursday from Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who said she will also campaign with the Democrat.\n\nMichigan’s 8th District (Lean Democratic)\n\nFive-term Rep. Dan Kildee – a well-known name in the state after he succeeded his uncle in Congress – isn’t used to having competitive races. He won reelection in 2020 by nearly 13 points. But his redrawn district would have backed Biden by just 2 points, and that has made him a top GOP target. Kildee is up against Republican Paul Junge, who lost to Slotkin in the previous version of the 8th District in 2020. The National Republican Congressional Committee launched an ad that attempted to tie the incumbent to the Biden White House’s initial insistence that inflation was “transitory.” Junge has also claimed that Kildee is backed by groups who want to defund the police, but as a CNN fact check noted, he’s explicitly rejected that idea. Kildee is using a sheriff on camera to defend his record.\n\nMinnesota’s 2nd District (Toss-up)\n\nMinnesota is an especially potent place for police messaging after George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis led to protests and an unsuccessful 2021 ballot initiative to overhaul policing in the city. But Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, who flipped this district south of the Twin Cities in 2018, has responded to the GOP attacks with an ad featuring a sheriff who says the Democrat stood up to her own party and opposed that ballot measure. While GOP nominee Tyler Kistner has tried to attack the incumbent on inflation and crime, Craig has a significant financial advantage that could help her overcome a national environment unfavorable to Democrats.\n\nNew Hampshire’s 1st District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nNational Republicans seemed to think they would have had a better shot with 2020 nominee Matt Mowers taking on Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas again, but Mowers lost the September primary to Karoline Leavitt, a fellow former Trump administration official. Leavitt has more fully embraced Trump and his false rhetoric about a stolen election, which could alienate some of the voters Republicans would normally need to win in New Hampshire. (Biden would have won the district by about 6 points.) If she wins, Leavitt could become one of the first members of Generation Z – those born after 1996 – elected to Congress.\n\nTexas’ 28th District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar – the lone House Democrat who votes against abortion rights – is trying to hold on to a Rio Grande Valley district where Republicans are looking to make inroads with Latino voters. After fending off the same progressive primary challenger for the second cycle in a row, Cuellar now faces Republican Cassy Garcia in a district that would have backed Biden by 7 points. Republicans have tried to make Cuellar out to be a creature of Washington – with one ad even suggesting he’s living like a “king” – while also pointing to an FBI search of his home as part of an investigation in which the Democrat has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNew York’s 17th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the party’s House campaign arm, is locked in a tight race with Republican state Assemblyman Mike Lawler. Biden would have won this redrawn Lower Hudson Valley district by roughly 10 points, so victory for Lawler and Republicans, who have spent big on the campaign, would suggest more Democratic losses to come on election night. The same goes for the state’s 3rd and 4th Districts on Long Island. The seats opened up when Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice opted to retire and Rep. Tom Suozzi launched an unsuccessful primary challenge to Gov. Kathy Hochul. Democrats Robert Zimmerman (in the 3rd District) and Laura Gillen (in the 4th District) have been hit hard by their Republican opponents on crime and inflation. If they fall, many Democratic strategists say, the party’s House majority is almost sure to follow.\n\nBracing for a GOP landslide\n\nThese are the kinds of seats where Republican victories would suggest they’re having a really good night and building a very significant majority in the House. Inside Elections moved its ratings for five of these six races to be less safe for Democrats in the final week before the election.\n\nIndiana’s 1st District (Lean Democratic)\n\nThis northwestern Indiana district has been trending toward Republicans – and they’re targeting it this year with a strong recruit in Iraq War veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green, who could diversity the ranks of the House GOP. She had outraised Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan by the end of September and began October with more money in the bank. Biden would have won this traditionally Democratic district by 8 points, but even if it doesn’t flip, the margin here on election night could say a lot about how rough a night Democrats could be in for.\n\nRhode Island’s 2nd District (Toss-up) and Connecticut’s 5th District (Toss-up)\n\nBesides Maine’s 2nd District, Republicans’ best opportunities to win back seats in New England are in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin’s retirement created an open western Rhode Island seat that Biden would have won by 14 points. (For comparison, he would have won the state’s neighboring 1st District by 29 points.) Republicans have a strong recruit in the 2nd District in former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who didn’t have a primary and is well known in the area. Democrat Seth Magaziner, the state treasurer, emerged handily from the mid-September primary but has had a shorter runway to pivot to the general election. Connecticut’s 5th District, by contrast, is not an open seat, so it may be a slightly harder one for Republicans to peel off. Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes, who was first elected in 2018, faces Republican former state Sen. George Logan. But both races have shifted from favoring Democrats to toss-ups in the final weeks.\n\nCalifornia’s 47th and 49th districts (Tilt Democratic)\n\nA cluster of races out West could also signal that Republicans are having a huge night. They’re targeting Democratic Reps. Mike Levin in California’s 49th’s District and Katie Porter in California’s 47th, both of which Biden would have carried by 11 points. Both seats moved away from Democrats in the final stretch, with Inside Elections shifting their rating from “Lean Democratic” to “Tilt” – the narrowest degree of Democratic favorability.\n\nOregon’s 4th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Peter DeFazio is leaving behind an open seat, which Republican Alek Skarlatos, whom DeFazio beat by about 5 points in 2020, is running for again. But the seat got more Democratic in redistricting this year and would have backed Biden by nearly 13 points. Still, Inside Elections also moved this away from Democrats slightly in the final days of the campaign.\n\nRepublicans on defense\n\nIt’s not all offensive targets for the House GOP. They also need to defend their own seats, and each one they lose is one they’d have to gain elsewhere to advance toward the majority. These are just a few examples of the districts they’re defending.\n\nOhio’s 1st District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocrats have targeted Republican Rep. Steve Chabot for years. But this year, the district lines are much more favorable for them – Biden would have carried the redrawn version of this Cincinnati-area district by about 9 points, whereas Trump narrowly carried the previous version. Democrats are attacking Chabot over his opposition to abortion rights, while the congressman is leaning into economic messaging about inflation, arguing that voters “can’t afford” his Democratic opponent, Greg Landsman. Republicans have also tried to tie Landsman, a member of the Cincinnati City Council, to the movement to defund the police. (Landsman has his own ad with uniformed officers disputing that attack.)\n\nCalifornia’s 22nd District (Toss-up)\n\nRep. David Valadao is one of only two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year who is on the ballot this fall. The other lawmakers either called it quits or were defeated in their primaries. In a rare move for the former President, Trump did not endorse against the congressman, but Valadao still drew a challenge from his right in the June top-two primary. He advanced to the general election with Democratic Assemblymember Rudy Salas but faces a tough race in a district Biden would have carried by 13 points.\n\nCalifornia’s 27th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nGOP Rep. Mike Garcia is in another rematch with Democrat Christy Smith after defeating her in a 2020 special election and the regular general election later that year. He benefits from a favorable national environment this year, even in a Los Angeles-area district that Biden would have won by about 12 points.\n\nNebraska’s 2nd District (Toss-up)\n\nThis suburban Omaha seat has been a perennial target for Democrats after Republican Don Bacon flipped it in 2016 as Trump was narrowly carrying it. But Biden won it four years later by 7 points (and would have carried the redrawn version by a similar 6-point margin). Now the three-term congressman is up against state Sen. Tony Vargas in a race that will test the GOP’s post-Trump strength in the suburbs.\n\nTexas’ 34th District (Toss-up)\n\nRepublicans are on defense in this Rio Grande Valley seat after Mayra Flores won the special election in June to fill a vacancy in the old version of the seat. That made her the first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress. But Flores now faces Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in a redrawn district that got much more Democratic in redistricting. (Biden won the previous version of the district by about 4 points but would have carried it by about 16 points under the new lines.)\n\nMichigan’s 3rd District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRepublican chances here got steeper for two reasons. One, the district became more Democratic in redistricting, and two, GOP Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted for Trump’s impeachment, lost his primary after Democrats meddled in the race. That strategy could backfire, though, if Republican nominee John Gibbs, an election denier, pulls off a win.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/north-carolina-senate-beasley-budd-midterms/index.html", "title": "North Carolina Senate race may offer early indicators for 2024 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTed Cruz and Dave Matthews headlined campaign rallies within a short drive of each other in Raleigh, North Carolina, last week.\n\nMatthews peppered his hour-long set at a get-out-the-vote concert for Democratic Senate nominee Cheri Beasley with aphorisms like, “Sometimes when I look at the way things are right now, it’s the difference between decent people and bananas.”\n\nA few hours earlier, Cruz had revved up a much smaller crowd for Republican hopeful Ted Budd, shouting that freedom and America were worth defending.\n\nThe tunes were different but the refrains from the Republican senator from Texas and the left-leaning rock star were the same: This year’s North Carolina Senate race could end up being critical to deciding the balance of power in Washington for the next two years.\n\nMore on key Senate races Herschel Walker defends use of ‘honorary’ sheriff’s badge in Georgia Senate debate Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch but face GOP advertising onslaught Democratic senator in competitive Colorado race defends party on inflation Five takeaways from the Georgia Senate debate See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nAnd it may offer early indicators for the 2024 presidential race. For Republicans, the contest in a state that delivered Donald Trump his smallest margin of victory in 2020 could reveal the extent to which Trumpism – which has moved beyond Trump himself – has taken hold in the state. For Democrats anxious about Florida and Ohio shifting red, and about other close states coming under control of officials who may stand in the way of certifying election wins, the result could be an early sign of whether North Carolina – and its now 16 electoral votes – helps give them a viable path through the Electoral College.\n\n“The eyes of the nation are watching us in North Carolina because we are a microcosm of the nation,” said Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield, who’s retiring after 18 years. “I certainly hope that voters have enough sense to not elect a long cadre of Republican candidates. If they do so, it’s going to empower and embolden Donald Trump and his allies and give them a false sense of being able to win in 2024.”\n\nOver the past 10 years, more North Carolinians have registered as “unaffiliated” than as Democrats and Republicans, and state voters have grown accustomed to elections decided by “razor thin” margins. But Democrats have spent the past few months side-eyeing Beasley, a former state Supreme Court chief justice, as their sleeper insurance policy for holding the evenly divided Senate.\n\nThey’re not the only ones.\n\n“We will not win the majority if Ted Budd does not win here in North Carolina, I promise you that,” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said last week while campaigning for Budd in a fairgrounds building in the small town of Salisbury.\n\nThis state, with its cross-section of geographies and populations, has functioned as a practical laboratory for national politics over the past 20 years, teasing Democrats with the possibility that they’re so close to winning statewide federal races but then reassuring Republicans nearly every time with the wins they rack up.\n\nBeasley and Budd and their campaigns keep urging supporters to find 10, or maybe even 12, friends and neighbors to vote, telling them it really could come down to that. A Marist poll last week showed the race tied among registered voters but with Budd having a slight edge among those who “definitely” plan to vote. And after months of quiet multimillion-dollar dumps from outside groups and super PACs, millions more are pouring in for the final week of outreach.\n\nBudd’s low-key Trumpism\n\nBudd speaks at rally in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on October 14, 2022. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nBudd was the first Senate nonincumbent to receive Trump’s endorsement this cycle, and he’s had a full Trump embrace since then, thanks to his own full embrace of the former President. But his connection is more centered on the hard-right politics that Trump tapped into than the former president’s brash style or rhetoric.\n\nWhile Budd hasn’t been keeping his distance from Trump’s orbit – Donald Trump Jr. stumped with him last month – he has been keeping a lower profile, limiting himself to one public event per day and rarely showing up on Fox News like many other Republican Senate nominees looking for national attention.\n\nA win for Budd would be a further turn to the right for North Carolina: He has a lifetime of 98% on the Heritage Action scorecard, which measures how conservative members of Congress are. (The hard-right group has put money into the race on his behalf.) In comparison, the state’s two Republican senators, retiring Sen. Richard Burr and Sen. Thom Tillis, hold scores of 61% and 64% respectively. Budd voted against certifying the 2020 election in the hours after the pro-Trump mob was cleared from the US Capitol last year. More recently, he was quick to embrace South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s proposal for a national ban on most abortions after 15 weeks, co-sponsoring the companion House version. He has also voted against raising the debt ceiling.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Budd keeps a sunny air while sticking to talking points.\n\n“When I look at inflation, when I look at crime, when I look at parents wanting a say in their kids’ education – everything that the Democrats have done and that Cheri Beasley would do makes life worse for the people of North Carolina, and everything I’m going to do will make life better,” Budd said in an interview after the campaign stop in Salisbury last week, outfitted in a navy puffer vest and dark gray sneakers.\n\nA few minutes earlier, Budd had the crowd nodding eagerly along as he accused President Joe Biden of telling the world “that the aggressors can be aggressors,” quoted Milton Friedman on inflation and promised to “put the brakes” on the president’s agenda.\n\nOn the air, Budd’s campaign and allies have aggressively gone after Beasley, accusing her of turning dangerous criminals loose while on the bench, including saying that she “struck down” a law to require GPS tracking for sex offenders. (Beasley and other judges call that charge “deceitful” since the ruling was to limit the scope of the law and not strike it down.)\n\nDemocrats like Butterfield, the retiring congressman, don’t even wait to be asked about the attacks to insist they’re unfair – but admit they’re having an impact.\n\nDemocrats between hope and heartbreak\n\nBeasley campaigns in Smithfield, North Carolina, on October 19, 2022. Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images\n\nBarack Obama’s 2008 win in North Carolina energized Democrats, and they’ve been chasing that high ever since.\n\nObama’s reelection strategists picked Charlotte for the Democratic convention in 2012, but by the time the president arrived to give his nomination acceptance speech, they knew the state wouldn’t be winnable that November.\n\nTwo years later, Democrat Kay Hagan, who had run ahead of Obama in 2008 while defeating Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole, was unseated in the 2014 red wave.\n\nHillary Clinton flew in for a raucous midnight rally with Jon Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga as the clock ticked over to Election Day in 2016 – and the state ended up being called relatively early for Trump.\n\nThe extramarital texts of Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham may have cost Democrats a seat they believed would be theirs in 2020, and probably sank Biden’s chances there too.\n\nThis has left some North Carolina Democrats feeling like they should start assuming a loss now to better manage any heartbreak this time and to accept that they haven’t been able to keep up with Republicans and Trump.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper – who ran ahead of both Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 while winning his two terms – passed on running for Senate himself this year, despite being courted once again by national Democrats. High on his list of reasons to say no: concern about what would happen if he won and was succeeded by the state’s hard-right Republican lieutenant governor, who is separately elected.\n\nThat left Beasley, who lost her bid for a full term as state Supreme Court chief justice in 2020 by 401 votes, as the rare prominent Democrat left in the state to run. She was also seen as well positioned to withstand the current political environment: She could stand on her record as a judge to rebut attacks that she was soft on crime and could also hold herself up as a Washington outsider without ties to Biden.\n\nIn her efforts to end Senate Democrats’ losing streak in North Carolina, Beasley has been chasing votes beyond the burgeoning party strongholds in Charlotte and the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill – including the hundreds of mostly middle-aged White voters she had cheering for her at the Dave Matthews concert. She’s been dipping into Trump counties, looking to find the disconnected Democrats that she hopes she can still get enthused again.\n\nAt an event last week at a senior center in Apex in the Raleigh area, Beasley talked mostly about lowering prices and cast Budd as being in the pocket of corporations for not voting to cut prescription drug and insulin prices. (Budd voted against Democrats’ sweeping health care, tax and climate package known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to lower drug prices and caps insulin costs for Medicare enrollees.)\n\nIn an interview after leading the people in the room across a path to an early voting site, Beasley, wearing a “Protect Roe” necklace against her purple dress, deflected a question about Budd and Cruz mocking her for not appearing with Biden. She deflected another question about what the tightness of the race reflected about the North Carolina she knew and the continued resonance of Trump.\n\nHer experience as a judge comes across in her measured manner and in the way she bristles at attacks by falling back on well-balanced, well-rehearsed lines.\n\nEarlier in the summer, Democrats nationally had been citing Beasley as a model for others, pointing out how early and aggressively she’d worked to define herself and firmly distance herself from calls to “defund the police” and other positions popular among the most progressive in her party.\n\nBeasley, in her interview, tacitly acknowledged her frustration with the attacks on her record on the bench that she believes have tried to sensationalize sometimes complex rulings. Budd, she said, was “far more interested in fear-mongering and scaring folks rather than actually providing solutions for folks here in North Carolina.”\n\n“Folks do have a clear choice, and they need to know – clearly – what that is,” she said.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-armageddon-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Biden's chilling 'Armageddon' warning sharpens the stakes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTo learn that an American president is talking so frankly about the possibility of nuclear “Armageddon,” as Joe Biden did Thursday, is bone chilling.\n\nIt’s also a commentary on the grave uncertainty over how Russian President Vladimir Putin, a self-styled strongman, might react to the increasing possibility of defeat in Ukraine in a war to which he has nailed his political survival.\n\nBiden’s remarks, at a fundraising event in New York, could open him to criticism by political opponents that he is speaking in an inartful way about nuclear war – and at a political fundraiser of all places. But they are paradoxically also a little reassuring because they reveal a president who is deeply conscious of the risks of escalation with the volatile Kremlin leader.\n\nAnd whether they were meant for public consumption or not, his comments will have the effect of signaling to Putin that any use of nuclear arms – even a smaller battlefield device – could create a cascade of consequences that could lead to global disaster. In other words, Biden may be reasserting a measure of deterrence after Putin warned that he was not bluffing over his threat to possibly use a nuclear bomb.\n\nBut Biden’s comments also show that, in one way at least, Putin’s nuclear threats have worked: They have left his adversaries unsure how he might behave.\n\nBiden told Democratic donors that the world had arrived at a dangerous moment.\n\n“(For the) first time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if, in fact, things continue down the path they are going,” Biden said.\n\n“We’ve got a guy I know fairly well,” Biden said of Putin.\n\n“He’s not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.”\n\nUS officials are concerned that Putin might consider the use of a smaller tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine in a desperate attempt to turn the course of the war. The White House says it has warned the Kremlin that such a decision would be “catastrophic” for Russia but has not said publicly exactly how they would respond – though there is speculation NATO might get involved and directly target Russian forces, a scenario that could lead to a dangerous escalation with Moscow.\n\nUS officials have also said, however, that they have detected no sign that Russia is moving or readying any of its tactical nuclear weapons, which can be small enough to target soldier formations or big enough to destroy a city. A US official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on Friday that Biden was speaking “frankly” following Putin’s “irresponsible and reckless” rhetoric but that his comments were not based on any new information about Russia’s nuclear posture. There has also been no shift in the US nuclear posture, the official said.\n\nEx-US defense secretary says in unlikely event that Putin resorts to nukes, he could use this weapon 02:08 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s burden\n\nBiden’s comments on Thursday underscore the burden that he now shoulders since the first president since the end of the Cold War more than 30 years ago who faces the frightening reality that nuclear war with Moscow is possible. At least once, during the decades-long standoff between the US and the Soviet Union, Armageddon could have been triggered accidentally, historical accounts show. But the only time that Washington and Moscow stood on the brink of a deliberate nuclear exchange was in the tense 13-day standoff almost exactly 60 years ago in October 1962 over Russian plans to station nuclear missiles in Cuba. Eventually, after intense messaging between Washington and Moscow, Russia leader Nikita Khrushchev backed down.\n\nPresidents are often less guarded during political fundraising events, which are usually not on camera even though a press pool is allowed in for some remarks. So it’s possible that the President’s comments – his most stark on the nuclear question since the war in Ukraine started – might not have happened in a more conventional setting like a news conference. And the White House has frequently walked back unscripted presidential remarks on foreign policy, especially on how the US would respond if China invaded Taiwan.\n\nBut Biden’s musings do appear to offer a window into his thinking as he games out how this crisis ends. He seems to have been wrestling over the very same questions about escalation and avoiding a moment of no return that President John Kennedy faced in 1962 in his game of nuclear poker.\n\n“I’m trying to figure out what is Putin’s off ramp,” Biden said. “Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself in a position that he does not not only lose face but significant power within Russia?” Biden said.\n\nThe President may have been thinking of Kennedy’s commencement address at American University in Washington in 1963 in which he reflected on the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis and the risks posed by weapons that could end the world.\n\n“Above all, while defending our own vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war,” Kennedy said.\n\n“To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy – or of a collective death-wish for the world.”\n\nBiden has been scrupulous in trying to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia over Ukraine even though Putin has styled the conflict as a showdown with the West. But the great strategic danger now is that Russian defeats are leading Putin into exactly that corner that Kennedy warned against, where the Russian President may face a choice between humiliation or the use of a nuclear weapon.\n\nNo off ramps\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that there is no prospect of a diplomatic process to end the war. Ukraine is in no mood to talk after suffering an unprovoked invasion that has caused human carnage, especially as it now appears to have Russian troops on the run. Putin cannot afford any outcome to the war that looks like anything other than total victory even though his control over the Russian media might allow him to spin a loss into a win.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the lack of diplomatic off ramps during a visit to Peru on Thursday.\n\n“The fact is that President Putin and Russia have shown absolutely no interest in any kind of meaningful diplomacy. And unless and until they do, it’s very hard to pursue it,” Blinken said.\n\n“We’ve said all along, President (Volodymyr) Zelensky has said all along, that this will ultimately be resolved through diplomacy. And if and when Russia shows that it has any seriousness of purpose, about engaging in such diplomacy, we’ll be ready, we’ll be there. But every sign in this moment, unfortunately, points in the opposite direction.”\n\nThe longer the war goes on, and the greater the success of Ukraine’s forces, the more concern there will be about Putin reaching for his nuclear arsenal to try to change the equation. While some strategists think that he is either bluffing or that there are no real strategic advantages to breaking the nuclear taboo – an act that would leave Russia even more ostracized in the world – there is real concern in Western governments about Putin’s state of mind. All of his previous tactical assumptions and decisions in Ukraine have backfired and don’t show the kind of strategic caution and clear thinking that is critical when the question becomes whether or not to use nuclear weapons.\n\nWith that in mind, Biden appeared to be making an argument, which Putin will now be sure to hear about, that the idea that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine could be contained and not lead to a wider conflagration is wrong.\n\nThe entire strategic logic between maintaining nuclear weapons for self-defense is that they are too terrible to be used, and any nation that did would be writing their own death warrant.\n\nThe President has now sent a clear signal to the Russian leader that crossing the nuclear threshold in any way could cause an escalation that would lead to a disastrous full-on nuclear war.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon,” Biden said at the fundraiser.\n\nHis comments underscore the most important mission of his presidency – shepherding the world through the most dangerous nuclear brinkmanship in 60 years.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/07/2022-midterm-election-live-updates-monday/8286753001/", "title": "Election 2022 live updates: Justice Department sending monitors to ...", "text": "Live updates Tuesday: Head here for the latest on 2022 midterm elections.\n\nWith one day before the Nov. 8 election, both Democratic and Republican leaders portrayed confidence and optimism heading into the home stretch.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stuck close to home on Monday, campaigning in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore.

Instead, he said, he’s “optimistic” about the House and Democrats “have a shot at keeping the Senate and increasing it.”\n\n“We're going to surprise the living devil out of people,” Biden said during a separate virtual gathering for state party leaders.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nBlack voters worry about cost of losing Senate control\n\nLAS VEGAS — Beverly Williams, 59, said that, as a Black woman, she worries what it might mean if incumbent Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto lost to Republican Adam Laxalt. She worries it could lead to the rollback of protections for minority Americans, less emphasis on alternative energy and climate change, and harsh policing.\n\nAcknowledging that inflation, gas prices and interest rates are top drivers for many voters, Williams said she’s focused on improving turnout in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Although tens of thousands have cast ballot during early voting which ended Friday.\n\n“There’s a still of lot of ballots that need to be cast,” said Williams, a union leader for the local Teamsters and central labor council.\n\n- Trevor Hughes\n\nBiden calls rally heckler 'crazy'\n\nThe location of President Joe Biden’s final rally before Tuesday’s midterm elections might have seemed like an odd choice.\n\nHe visited heavily Democratic Maryland where Wes Moore, the party’s gubernatorial candidate, is expected to win easily. But the backdrop gave Biden a chance to emphasize one of his closing arguments: democracy is on the ballot.\n\nBiden reminded voters that GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox organized busloads of protesters to Washington for the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“You can’t be pro-American and pro-insurrection,” Biden said. “It’s real simple.”\n\nThree hecklers tried to interrupt Biden during his 20-minute pitch to elect Moore and other Democrats.\n\n“You’re a disgrace,” the first heckler had yelled from an upper level at the back of the gymnasium at Bowie State University.\n\n“Hey man, don’t jump. You look crazy enough to jump,” Biden yelled back when interrupted by a second hollering man.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: GOP will erase progress for Black Americans\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned in a radio interview that Republicans will undo the progress that Black Americans have made under his administration if the GOP gains control of the House and the Senate.\n\n“Every single thing that I’ve proposed, with virtually one or two exceptions, the Republican Party has been against it,” Biden said during the talk-radio program \"Keepin’ It Real With Rev. Al Sharpton.\" The interview was taped Sunday and broadcast on Monday.\n\nBiden cited several initiatives his administration has pursued that he said have benefitted Black Americans, including student loan debt forgiveness, $5 billion in funding for historically Black colleges and universities, cutting the cost of prescription drugs and the appointment of the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTop Putin ally appears to admit Russian interference in U.S. elections\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy Russian businessman and top confidante of Vladimir Putin, allegedly claimed in a social media post Monday that the Kremlin intentionally has meddled in U.S. elections in an attempt to subvert American democracy.\n\nPrigozhin, commonly referred to as “Putin’s chef,” made his remarks on Telegram, suggesting that the Kremlin will continue to interfere in the U.S. democratic process.\n\nHis comments were reported by Reuters, CNN and other media outlets, and it was not immediately clear if Prigozhin was being serious or sarcastic. But his claims appear to be the first such admission by a senior Russian figure about Moscow’s interference in American elections – an allegation that Washington has been making for years.\n\nIn response to a journalist’s question about whether Russia is meddling in the midterm elections on Tuesday, Prigozhin said: “I will answer you very subtly, and delicately and I apologize, I will allow a certain ambiguity. Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere.”\n\nLike many other Russian oligarchs, Prigozhin is not a formal Kremlin official but retains close ties to its leadership through his various business dealings. Those include catering events for Putin and Prigozhin’s claimed ownership of a brutal paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group.\n\nThe U.S. government has sanctioned Prigozhin for funding a notorious Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency or IRA. In July, the State Department offered up to $10 million in reward money for credible information on anyone trying to interfere in U.S. elections, singling out Prigozhin in particular.\n\nAsked about Prigozhin’s comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they “do not tell us anything new or surprising.”\n\n“It’s well known and well documented in the public domain that entities associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin have sought to influence elections around the world, including the United States,” she said at a White House briefing. “The U.S. has worked to expose and counter Russia’s malign influence efforts as we discover them.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nPastor of Philly’s largest Black church worried about turnout\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Rev. Alyn Waller said he preaches like he has a Bible in one hand and a newspaper in the other.\n\nIn his Sunday sermon at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church – the largest Black church in Philadelphia with about 14,000 members – he talked about how the truth is on trial in America.\n\n“As Christians, we strive to be good citizens, and voting is part of that,” Waller said.\n\nBut he’s concerned the faithful may not heed his words.\n\nBlack voters don’t fit in with the far right or far left and have been left behind by both Republicans and Democrats to some degree, he said. Democrats didn’t understand that the Black voters in his church cared about public safety and didn’t want to defund the police, and Republicans push an economic message without fully understanding their kitchen-table issues, Waller said.\n\n“When you feel like neither party really cares about what’s going on in your life, you’re not as motivated to vote,” he said. “But it’s important to be heard because American democracy is on the line.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nYoungkin, McCarthy in Virginia tonight for a Get Out the Vote rally\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin will join Republican nominee Jen Kiggans in Virginia Beach for a rally on the evening before Election Day.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich will also be on stage, along with Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears and Attorney General Jason Miyares.\n\nKiggans faces Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, who served on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. Luria has consistently outraised her opponent this election cycle, though their remains competitive with Luria having just a slight edge, according to Cook Political Report.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nGeorgia Democrat calls the polls a 'lie'\n\nSpeaking at a rally for Sen. Raphael Warnock rally on Monday, Georgia state Rep. James Beverly, the House Democratic leader, told the audience not to believe the polls showing his party behind.\n\n“I don’t care what the polls say because they do one thing and one thing only – they lie,” he said.\n\nMultiple polls have shown the race between Warnock and Republican opponent Herschel Walker to be a dead heat with the former NFL star holding a slight edge.\n\nBut Democrats and their allies in the Peach State point to record-breaking early voting as a sign that their optimism that they can resist a supposed GOP wave isn’t unfounded.\n\nThe secretary of state’s office reports Georgia voters exceeded expectations, and have shattered the 2.5 million mark for ballots cast prior to Election Day. That far exceeds the 1.8 million early voting ballots cast in 2018.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSisters carrying on mom’s legacy\n\nPHILADELPHIA — When Danese Saunders and Deborah Garrett carry campaign signs and clipboards, they feel like they’re carrying on their mother’s legacy.\n\nFlorence Garrett was a Philadelphia city council candidate and community organizer who helped to elect numerous Democrats through the years. She died a day after Election Day in 2011, and since then her daughters have carried on her mantle of working phones and front porches to turn out the vote in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Monday, they were volunteering in Northwest Philadelphia to rally voters ahead of Election Day.\n\n“She’s not here anymore, but her work lives on,” said Debra Garrett, 72, of Cheltenham Township in Montgomery County.\n\nSaunders, 70, of the Mount Airy neighborhood in Philadelphia, was confident their work would produce good results on Tuesday.\n\nBased on the enthusiasm they’re seeing, Saunders and Garrett are skeptical of a “red wave,” but acknowledge turnout will need to be high for Democrats to win. Their prediction? “Women are going to be a difference-maker in this election,” Saunders said.\n\nAnd that would make their mom proud, they said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nHere's why security officials are concerned about claims of a hacked (or stolen) election\n\nDespite an unprecedented U.S. focus on preventing hackers from targeting the midterm elections Tuesday, there are still concerns that malicious cyber operatives could disrupt or influence the vote by penetrating polling stations, voter registration rolls, ballot-counting efforts and even the news reports that tell Americans who’s winning state, local and federal elections.\n\nPublic and private sector security analysts say they’re especially concerned about malicious cyber actors making false claims that the election was rigged, hacked or stolen even when nothing of the sort occurred.\n\nSuch false claims, building on years of bogus election fraud narratives that began well before the 2020 presidential election, they say, could plunge the country into an unprecedented environment of political chaos and violence worse than that which spawned the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nSuffolk poll: In NH, Hassan has edge. In Arizona, Senate is anyone’s race\n\nA new bellwether poll from Suffolk University showed a slight edge for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire and also revealed that Arizona’s Senate seat is anyone’s game, with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters almost tied.\n\nBellwether polls are polls conducted in specific communities to predict a winner – the communities tend to reflect the state’s overall vote. In the town of Barrington, New Hampshire, Hassan leads Republican Don Bolduc by 4 percentage points, at 49%-45%.\n\n“As far as Barrington goes, it has been spot-on in New Hampshire midterms mirroring the statewide vote,” said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in a statement.\n\nIn Maricopa County, Arizona, Kelly leads with only 1 percentage point, nearly tied with Masters at 48%-47%.\n\nBoth polls were conducted Nov. 3-6 and have a margin of error of +/- 5.7%.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nNevada unions plan final push for Democratic votes\n\nLAS VEGAS — In Nevada, Las Vegas-area union workers are preparing a massive final push to get people to the polls, having already knocked on 930,000 doors by Monday morning, the UNITE HERE Culinary Union said.\n\nThe union, which represents thousands of Strip and casino workers, has focused its attention on turning out Black, Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander voters, in part to help protect incumbent U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto from a tough Republican challenger who could flip control of the Senate.\n\nAfter attending a union rally for Democrats on Sunday just outside Las Vegas, Maria Guadalupe Arreola, 58, said she was more dedicated than ever to her volunteer efforts to contact potential Democratic voters.\n\nArreola, who works as a cook, said she’s been making the case that keeping Democrats in charge will help protect immigrants and public education. She said many are unhappy about inflation and high gas prices, and she’s been urging them to look beyond their immediate needs.\n\n“I’m really worried but I try to explain to them that we have to vote because if we don’t, things will get more difficult,” Arreola told USA TODAY.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nSuffolk Poll on Nevada race:Place your bets: Pivotal Nevada Senate race a virtual tie amid economic alarm\n\nDOJ deploying election monitors to 64 locations, key battleground states\n\nThe Justice Department is deploying election monitors to 64 jurisdictions across the country, including locations in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nFederal monitors, drawn from the ranks of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and local U.S. attorneys’ offices, are regularly dispatched during election cycles in a attempt to ensure compliance with voter access provisions and guard against illegal interference and intimidation.\n\nJustice’s Civil Rights Division will also field complaints from the public related to possible violations of the federal voting rights laws through its call center at 800-253-3931 or on the department’s website.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division enforces federal voting rights laws, while Justice’s Criminal Division enforces federal laws prohibiting voter intimidation and voter suppression based on race, color, national origin or religion.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nCyber fears?:Here's why security officials are concerned about claims of a hacked (or stolen) election\n\nOver 1,000 mail-in ballots in Pittsburgh area might not be counted\n\nIn Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, over one thousand mail-in ballots have been reported as either incorrectly dated or not dated at all. The county is home to Pittsburgh, key to a victory for Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued an order last Saturday that told boards of elections not to count ballots that are undated or incorrectly dated. The order, issued days before the election, meant there was “not opportunity to notify impacted voters by letter of this decision and their opportunity to cure,” said Allegheny County’s office of elections in a statement.\n\nInstead, the office released a list of over a thousand names, asking voters to check to see if their name is listed and if so, to cure their ballot.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n‘We have handcuffs for you’: Philly officials highlight election security\n\nOfficials in Philadelphia, an early front in former President Donald Trump’s effort to sow doubt in 2020 vote, issued pointed warnings Monday to those who may be contemplating new attempts at interference or intimidation:\n\n“We have handcuffs for you; we have jail cells for you,” District Attorney Larry Krasner said an election security briefing.\n\nIn 2020, local election administrators became targets of a torrent of threats after Trump falsely referred to Philadelphia as a hotbed of election fraud, suggesting in a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden that “bad things happen in Philadelphia.”\n\nTrump’s allegations unleashed a campaign of intimidation that continued for days after the election as authorities worked to certify the local vote.\n\nOn the eve of the midterms, officials said there would be little tolerance for such activity during this cycle.\n\n“I’ll be damned in democracy dies on my watch,” said Omar Sabir, a Philadelphia election commissioner.\n\nThe district attorney and Mayor Jim Kenney also appealed for patience, signaling that a final vote may take days to complete.\n\n“Nobody will be permitted to unlawfully interfere with this election,” Kenney said.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nFetterman’s closing argument in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA - This city, and especially the Black voters who live here, could determine if Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman leaves the state capital for the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring a final plea to voters on Monday morning, Fetterman asked them to show up at the polls on Tuesday.\n\nIn 2016, more than 216,000 registered Black voters stayed home, and Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 44,000 votes in Pennsylvania.\n\nFetterman reminded campaign volunteers that every vote counts during his closing argument in the state’s largest city and population center Monday morning.\n\n“I won my very first election by one single vote,” he said to supporters who gathered at a canvassing event on Limekiln Pike. Fetterman was referring to his first term as Braddock mayor, when in 2005 he won the seat by one vote.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nCommon Cause: Election Day is not results day\n\nElection watchdogs and campaigns are warning the results of voting that end Tuesday might not be known for days because of how closely matched the candidates are in polls in states such as Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Keystone State is one of 38 states that prohibit counting mail-in votes before the polls open Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m., but the counting could take longer because election officials must process ballots such as checking to make sure the voter signs and dates the declaration outside the envelope.\n\n“It takes time to count every vote accurately and that’s why Election Day is not results day,” Khalif Ali, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, said in a statement. \"Even if we don’t know the election winners when we go to bed, what matters most is making sure every voter’s ballot is counted accurately.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTom Cotton makes it official: He won't run for president in 2024\n\nAs the 2002 midterm elections ends, the 2024 presidential race begins – but Tom Cotton won't be a part of it.\n\nThe Arkansas senator, who traveled during the midterms to assess his chances for a presidential run, told Fox News that family considerations prevent him from taking the plunge.\n\n\"This is not the right time for our family for me to commit to a six-to-seven day a week campaign for the next two years,\" Cotton told Fox News.\n\nCotton, who is only 45, did not rule out a future presidential bid: \"This is a decision only about this 2024 race and this time for my family. We’ll make a decision about future races in the future.\"\n\nExpect a few of these kinds of announcements in the weeks ahead.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nIf GOP wins big:What would a Republican Congress look like? A lot of investigations and maybe impeachment.\n\nMcCarthy shares Republicans' plans on immigration, inflation\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is poised to become House speaker if Republicans win control of the House this week, discussed in an interview with CNN on Sunday Republicans’ plans to secure the border and reduce inflation if in control of the House.\n\nOn immigration, McCarthy said Republicans will first introduce a bill to control the border and then focus on stopping drug cartels, preventing fentanyl from crossing the border and providing more resources to border agents.\n\nThe minority leader then blamed inflation partially on the passage of the American Rescue Plan. He said to make the economy stronger there is a need to curtail government spending, incentivize Americans to work and ensure the country is energy independent.\n\nMcCarthy said after the election, he will introduce provisions to ensure the House is financially in order.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nBiden stumps in New York\n\nWith enthusiasm brimming for New York Republicans, President Joe Biden came to Yonkers on Sunday evening to stump for Gov. Kathy Hochul and the New York Democratic ticket just 36 hours before polls open on Nov. 8.\n\nIt comes at a time of particular peril for New York's ruling Democrats, who control all statewide offices, have majorities in the state Assembly and Senate, and hold 21 of 29 New York seats in Congress. They find themselves on the defensive, with Republicans making inroads in a state where Democrats outnumber them 2-to-1 in party enrollments.\n\nHe called on the students to vote, to maintain American democracy.\n\n\"You are the best educated, you are the least prejudiced, you are the most involved generation,\" he said. \"If you show up to vote, democracy is sustained.\"\n\n– David McKay Wilson and Erin Nolan, Rockland/Westchester Journal News\n\nGubernatorial races:Abortion, voting and COVID-19: Why we're eyeing these 10 governor's races in 2022 midterms\n\nTrump gives DeSantis a nickname:Clinton, Sanders rally voters ahead midterm elections; GOP 'will accept' results: Sunday recap\n\nTrump rallies for Rubio in Miami\n\nFormer President Trump lavished praise on Sen. Marco Rubio again and again Sunday at a rally in Miami, saying he’s “tough” and “smart” and “a true conservative warrior who gets the job done.”\n\nTrump slammed his opponent, Rep. Val Demings as a \"radical Democrat.\"\n\nRubio told Trump and the crowd how important the election was to Miami, hammering home what he’s said in campaign ads and in campaign speeches: That Democrats and Demings, if elected, would bring socialism to South Florida and the nation.\n\n“This is a community of people who lost their (home) country — they saw the destruction of countries, the nation of their birth,” he said. “They saw what socialism and communism and Marxism can do, and they are not going to lose this country.”\n\n“Like so many Americans, they love America, but when you know what life is like somewhere else, you will fight to save it,” he said.\n\nTrump followed up, saying, “I wish I would have said that. That was very good. He’s a great guy.”\n\n– USA TODAY Network-Florida\n\nRubio says he'll win big in Florida\n\nSen. Marco Rubio predicted Sunday he was going to win the U.S. Senate race against Democrat Val Demings with a strong GOP voter turnout, cautioning Republican voters to not pay attention to the latest polls showing him and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis with huge leads against their opponents.\n\n“The only thing only thing at this point that I believe can save Democrats here in Florida up and down the ballot is if Republicans decide to stay home because they see polling numbers and think it's no longer competitive,” Rubio told Fox News host Trey Gowdy on his “Sunday night in America” show. “Then we would make it competitive by not showing up.”\n\n– Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nClinton stumps in Vegas for Cortez Masto\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of union workers a few miles east of the Las Vegas strip, former President Bill Clinton ticked off the issues he said are top of mind for many voters: inflation, unemployment and gas prices.\n\nBut he said fear of short-term pain shouldn’t drive elections, criticizing Republican candidates and voters he called “right now” people unwilling to look beyond their own immediate desires.\n\n“This is not rocket science.

Broadcast executives and anchors generated a lot of news of their own in 2016 -- some of which they’d surely prefer to keep off the air.\n\nThe presidential campaign also revealed the crucial and constantly evolving role the media plays in not only reporting but also making news on its own. Social media channels, like Twitter, also emerged as a forceful player in national politics. Here's a look at the biggest names in media from the last 12 months:\n\nGretchen Carlson. The former Fox broadcaster singlehandedly ended the turbulent but profitable reign of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in July, and the network’s parent, 21st Century Fox,, apologized and agreed to pay her $20 million to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit. Carlson, a former beauty contestant and a Stanford University graduate, filed the lawsuit, alleging that Ailes sexually harassed her and created a work environment that tolerated rampant sexual harassment. After her lawsuit, other women stepped forward to accuse Ailes of harassment, forcing Fox to fire Ailes albeit with a hefty severance package. Carlson said she was \"gratified” by Fox’s response and said she will “redouble (her) efforts to empower women in the workplace.\"\n\nMegyn Kelly. Long a rising star at Fox News, she cemented her place as an influential political broadcaster in 2016 with her well-reviewed performance as a debate moderator and by standing her ground against Donald Trump, who fired back at her with what many thought to be sexist remarks. Kelly also became one of the voices supporting Carlson and detailed sexual harassment she allegedly endured from Ailes in her recent book, Settle for More. Through it all, she remains a ratings star at the network and could be in line for a hefty pay raise – at Fox or another network.\n\nSumner Redstone to exit Viacom board in move seen as symbolic\n\nRoger Ailes. In July, the Fox News CEO left the media enterprise he helped build under the direction of billionaire mogul Rupert Murdoch in the wake of sexual harassment claims. First came those from former Fox News host Carlson, then more accusers emerged including Kelly. The story may not fade anytime soon, as there's word a Hollywood film about Ailes and Kelly may be in the works.\n\nShari Redstone. With the help of her lawyers, the daughter of billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone seized control of Viacom this year by forcing out embattled CEO Philippe Dauman, whom she distrusted and considered ineffective, and remaking its board with new members. While her father is nominally the CEO of the family company that controls Viacom and CBS, National Amusements, Sumner Redstone is 93 and in frail health. And it’s widely believed that Shari Redstone is firmly in charge and will be an influential voice in the direction of the two companies. She remains on the board of Viacom after her father announced earlier this month that he will resign his place after the company's annual meeting in February. Sumner Redstone continues to be on the CBS board.\n\nPhilippe Dauman. The former chairman and CEO of Viacom was forced to leavein August after six years atop the media company after a power struggle with Redstone, president of National Amusements, which owns 80% of Viacom’s controlling stock. Dauman, who’s known her father, Sumner Redstone, for decades, had portrayed Shari Redstone as an estranged daughter returning only to seize control of Viacom. But in settling with the Redstones’ lawyers, Dauman conceded to the realities of corporate ownership and the family’s waning trust in his ability to lead the media company amid turbulent changes in the industry. His 2016 takeaway? $93 million.\n\n\n\nRandall Stephenson. The AT&T Chairman and CEO aims build a vertical integrated communications and content giant with its bid $85.4 billion bid to acquire Time Warner, home of HBO, CNN and TNT. During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump said he would block the merger, but a more congenial President-elect has increased optimism for its approval. Also last month, AT&T launched its cord cutter-targeting DirecTV Now television service delivered over the Internet this year -- a spinoff of the satellite TV provider DirecTV it acquired in 2014. \"Our intent is to disrupt the existing pay-TV model,\" Stephenson told a Senate subcommittee looking into the AT&T-Time Warner deal earlier this month.\n\nJack Dorsey. Twitter, which Dorsey helped co-found, got plenty of traction during the election cycle and a lot of attention from Trump's near-constant tweeting habit. Election Day's 75 million-plus election-related tweets was a new record for Twitter. The incoming president's use of the outlet \"as a direct line of communication allows everyone to see what’s on his mind, in the moment. I think that’s interesting,\" Dorsey has said. Stocks of other companies have risen and fallen based on Trump's tweets, too. What would be more interesting to Twitter shareholders would be for Dorsey to find a way to help the struggling social network profit from the president-elect's usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Denton. The controversial journalist-turned-media entrepreneur declared bankruptcy in Augustafter his company, Gawker Media, was sued by retired pro wrestler Hulk Hogan for publishing a sex tape of him. Hogan, financially backed by Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, pressed on with the expensive lawsuit and won a $115 million judgment, resulting in Gawker.com’s demise. Univision bought Gawker’s other assets out of bankruptcy for $135 million. Denton said he was getting out of the “news and gossip business” and may pursue other projects to make the Internet “a forum for the open exchange of ideas and information.”\n\nJeff Zucker. The CNN president, who brought Donald Trump's The Apprentice reality show to TV in 2004 while he served as NBC Universal CEO, found himself defending the cable news network's coverage of Trump's campaign. Many critics, including other Republican hopefuls, said CNN's airing of full-length Trump rallies helped win the nomination. Zucker said, could he do it all over again, he might air less unedited footage from Trump events. In a new book, Unprecedented: The Election That Changed Everything, Zucker said CNN realized before other media outlets \"that Trump had much broader appeal.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg. Another target of post-election criticism, Facebook came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news stories that were shared over the social network. An analysis by Buzzfeed found that fake stories outperformed real news stories during the final three months of the campaign cycle.

MSNBC went the opposite direction politically, as would be expected, but it did follow a similar direction conceptually, hiring former Biden insider Symone D. Sanders to host talk shows on cable and streaming.\n\nCNN did something different entirely: It poached Audie Cornish, an acclaimed journalist and interviewer who spent the past 16 years at NPR.\n\nCornish will lead a weekly series on CNN+, the streaming service that will launch this spring. “She will also host a new podcast for CNN Audio and will appear on CNN covering national, political and breaking news,” the network said.\n\nThe key word in that sentence might be “news.” Of the three big appointments across three cable brands on Monday, Cornish was the only journalist.\n\nCNN certainly has many political commentators on the payroll – Sanders used to be one of them – but the recent spate of hires for CNN+ have been capital-J journalists like Chris Wallace and apolitical personalities like food writer and chef Alison Roman.\n\nCNN executives have signaled that the streaming service will feature a wide array of programming, including travel and lifestyle shows.\n\n“We have a great product on CNN that serves our audience. What you will see from CNN+ will be distinctive and different,” chief digital officer Andrew Morse told Variety last month.\n\nMSNBC has also emphasized expansions into streaming video. Sanders’ deal is emblematic of MSNBC owner Comcast’s approach to the market. She will host a show on the weekends on MSNBC, for cable subscribers, and she’ll also have a show on The Choice, an arm of the Peacock streaming service, for those subscribers.\n\nOther MSNBC personalities, including Ayman Mohyeldin and Mehdi Hasan, have similar cross-platform gigs.\n\nFor the most part, these MSNBC programs present liberal points of view and prioritize guests over reporters in the field. The programs are more tethered to the news, however, than the equivalent hours on Fox, which function as outrageous opposition to the traditional news media.\n\nFox’s anti-media bent extends to its streaming venture, Fox Nation, which features a mix of middle-America lifestyle programming and far-right talk from the likes of Tucker Carlson. The platform launched in late 2018 and Fox Corporation has yet to share specific subscriber figures.\n\nWatters, who climbed the ladder at Fox by being Bill O’Reilly’s ambush interviewer and Donald Trump’s fan club leader, is a conservative commentator and sometimes comedian. The time slot he is taking over, 7 p.m., used to hew much closer to a newscast format, albeit slanted to the right. But it is now a right-wing talk show through and through, stuffed with political operative guests who advance GOP goals and ridicule the left.\n\nThe main credentials Fox listed in Monday’s press release about Watters were the high TV ratings for his shows. (He will continue to co-host “The Five” and will end his Saturday show “Watters’ World.”)\n\nMSNBC, in the press release announcing Sanders, highlighted her political credentials, noting her work on multiple Democratic presidential campaigns and her role last year as senior adviser and chief spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris. Sanders departed the VP’s office last month.\n\nAnd CNN, in the announcement about Cornish, touted her journalistic achievements, like her coverage of Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath and Barack Obama’s election.\n\nThree very different frames, showing three very different priorities for networks that are too often lumped together.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/media/fox-newsmax-january-6-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Here's how Fox and Newsmax tried to spin the January 6 ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThis column is about the media, and this moment exemplifies America’s two parallel tracks of media. So if you watched Thursday night’s hearing by the House’s 1/6 committee, shown live by most of the major TV networks in the United States, let me tell you what I watched on right-wing TV at the same time.\n\nThe prime-time hearing began at 8 p.m. Eastern time. When Rep. Bennie Thompson gaveled the hearing to order, Fox News host Tucker Carlson ignored him. Carlson declared that the “ruling class” was giving “yet another lecture about January 6.” He called the hearing “propaganda” and reveled in his refusal to air it. “They are lying,” he said, “and we are not going to help them do it.”\n\nCarlson then lied himself: He said “if something noteworthy happens” at the hearing, “obviously we will bring it to you immediately.” But his show did not do that.\n\nWhen Thompson said January 6 was “the culmination of an attempted coup,” Carlson asked why the news media cared at all. He barely mentioned Donald Trump, even though the former president’s plot to undermine American democracy was the focal point of the hearing. Instead, he talked a lot about Democrats and questioned why other networks were committing “collusion” with the House by televising the hearing. “Because the Democrats and the left are desperate,” his guest Jason Whitlock said.\n\nWhen Rep. Liz Cheney revealed many of the committee’s findings for the first time, Carlson said everyone knows that America “could face some real problems real soon;” implied that Congress shouldn’t be wasting its time on the 1/6 investigation; and called Thompson and Cheney “lunatics.”\n\nCarlson sounded like an amateur magician who tries to distract kids when a performance falls apart: “Look over here, not over there.” He said, “Gas is over five bucks. Inflation is higher than it’s been in the lifetime of most Americans. Violent crime is making cities impossible to live in, and more than one hundred thousand Americans ODed on drugs last year. Why isn’t there a prime time hearing about any of that?”\n\nFox ignored its own role\n\nAll evening long, Fox downplayed the violence of January 6 and dismissed the revelations about Trump’s conduct. The network also ignored its own role in promoting false claims about the election before the riot and the committee’s publication of private messages between some of its hosts.\n\nWhen Cheney read a text exchange between Fox stars Sean Hannity and Kayleigh McEnany from the day after the riot, with Hannity urging “no more crazy people” and “no more stolen election talk,” Carlson showed the live coverage on other networks and made fun of those networks. He did not mention anything about the texts.\n\nNewsmax, Fox’s right-wing rival, actually showed most of Cheney’s remarks, but cut away for analysis from pro-Trump commentators. The network’s banners also promoted Trump’s talking points and, at times, Newsmax’s own app.\n\nBack on Fox, when the committee showed a never-before-seen video of the Capitol being attacked, with terrifying images from surveillance cameras and other sources, Carlson’s producers showed sterile live shots of the hearing room, but not the video. One of his banners said “TODAY’S HEARING IS POLITICAL THEATER.”\n\nWhen the video concluded, Newsmax’s Rob Schmitt said, “we saw a lot worse in the summer of 2020, spurred on by comments from the other side of the aisle, that burned major cities in this country down. Where’s the hearing on that? Well they don’t have that hearing, because they don’t care about your life, where you live.”\n\nWhen Sean Hannity began his Fox program at 9 p.m., he did the same thing Carlson did: He showed silent live video of the hearing and talked over it the entire time. Hannity said the hearing – still in progress – was “the dullest, the most boring” Democratic “fund-raiser.” He didn’t play a word of what Cheney said. He focused instead on security lapses and laid the blame directly at House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s feet.\n\nWhen the committee swore in its witnesses, Fox’s banners called the hearing a “SHAM” and an “ANTI-TRUMP SHOW TRIAL.”\n\nWhen injured police officer Caroline Edwards described how she was tear gassed outside the Capitol, The Federalist editor in chief MZ Hemingway tweeted, “Is the Soviet-style show trial still going on?”\n\nWhen Edwards described “carnage” and said she was “slipping in peoples’ blood” outside the Capitol, Hannity said the hearing was a failure: “They overpromised, they underdelivered.” Somehow he claimed to know that already, even though he was on live TV during part two of the hearing. And no, he never acknowledged his own texts or his own role as an adviser to Trump.\n\nWhen the hearing concluded, and analysts on the other networks absorbed the enormity of what was presented, the pro-Trump media narrative was already baked. On Newsmax, Schmitt dismissed it as a “completely one-sided hearing about something that happened a year and a half ago.” On Fox, the banner on Laura Ingraham’s 10pm show said “JAN 6TH COMMITTEE FLOPS IN PRIMETIME.”\n\n“Don’t get me wrong…”\n\nWhy does the right-wing media opposition matter? Because it ensures that the country stays on two wildly different tracks of information.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong: These hearings are crucial and every American should be watching them,” The Atlantic contributing writer Tom Nichols wrote Thursday. “But the alternate reality that about forty percent of us live in will never be breached by actual facts.” The Dispatch senior editor David French estimated that “tens of millions” of people still don’t understand “the reality of January 6 in large part because the news outlets and personalities they trust are deliberately lying and/or withholding the plain truth about Trump and that dreadful day.”\n\nOf course, Fox News said days in advance that it would not show the prime time hearing on its flagship network, but it was still extraordinary to see the network follow through on its ignore-the-news plan. Mediaite’s editor in chief Aidan McLaughlin did not hold back: “The footage of horrific violence being aired right now is why this hearing isn’t airing on Fox News. So they can lie about it,” he tweeted.\n\nFox’s actual hearing coverage was relegated to the Fox Business Network, which has a tiny fraction of the main channel’s viewership. The coverage also streamed on Fox Nation and was available to Fox broadcast stations. Notably, however, Carlson and Hannity’s shows did not point to those outlets or promote those options. They did not put a box in the corner of the screen pushing to the news. Instead, Bret Baier tweeted a reminder that he was on Fox Business, and critical replies piled up.\n\nMade for TV?\n\n“We all heard that this was going to be a made-for-TV hearing, a presentation designed to capture the attention of the public in a way that normal Capitol Hill events simply do not,” Oliver Darcy wrote. “Specifically, we heard that the 1/6 committee was consulting with former ABC News president James Goldston to help with the production. The New York Times teased that Goldston had been hired ‘to produce the hearings as if they were a docudrama or a must-watch mini-series.’”\n\n“But in reality, the hearing did not feel like a ‘docudrama’ or ‘must-watch mini-series.’ Not even close,” Darcy wrote. “Instead, it mostly employed the style of a standard, run-of-the mill Capitol Hill hearing. Yes, there was also a haunting video package showing the raw violence of that day. But that video, the only real detour from the typical hearing format, only comprised a sliver of the two-hour affair.”\n\nThe hearing “was not the shock and awe it needed to be,” Deadline senior editor Dominic Patten wrote right afterward. “Despite the praise from TV talking heads, this was NPR when it should have been UFC.”\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck disagreed: “It remains to be seen whether what’s to follow in the coming weeks will do anything to move the needle among a citizenry that seems to have settled into their respective stances. But judging from the opening installment, there will be plenty of powerful material for those with open minds to digest.”\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

While MSNBC decided not to take the speech live, Fox News and CNN both aired large portions of Trump’s fairly low-energy and misinformation-peppered announcement. Newsmax aired it in full.\n\nCNN cut away from the Palm Beach spectacle after about 25 minutes, turning to a panel of analysts as well as network fact-checker Daniel Dale, who knocked down his “wildly incorrect” statements. Alyssa Farah Griffin, Trump’s former communications director-turned-CNN-analyst, pointed out that the speech included “outright lies” and that Trump was “dabbling into conspiracy” theories that she hasn’t “even seen on the dark corners of the internet.”\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nIt was a very different scene on Fox News where Trump propagandist Sean Hannity cut away from the speech after roughly 40 minutes. Hannity, whose show hyped Trump’s announcement throughout the event in the chyron, turned to pro-Trump commentators Pete Hegseth and Mike Huckabee for analysis. “Nothing like the original,” Hegseth said, surprising no one with commentary that praised Trump.\n\nFox News ultimately returned to carry much of what was left of Trump’s speech, perhaps indicating that while some arms of Rupert Murdoch’s media machine might be battering Trump, his most powerful mouthpiece is still reluctant to forcefully do so.\n\nIt’s also worth noting how print and digital outlets covered the speech. Here are some ledes and highlights from around the web:\n\n► The WaPo: “Donald Trump, the twice-impeached former president who refused to concede defeat and inspired a failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election culminating in a deadly attack on the Capitol, officially declared on Tuesday night that he is running to retake the White House in 2024.”\n\n► The NYT: “Donald J. Trump, whose historically divisive presidency shook the pillars of the country’s democratic institutions, on Tuesday night declared his intention to seek the White House again in 2024, ignoring the appeals of Republicans who warn that his continued influence on the party is largely to blame for its weaker-than-expected showing in the midterm elections.”\n\n► NewsMax: “Former President Donald Trump, eschewing establishment calls to hold off and endless Democrat efforts to stop him, officially declared his 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday night.”\n\n► The National Review editorial board published a piece simply titled, “No.”\n\nOf course, as the Drudge Report noted on its front page Tuesday night, there are still 721 days until the election. Which is to say, a lot can change. But the manner in which news organizations approached the speech is likely a good general barometer for what audiences can expect moving forward.\n\nThere is also the question of how Trump will treat the press. During his speech on Tuesday night, he struck a lighter tone, needling the media though refraining from doing it in the harsh terms that defined his relationship with news organizations at the end of his stay in the White House. Instead, Trump joked he would not “use the term ‘fake news media’” because he wanted to keep the event “elegant.”\n\nWe’ll see how long that lasts.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/media/fox-news-coverage-fbi-mar-a-lago-search/index.html", "title": "Fox News' coverage of the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago proves the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIf nothing else can be said with certainty about Donald Trump after a week of coverage filled with speculation about the purpose of the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago, it is that he still has the biggest cable TV news channel, Fox News, solidly behind him. He also has the editorial boards of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, two other major platforms owned by Rupert Murdoch, on his side so far.\n\nOne reason that matters is that both newspapers carried editorials highly critical of Trump in the wake of the last hearing by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. Furthermore, CNN and others like the Washington Post reported on and analyzed what appeared to be widening cracks in the relationship between the former president and the Murdochs. Whatever the nature of that relationship might be behind closed doors, the opinion hosts and writers of Murdoch’s properties were firmly in Trump’s corner in the wake of the Monday search, particularly Fox. There was neither hesitation nor mixed messaging. Fox hosts were all in with Trump against what the former president characterized as “weaponizing” of the Justice Department against him.\n\n“I’ve never seen the base more energized. I’ve never seen the base more angry. I’m angry,” Fox News prime-time host Jesse Watters said Tuesday. “I feel violated. The whole country feels violated. This is disgusting. They’ve declared war on us, and now it’s game on.”\n\nWith its audience of as many as 3 million viewers a weeknight for some of its prime-time programs, Fox also essentially handed the platform over to voices from MAGA world to stoke the anger against the FBI, Justice Department and White House.\n\nAmong the most egregious abdications of editorial control involved Fox giving the former president’s son, Eric, a forum to say without any pushback or evidence, “I know the White House as well as anyone, I spent a lot of time there, I know the system, this did not happen without Joe Biden’s explicit approval.” (A White House spokeswoman denied that President Biden had knowledge of the search ahead of time.)\n\n“Mar-a-Lago search shows the swamp’s Trump obsession,” a Wall Street Journal opinion column said. The sub-head read: “An FBI raid against a former president should never happen.”\n\nThe New York Post featured an opinion column headlined: “FBI Trump raid exposes Washington’s secrecy shams.” The lead paragraph quoted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a staunch Trump supporter, saying the search showed the Justice Department’s “intolerable state of weaponized politization.”\n\nThen on Thursday, the editorial boards of both Murdoch outlets published opinion pieces that took aim at Merrick Garland for his lack of transparency about the search.\n\nThe rest of the right-wing media was right there in lockstep.\n\nEric Trump was on Newsmax with the same talking points, telling host Greg Kelly he was “pissed off,” because “what this administration did is just unthinkable.”\n\nAs inflammatory as some might consider Watters’ talk of “war” and Eric Trump’s declaration of anger, they were mild compared to what was being said in digital space with frequent calls to “lock and load,” as charted by CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan.\n\nThere were widespread calls for armed warfare on behalf of Trump across social media. One NBC News report said, “in the minutes after news of the search broke, users on pro-Trump forums like TheDonald, a Reddit-like website that was used to provide logistics before the Capitol riot, urged immediate violence, asking questions like ‘When does the shooting start?’ and calling upon Trump to summon militias.”\n\nThis is another layer of media support for Trump that flexed its muscles this week on behalf of him, and it certainly seemed far more visible and threatening than it did during his campaign in 2016 – if it even existed then.\n\nTrump megaphone is even bigger\n\nCoverage of the search at Mar-a-Lago has been dismal on several levels, as this critique from Columbia Journalism Review outlined. There have been few if any winning press performances in the mainstream media. Meanwhile, the unified, militant right-wing media response to the search suggests Trump has an even larger and more dangerous megaphone than when he first ran for president.\n\nIn 2016, much of his political power came from his ability to successfully use both old (Fox News) and new (Twitter and Facebook) media to amplify his messaging. His media performance skillfully straddled that period of technological transition in which we still reside.\n\nTrump has since been banned on Facebook and Twitter, and his social media site, Truth Social, is struggling. But it didn’t seem to matter this week because mainstream media and tens of thousands of people on Twitter and elsewhere were retweeting, quoting, posting and citing what he was saying on Truth Social and elsewhere. He has dominated social media just as he did cable news this week.\n\nAnd Trump has further enhanced his echo chamber by adding yet another level of media messaging that he didn’t have in 2016: the MAGA members of Congress and candidates on the mid-term campaign trails whom he has backed. Many of them jumped to his defense repeating his talking points and adding their own inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, Republican member of Congress from Georgia, invoked the Civil War in denouncing the search on Twitter. In another tweet she said there is an “extremely high probability” that the FBI planted “evidence” during the search, a conspiracy theory suggested by Trump himself.\n\nAt the local level, politicians like Dan Cox, the Trump-backed Republican candidate for governor of Maryland, joined the chorus by denouncing the search as “police state tactics” and called on “Maryland Republicans” to condemn the search.\n\nCox might not seem like he adds much, but as he and other candidates across the country talk to reporters in their cities and states about the search, they localize Trump’s words in a way that can often give them the kind of heightened credibility a local TV anchorperson might have.\n\nOne narrative favored by some in mainstream media says the “walls are closing in” on Trump. That might be true. But it would be a mistake not to also note and pay careful attention to the loud, angry and powerful right-wing voices pushing back throughout several layers of media against those walls. If January 6 taught us nothing else, it is how quickly the members of this MAGA cadre can be moved from words to action through the messaging of their leader.", "authors": ["David Zurawik"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/media/disney-right-wing-media-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Demonizing Disney: Fox and right-wing media attack the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nThe right-wing media machine has a new villain: Disney.\n\nRight now Fox News, conservative talk radio, and a constellation of right-wing websites and influencers are all training their firepower on the entertainment giant. Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s belated stand against Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill has given way to right-wing media portraying the company as a “woke” organization seeking to “groom” children with what they characterize as a radical LGBTQ agenda.\n\nYes – really – Disney. The family-friendly, fun-for-everyone, intentionally inoffensive brand is being challenged like never before, largely by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP politicians who are playing to the cameras to raise their own profiles.\n\n“They have a sexual agenda for six-year-old children,” Fox host Tucker Carlson declared on Wednesday night. “You’d think that’s illegal in some way. It’s certainly immoral. It’s creepy as hell. And yet they are the country’s leading purveyor of children’s programming. That’s a problem, no?”\n\nLater in his show, Carlson spoke about executives at Disney who have sought to normalize LGBTQ lifestyles by representing them in movies and other projects. “Sounds like the behavior of a sex offender,” Carlson said. “Normal people do not sexualize underage children.”\n\nCarlson’s rant is just one of many examples. An hour earlier, Fox host Jesse Watters made similar arguments, dubbing the company’s theme parks as “The Wokest Place on Earth.” The truth is that characterizing Disney as a creepy company which aims to morally bankrupt kids – an extreme position – has become quite mainstream in GOP media circles.\n\nWhile Disney (DIS) employees and others initially hammered Disney (DIS) for not taking a strong stance on the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, the opposite is now true on the right…\n\nHow much will it impact business?\n\nIt might be tempting to dismiss these attacks on Disney as irrelevant to the company’s bottom line, but I think that would ignore the very real power held by the talking heads and entities attacking the company. We saw over the last six years how effective these same players were at convincing a not-so-insignificant swath of the country that news from reputable sources was “fake.” That assault certainly impacted how conservative Americans view mainstream news outlets.\n\nThat’s not to say that the same fate will meet Disney. It’s possible that this assault will blow over in a few days or weeks. And Disney’s footing in American culture is strong, with its ownership of brands such as “Star Wars” and Marvel. Disney has historically been seen as both family-friendly and, in a more specific way, gay-friendly. Those two identities are not in conflict. Rather, they shouldn’t be, but DeSantis and others seem to be creating a conflict.\n\nConsider this: Just as the “1619 Project” was successfully demonized by Fox and others, what is to say that Disney will be unscathed? If the right-wing media apparatus is able to put a sour taste in the minds of the millions who turn to it for news, that could spell at least some bad news for Disney…\n\nThe Daily Wire’s $100 million bet\n\nWhile the right is waging an all-out war on Disney, at least one company is seeking to take advantage of it. The Daily Wire, the right-wing media organization, announced in a press release that it will “invest a minimum of $100 million over the next three years into a line of live-action and animated children’s entertainment on its streaming platform.” The company said such content, which it disclosed had been in the works for months, will be available to its subscribers in 2023. As Axios’ Sara Fischer noted, the company has “pushed into entertainment” as a way “to attract paid subscribers.”\n\nIn making the decision to develop children’s content, Daily Wire co-CEO Jeremy Boreing said, “Americans are tired of giving their money to woke corporations who hate them. They’re tired of giving their money to woke media companies who want to indoctrinate their children with radical race and gender theory. But they want to do more than just cancel them. They want alternatives. The Daily Wire is giving them those alternatives.”\n\nThe QAnon factor\n\nIt is difficult to ignore the QAnon factor at work. The political movement reshaped the GOP in significant ways, helping to mainline the notion inside the party that elites are sexual deviants seeking to exploit kids. This type of story, that Disney is a woke company used by the liberal Hollywood elite to indoctrinate children with radical gender theories, feeds right into that broad theory and reinforces it. Fox and others in the right-wing media galaxy might not directly be promoting QAnon, but they are without question throwing up the Bat-Signal to its fans.\n\n>> Here’s a good background piece published last year from BuzzFeed’s Otilla Steadman: “Conspiracy theories about sex trafficking and child abuse have been a core feature of the online fever swamp that bloomed under Trump, acting as a powerful recruitment tool and call to action…”\n\nFox’s own LGBTQ activism\n\nWhile Fox’s talk channel blasts Disney for advancing a pro-LGBTQ agenda, it apparently forgets — or chooses not to mention — that it belongs to an organization that also boasts about its own “commitment” to “championing” such communities. On Fox Corp’s website, as flagged by MMFA’s John Whitehouse, the company, for instance, brags that it has received a 100% rating by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, giving Fox “the distinction of ‘Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.’”\n\nThe company adds that it has been recognized as a “Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Company.” It even goes as far as to say that it seeks out to “build business opportunities and lasting relationships” with companies owned by LGBTQ individuals. “IT’S ALL ABOUT PRIDE,” the company says in its “corporate social responsibility” report. I asked a Fox Corp. spox on Wednesday how the company can square the two messages, but didn’t hear back…\n\nFurther reading\n\n– Chapek’s missteps have fueled a “confidence crisis at Disney,” Kim Masters writes.

He wasn't advocating for another civil war, he was only repeating what he had heard, he told listeners.\n\nAfter a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, provoking outraged sputtering from Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives alike, Limbaugh stood out in dismissing the controversy.\n\n\"We're supposed to be horrified by the protesters,\" Limbaugh scoffed on his program Jan. 7. \"There's a lot of people out there calling for the end of violence ... lot of conservatives, social media, who say that any violence or aggression at all is unacceptable regardless of the circumstances. ... I am glad Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, the actual tea-party guys, the men at Lexington and Concord, didn't feel that way.”\n\nLove him or loathe him, few would deny that Limbaugh was one of the most influential commercial broadcasters, if not the most influential, in American history, said Michael Harrison, founder and publisher of Talkers trade magazine, which covers talk radio.\n\nHarrison said Limbaugh's legacy – his impact on public policy, on the national culture and on GOP politicians from the presidency on down – remains unmatched.\n\n“Limbaugh’s radio talent and dedication to the medium are unparalleled in the modern talk industry,\" he said. \"At a time when the very future of radio and its talent pool could very much be on the wane in terms of cultural relevance and prestige, he raised it to a level of importance on a par with the most influential media platforms and players of our time.”\n\nJournalist Ze'ev Chafets, whose 2010 biography of Limbaugh (\"Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One\") grew out of a New York Times magazine cover story in 2008, said Limbaugh was one of the top two or three most important figures in Republican politics in the 1990s.\n\n\"The reason is his show was heard in every congressional district in the country, and certainly every state, by a huge number of Republicans who almost entirely made up his audience,\" Chafets said. \"He was able, at a granular level, to affect elections. The year Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House (1994), he gave Limbaugh an honorary membership in (the Republican caucus in) Congress because of his influence.\"\n\n\"Coastal Americans\" who didn’t listen to Limbaugh had no idea of his \"gravitational pull\" because they underestimated his communication talents and his smarts, at least initially, Chafets said.\n\n\"They didn’t understand because they thought he was a carnival barker talking to rubes,\" Chafets said. \"He talked about issues, not gossip. His show (consisted of) three-hour monologues without notes and included minute details about arcane matters that most talk show hosts could not do.\"\n\nHe was original, he was funny and he was adept at assembling key elements of broadcasting to produce entertaining and compelling radio, Harrison said.\n\n\"He was a consummate pro, and even people who disagreed with him politically, most who are honest will tell you what a great broadcaster he (was),\" Harrison said. \"Because he used so many elements of great radio: pacing, his voice, satire, sound effects. The flow and feel of his show was very appealing in his use of sound and broadcast principles.\"\n\nLimbaugh's show was the most listened-to talk radio broadcast in the USA, bringing a cumulative weekly audience of about 15.5 million listeners at his peak, according to Talkers' tracking. \"No one beats Rush in the political news talk radio format – he’s No. 1,\" Harrison said.\n\nHis was a life and career of wild success pockmarked by controversies and health calamities, including years of chronic back pain and unsuccessful surgery, leading to long-term prescription opioid addiction and 30 days in rehab in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, he was criminally investigated and arrested for alleged \"doctor shopping\" to obtain multiple prescriptions in Florida, a charge dropped after a plea agreement and his promise to continue addiction treatment (although Limbaugh maintained his innocence).\n\nIn 2001, he announced he had gone deaf over three months for unknown reasons, although his doctors said it could have been from years of drug addiction. He had cochlear implants to restore some of his hearing.\n\nThen lung cancer struck. Limbaugh gave his legions of fans plenty of advance notice of the coming end. On Oct. 20, he told listeners his cancer was terminal.\n\n“You measure a happy life against whatever medication it takes. And at some point, you decide, you know, this medication may be working, but I hate the way I feel every day,” Limbaugh said on the air. “I’m not there yet. But it is part and parcel of this.\n\n\"It’s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I’m under a death sentence are over.”\n\nHis listeners were shocked when he revealed his diagnosis on his show in February 2020, not long after being told on Jan. 20 the grim news by \"two medical institutions.\"\n\n\"This day has been one of the most difficult days in recent memory for me. I've known this moment is coming in the program. ... I'm sure that you all know by now that I really don't like talking about myself and I don't like making things about me,\" Limbaugh said. \"I like this program to be about you and the things that matter to all of us.\"\n\nBut, he said, he knew he had to explain what was going on in his life because listeners would be curious if he wasn't at his usual post every day. Even though he had no symptoms at that time, he realized that would not last and he would have to be absent for treatment.\n\n\"It’s not that I want to fool anybody, it’s just that I don’t want to burden anybody with it and I haven’t wanted to,\" he said. \"But it is what it is. You know me, I’m the mayor of Realville.\"\n\nA day later, he was visibly moved when President Trump, his longtime friend and Florida neighbor, awarded him the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, during a State of the Union address in the House of Representatives.\n\nAttending as one of Trump's \"special guests,\" the white-bearded and ruddy-faced Limbaugh sat in the House gallery next to first lady Melania Trump, who fastened the medal on a blue ribbon around his neck.\n\n\"In recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you do for charity, I’m proud to announce tonight that you will receive our nation’s highest civilian honor,\" Trump said to applause in the chamber.\n\nIn May, Limbaugh updated his listeners on the state of his health with a candid assessment.\n\n\"I vowed not to be a cancer patient on the radio. I vowed to shield as much of that from the daily program as I can,\" Limbaugh said before talking about his third wave of treatment. \"I have to tell you, it's kicking my ass.\"\n\nHe said the previous week of treatments left him \"virtually worthless\" and \"virtually useless.\" He hadn't left the house or done much of anything, as doctors warned him would happen.\n\n\"It's the price that you pay if you make the decision to go ahead and do treatment to try to prolong your life,\" he said, adding that he was doing \"extremely well, all things considered.\"\n\nThen came his grim assessment in October. He tried to be upbeat, but the progression of the cancer and the treatment had not been easy.\n\n\"Some days are harder than others,\" he said. \"I do get fatigued now. I do get very, very tired now. I’m not gonna mislead you about that. But I am extremely grateful to be able to come here to the studio and to maintain as much normalcy as possible – and it’s still true.\"\n\nThe day before Christmas 2020, on his final show of the year, he updated listeners on his health again, saying he hadn't expected to make it past October, let alone into December. \"And yet here I am and today, got some problems, but I'm feeling pretty good today. … God knows how important this program is for me today,\" he said, thanking listeners.\n\nLimbaugh is survived by his fourth wife, Kathryn Rogers, whom he married in 2010. Three previous marriages ended in divorce. He did not have children.\n\nBorn on Jan. 12, 1951, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Rush Hudson Limbaugh III came from a line of conservative Republicans that included lawyers, judges and ambassadors. His family looked askance at his early yen – while still in grammar school – to become a radio star.\n\n“I said, ‘Pop, I love this. I know I'm great at it. I'm gonna get even better,’” Limbaugh told interviewers later.\n\nWhen he was 9, he got a toy radio as a gift and began \"broadcasting\" on AM frequencies in his home, entertaining his family playing DJ with his records. In high school, he worked as a DJ at a station co-owned by his father. He lasted only one year at Southeast Missouri State University before leaving to pursue a career in radio.\n\nIt did not go well at first. He was fired from stations in Missouri and Pennsylvania for being too controversial as a news commentator. In the mid-1980s, he landed at KFBK in Sacramento, California, as an on-air host. Within a year, he was Sacramento's top radio host.\n\nThe repeal of the Federal Communications Commission's Fairness Doctrine in 1987 gave Limbaugh his head to broadcast his controversial opinions without having to present opposing views. In July 1988, he launched his own show on a talk station in New York City, and he was off to the races: His star was rising, and people noticed.\n\n\"A large new noise echoes across the invisible cacophony that is talk radio,\" Louis Grossberger reported in The New York Times in December 1990. \"His subject is politics. His stance: conservative. His persona: comic blowhard. His style: a schizoid spritz, bouncing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian.\"\n\nLimbaugh demonstrated his fervent support for the Persian Gulf War by ridiculing anyone who sought peace. His show was moved to stations with larger audiences until Limbaugh was broadcasting on more than 650 stations nationwide. The election of President Bill Clinton in 1992 only fueled the possibilities of lacerating satire aimed at Democrats.\n\nEver since, Limbaugh maintained his position as the king of talk radio while fending off multiple flaps over controversial things he said on the air, about racial and ethnic minorities, feminism and the notion of sexual consent, environmentalism and climate change, his admiration for Trump and his disdain for President Barack Obama; Limbaugh was an on-air superspreader of the \"birtherism\" lie that Obama was not born in the USA, and called activist women \"feminazis.\"\n\nSome of the harsh things he said, including blatant bigotry, helped fuel his popularity. He played the song “Barack the Magic Negro” (set to the tune of “Puff, the Magic Dragon”) on his show to depict Obama as someone who “makes guilty whites feel good” and is “black, but not authentically.”\n\nWhen actor Michael J. Fox, suffering from Parkinson’s disease, appeared in a Democratic campaign commercial, Limbaugh mocked his tremors. As the AIDS epidemic raged in the 1980s, he made dying a punchline. He called 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton a dog.\n\nMost of the controversies rolled off him, except for Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student who testified in Congress in 2012 in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraceptives. Limbaugh mocked her, suggesting this view made her a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute.\"\n\n\"That was the most damaging thing he ever did,\" Harrison said. The outcry that followed kicked off boycotts by major sponsors of talk radio, even though Limbaugh issued a rare apology for \"insulting word choices.\"\n\n\"It had a terrible economic impact on the talk radio business in general,\" Harrison said. \"It's the one major blemish on his history that hurt his fellow broadcasters. Now he's been forgiven because of what he's done for the industry that outweighs that.\"\n\nIn between doing his show and advising Republican presidents and candidates, Limbaugh wrote best-selling books (\"The Way Things Ought to Be\" in 1992, followed in 1993 by \"See, I Told You So\"), including a series of children's books.\n\nHe supported several charities, including a telethon for leukemia and lymphoma, the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation and the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which honors firefighters who died saving others in the 9/11 terrorist attack on the twin towers in New York.\n\nChafets, who grew up in Michigan, remembers when he first heard Limbaugh on the radio as he was driving one day near Detroit.\n\n\"Before Rush Limbaugh, you could not hear conservative thought on the radio in the USA – Rush is the first guy to provide that, the rock-and-roll DJ with the news. And that shocked people,\" Chafets said. \"I could not believe it myself. I actually pulled over to listen to what he was saying. I couldn’t believe it.\"\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/media/bernard-shaw-obituary/index.html", "title": "CNN anchor Bernard Shaw dead at 82 | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer CNN anchor Bernard Shaw died Wednesday at a Washington, DC, hospital of pneumonia unrelated to Covid-19, Shaw’s family announced Thursday. Shaw was 82.\n\nShaw was CNN’s first chief anchor and was with the network when it launched on June 1, 1980. He retired from CNN after more than 20 years on February 28, 2001.\n\nDuring his storied career, Shaw reported on some of the biggest stories of that time – including the student revolt in Tiananmen Square in May 1989, the First Gulf war live from Baghdad in 1991, and the 2000 presidential election.\n\n“CNN’s beloved anchor and colleague, Bernard Shaw, passed away yesterday at the age of 82. Bernie was a CNN original and was our Washington Anchor when we launched on June 1st, 1980,” Chris Licht, CNN Chairman and CEO, said in a statement Thursday. “He was our lead anchor for the next twenty years from anchoring coverage of presidential elections to his iconic coverage of the First Gulf War live from Baghdad in 1991. Even after he left CNN, Bernie remained a close member of our CNN family providing our viewers with context about historic events as recently as last year. The condolences of all of us at CNN go out to his wife Linda and his children.”\n\nFuneral services for Shaw will be closed to family and invited guests only, with a public memorial service planned at a later time, his family said.\n\nThe family requested donations to a scholarship fund in lieu of flowers, according to a statement provided by former CNN CEO Tom Johnson. “The Shaw family requests complete privacy at this time,” the family added in the statement.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson said Shaw “exemplified excellence in his life” and will be “remembered as a fierce advocate of responsible journalism.”\n\n“As a journalist, he demanded accuracy and fairness in news coverage. He earned the respect of millions of viewers around the world for his integrity and independence. He resisted forcefully any lowering of ethical news standards or any compromise of solid news coverage. He always could be trusted as a reporter and as an anchor,” Johnson said.\n\n“Bernie was my personal friend and colleague for more than 55 years. I will miss him enormously,” he added. “My wife Edwina and I extend our most genuine condolences to Bernie’s wife Linda and to his family.”\n\nEarly career\n\nCNN founder Ted Turner (center/right) stands with anchors Larry King (L), Judy Woodruff and Bernard Shaw (R) after receiving an award at a CNN 20th anniversary gala event at Philips Arena in Atlanta on June 1, 2000. Tami Chappell/Reuters\n\nShaw was born May 22, 1940, in Chicago to Edgar and Camilla Shaw.\n\nHe spent four years in the Marine Corps, during which he was stationed in Hawaii when he sought out TV news legend Walter Cronkite for advice about how to become a journalist.\n\nShaw got his career start as a radio reporter in Chicago, during which he interviewed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who told him, “One day you’ll make it, just do some good,” Shaw recalled.\n\nHis first job in TV was as a political reporter for CBS, helping cover the Watergate scandal. He’d later become ABC’s Latin America correspondent and bureau chief, where he and his team captured the only aerial pictures of the massacre at Jonestown, Guyana.\n\nHe left ABC to take a job with Ted Turner’s Cable News Network, the world’s first 24-hour television news network – a decision he said many of his former colleagues thought was crazy. “I thought it was the last frontier in network television news,” he had said.\n\nTurner remembered Shaw in a statement Thursday evening after learning of his passing.\n\n“Bernie was a pioneer, a consummate professional and one of the most respected journalists in the country. As a masterful mentor whose calm and disciplined demeanor provided the perfect tone for historic coverage that would define his twenty-plus year career at CNN – his legacy will live on in the work and minds of so many journalists around the world,” Turner wrote, expressing condolences to Shaw’s family. “The world has lost a hero for democracy and truth.”\n\n‘Boys of Baghdad’\n\nShaw is often credited with raising CNN’s international prominence and turning CNN into the news leader it is today. He was also known for being cool under pressure – which was exemplified with his coverage of the First Gulf War.\n\nHe and fellow reporters, John Holliman and Peter Arnett, made TV history by broadcasting the night of the first attack in Baghdad in real-time, and would become known as the “Boys of Baghdad.”\n\n“The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We’re seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky,” Shaw said, reporting from a Baghdad hotel as bombs rained down.\n\nArnett recalled how in the first moments of the bombing: “I raced for the microphone, and here was Bernie – ‘Atlanta, come to Baghdad, come to Baghdad.’”\n\n“He had the microphone first, the instinct to broadcast, to be there,” Arnett said. “He didn’t hesitate. He scooped the world.”\n\nShaw told NPR in 2014 that “one of the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking out.”\n\n“The more intense the news story I cover, the cooler I want to be. The more I ratchet down my emotions, even the tone of voice because people are depending on you for accuracy, dispassionate descriptions of what’s happening. And it would be a disservice to the consumers of news – be they readers, listeners or viewers – for me to become emotional and to get carried away,” he said.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman (L), Republican presidential candidate Richard Cheney (R) join moderator Bernard Shaw of CNN on stage for their debate at Centre College's Norton Center for the Arts in Danville, Kentucky 05 October, 2000.

Tannen Maury/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN made its debut with Shaw as its Washington anchor at a time when other networks had White males as their lead anchors.\n\nAfter less than a year on air for CNN, Shaw led the network’s coverage of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. When the other networks reported that White House press secretary James Brady had been killed, Shaw held off on reporting until he received official confirmation – which never came and the other networks had to retract.\n\nShaw also earned a reputation for conducting tough interviews. His sharp questioning was on display when, in 1988, he became the first African American journalist to moderate a presidential debate.\n\nIn the second showdown between then-Vice President George H. W. Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, Shaw asked the candidates to speak about the death penalty.\n\nWhen Dukakis said he was against the death penalty, Shaw asked: “If Kitty Dukakis (Dukakis’ wife) were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?”\n\nThe question was duped a candidate career killer and, some thought, changed the trajectory of the race.\n\nCNN anchorman Bernard Shaw talks to his viewers while on set at the network's Atlanta headquarters on Friday, Nov. 10, 2000. Shaw, a 20-year veteran of CNN, said he would leave the network early next year to write books and spend more time with his family. Erik S. Lesser/AP\n\nShaw signs off\n\nShaw announced in November 2000 he would be stepping back at CNN to spend time with his family and to write books.\n\n“My best time has been simply being here, helping to do what attracts you, our viewers, your demand to be informed instantly with knowledgeable context and insight. And to you around the world and across our great land here in the United States, more than your praise I have valued your criticism and your suggestions. Scrutiny can be instructive,” he told viewers.\n\n“Harder than entering this business, is leaving it and leaving CNN, especially after 20 years here. But you know, some roses are so fragrant. And as a gardener, I want to grow and smell them more – when I’m not writing.”\n\nShaw was the recipient of many awards for his journalism including the Edward R. Murrow Award for Lifetime Achievement Award in Broadcasting and was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\n“We were a team. That is the only way the network succeeded. That is the only way the network made history,” he told CNN staff and alumni at the celebration of CNN’s 35th anniversary in Atlanta in 2015. “We succeeded because you made excellence a habit. You did that every day … you soldiered on.”\n\nShaw said he always believed that the “most important chair was not the anchor chair.”\n\n“The most important chair was the chair at the assignment desk. The most important chair was the audio person’s chair, the director’s chair, the editor’s chair, the reporter’s chair.”\n\nHis advice to employees: “Make a promise that when you show up at work as a CNN employee you will work to take excellence one step beyond.”\n\nShaw is survived by his wife Linda and their two children, Amar Edgar and Anil Louise.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/perspectives/late-night-television-streaming/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Late-night television's golden age is over | CNN Business", "text": "Editor’s Note: Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN, covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years, and has written four books on TV, including The Late Shift and The War for Late Night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nIn July, TBS announced that, after seven seasons, “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” would not be returning, and Desus Nice and The Kid Mero disclosed that their Showtime show, “Desus & Mero,” was ending. That news came just months after James Corden revealed that he’d be leaving “The Late Late Show” and about a year after Conan O’Brien decided to say goodbye to late-night after almost 30 years.\n\nIf late-night television had a true golden age, we probably passed it sometime in the past decade. After a period of what looked like unchecked expansion, with new late-night shows popping up like wildflowers (or sometimes weeds), the reaper seems to have arrived. Late night’s future is now looking much more limited, if not completely grim.\n\nThe genre’s winnowing arguably began with Jon Stewart’s decision in 2015 to walk away from “The Daily Show,” which he hosted for more than 16 years. Unlike David Letterman and Jay Leno, who both stayed on well into their 60s, Stewart was only 52 when he stepped away. And O’Brien was only 58.\n\nWhile Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon are still around as network hosts, their ratings have certainly taken a hit, especially among audiences between the ages of 18 and 54. And among the newer hosts who are still surviving, it seems unlikely many will have runs anywhere near as long as the recent legends.\n\nLosing hosts of color, like Nice and The Kid Mero, and Bee, the most prominent woman host since Joan Rivers in the 1980s, is also not a sign of a prospering genre. At least Amber Ruffin, who broke out on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” and is now starring in her own show on Peacock, has made a strong start.\n\nAnd while it speaks to the trend of political partisans gravitating toward like-minded TV, Greg Gutfeld’s late-night show on Fox News has been a breakout hit for the network.\n\nWhat’s happening to late-night TV? The gradual shift away from linear TV to streaming does not look hospitable to traditional late-night shows, which lean heavily on jokes about news of the day and topical comedy. Streaming shows by nature are not about immediacy and go for broader relevance over longer periods of time.\n\nThat describes “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” the much-honored once-a-week show on HBO. It is a beloved series, but shares only part of its DNA with the rest of late night. It’s extremely serious about being funny, as it explores heavyweight news topics with investigative reporting techniques.\n\nIt is certainly an appealing format. Stewart has returned with a similar news-centric show on Apple TV+. Letterman has a pure interview show on Netflix. The streaming nature of these shows underscores they are not cut from the familiar cloth of comedy-centric late night.\n\nSome critics attribute at least some of the slackening interest in late night to the overload of political commentary during the years of Donald Trump-dominated news. But Trump was so target-rich, he made political neutrality an almost impossible position for late-night hosts (some of whom he attacked personally).\n\nBut the fundamental issue with the future of late night is economics. One reason the shows thrived — even when so ubiquitous — was they were dependable money-makers. A solid, five-hour-a-week series in late night attracted good ad dollars; and the budgets, beyond big host salaries, were manageable.\n\nRatings have declined so much, however, (Leno and Letterman once had audiences much larger than Colbert has today) that the cash spigot is mostly trickling now, according to what a long-time executive producer of a hit late-night series told me several years ago. It’s surely worse now.\n\nThe essential problem, of course, is fewer and fewer people watch linear TV. They stream, or watch clips online. The drive to catch Letterman or Stewart every night is not there anymore, especially among college guys, a prime target for late-night advertisers. Audiences for late-night shows are older now, which makes them less valuable in the eyes of advertisers.\n\nThat doesn’t mean late-night shows are going away. The format is too efficient for eradication. The subscription model is still reaching viewers who like late night. Fallon just hit the 30 million subscriber mark on YouTube. Viewers still enjoy selective parts of a late-night show (usually the comedy), but don’t commit to watching the entire show when it airs.\n\nMaybe the genre will shrink all the way down to just a few shows. Depending on how many entrants leave the arena, the survivors may be able to take advantage of grabbing the viewers still interested in some laughs before bed.", "authors": ["Opinion Bill Carter For Cnn Business Perspectives"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/04/5-things-you-need-know-tuesday/30995517/", "title": "5 things you need to know Tuesday", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n1.

Fox, which will host the event with Facebook in Cleveland on Thursday, will average the five most recent polls from \"major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\" For the candidates who don't make the top spots, a smaller debate will be held several hours before the main event. And the methodology for choosing candidates doesn't go without drama: Former IRS commissioner Mark Everson, a GOP candidate, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, alleging that he has been unfairly excluded from the debate.\n\n3.

Sentencing phase begins in trial of Colo. theater shooter\n\nThe final phase is set to begin in the trial of James Holmes, who killed 12 and injured 70 in a shooting at a crowded movie theater in the Denver suburbs three years ago. Jurors have already convicted the 27-year-old former University of Colorado neuroscience researcher of first-degree murder, and Monday they took less than three hours to reject any mitigating factors put forward by the defense to rule out the death penalty. Emotional testimony is expected from victims and families who will argue in favor of the death penalty before the jurors make their sentencing decision. If a single juror decides against the death penalty, Holmes will be sentenced to life in prison.\n\n5.

The family has accused the English star of violating their copyright, claiming his 2014 hit bore “striking similarities” and “overt common elements” to the famed Gaye track. The lawsuit was originally filed in 2017.\n\nSheeran, in a dark suit and tie and his trademark ginger locks, was adamant that he had come up with the song himself, sparring at times with the plaintiff's attorney, Keisha Rice, on the subject of “independent creation.”\n\n'I didn't want to live anymore':Ed Sheeran details struggles with depression, drugs, bulimia\n\nIn response to video played in the courtroom, which showed the musician segueing onstage between the two songs, Sheeran noted it was very common for musicians to weave other artists' songs into their live shows.\n\n“I’d be an idiot to stand on a stage in front of 20,000 people and do that,” Sheeran said about the accusation that he copied songs.\n\nEarlier in the day, a lawyer for Townsend's heirs, Ben Crump, had told jurors that the merging of the two songs was tantamount to “a confession.”\n\n“We have a smoking gun,” he said of the concert footage showing Sheeran flipping between the two songs. Crump added that the case was about “giving credit where credit is due.”\n\nSheeran looked on as his lawyer, Ilene Farkas, insisted that Sheeran and a co-writer, Amy Wadge, wrote their song independently and did not steal from Townsend and Gaye.\n\nShe said they “created this heartfelt song without copying ‘Let’s Get It On.'”\n\nTaylor Swift 'Shake It Off' copyright infringement lawsuitdismissed by judge\n\nWhat jurors are deciding on in the copyright trial\n\nThe trial began Monday with jury selection. It is expected to last up to two weeks in the Manhattan federal courtroom of 95-year-old Judge Louis L. Stanton.\n\nWhile the jury will hear the recordings of both songs, probably many times, their lyrics — and vibes — are legally insignificant. Jurors are supposed to only consider the raw elements of melody, harmony and rhythm that make up the composition of \"Let's Get It On,\" as documented on sheet music filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" is the quintessential, sexy slow jam that's been heard in countless films and commercials and garnered hundreds of millions of streams, spins and radio plays over the past 50 years. \"Thinking Out Loud,\" which won a Grammy for song of the year, is a much more marital take on love and sex.\n\nSheeran's attorneys have said the songs' undeniable structural symmetry points only to the foundations of popular music.\n\n\"The two songs share versions of a similar and unprotectable chord progression that was freely available to all songwriters,\" they said in a court filing.\n\nTownsend family attorneys pointed out in the lawsuit that artists including Boyz II Men have performed seamless mashups of the two songs, and that even Sheeran himself has segued into \"Let's Get It On\" during live performances of \"Thinking Out Loud.\"\n\n'Subtract':Ed Sheeran says his upcoming album is a 'trapdoor' into his soul and anxious mind\n\nGaye's estate is not involved in the case, though it will inevitably have echoes of their successful lawsuit against Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams and T.I. over the resemblance of their 2013 hit \"Blurred Lines\" to Gaye's 1977 \"Got to Give it Up.\" A jury awarded Gaye's heirs $7.4 million at trial — later trimmed by a judge to $5.3 million — making it among the most significant copyright cases in recent decades.\n\nSheeran's label Atlantic Records and Sony/ATV Music Publishing are also named as defendants in the \"Thinking Out Loud\" lawsuit. Generally, plaintiffs in copyright lawsuits cast a wide net in naming defendants, though a judge can eliminate any names deemed inappropriate. In this case, however, Sheeran's co-writer on the song, Amy Wadge, was never named.\n\nTownsend, who also wrote the 1958 R&B doo-wop hit \"For Your Love,\" was a singer, songwriter and lawyer. He died in 2003. Kathryn Townsend Griffin, his daughter, is the plaintiff leading the lawsuit.\n\n“I think Mr. Sheeran is a great artist with a great future,” she said in her testimony, adding that she didn't want it to get to this point of the case. “But I have to protect my father’s legacy.”\n\nInspiration or infringement?Songwriters clashing in court more often after 'Blurred Lines'\n\nAlready a Motown superstar in the 1960s before his more adult 1970s output made him a generational musical giant, Gaye was killed in 1984 at age 44, shot by his father as he tried to intervene in a fight between his parents.\n\nEd Sheeran has faced a copyright trial before\n\nMajor artists are often hit with lawsuits alleging song-stealing, but nearly all settle before trial — as Taylor Swift recently did over \"Shake it Off,\" ending a lawsuit that lasted years longer and came closer to trial than most other cases.\n\nBut Sheeran — whose musical style drawing from classic soul, pop and R&B has made him a target for copyright lawsuits — has shown a willingness to go to trial before. A year ago, he won a U.K. copyright battle over his 2017 hit \"Shape of You,\" then slammed what he described as a \"culture\" of baseless lawsuits intended to squeeze money out of artists eager to avoid the expense of a trial.\n\n\"I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there is no basis for the claim,\" Sheeran said in a video posted on Twitter after the verdict. \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry.\"\n\nThe \"Thinking Out Loud\" lawsuit also invokes one of the most common tropes in American and British music since the earliest days of rock 'n' roll, R&B and hip-hop: a young white artist seemingly appropriating the work of an older Black artist — accusations that were also levied at Elvis Presley and The Beatles, whose music drew on that of Black forerunners.\n\n\"Mr. Sheeran blatantly took a Black artist's music who he doesn't view as worthy as compensation,\" Crump said at a March 31 news conference.\n\nFrom 2022:Ed Sheeran says 'baseless claims' are 'damaging' to songwriting industry after copyright win\n\nEd Sheeran, Elton John and the power of male celebritiesspeaking out about eating disorders", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/entertainment/taylor-swift-music-copyright-cases/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift and 5 of the most famous music copyright cases | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: The documentary “Taking On Taylor Swift” examines the copyright lawsuit against the singer for her hit song “Shake it Off.” Produced by the CNN FlashDocs unit, the hour-long special premieres Friday, December 23, at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\nMusic is supposed to soothe the savage beast, but it can also get some people riled up.\n\nEspecially, when it comes to copyright cases.\n\nThroughout the history of the music industry, there have been incidents of artists accused of ripping off the works of others.\n\nTaylor Swift had been embroiled in such a case since 2017, when songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler sued her over her massive single, “Shake It Off.” The duo alleged that Swift’s hit contains similarities to their 2001 song, “Playas Gon’ Play,” which they wrote wrote for the girl group 3LW.\n\nThe suit was reportedly dismissed on December 12 at the request of attorneys for both sides, though no details of a settlement, if there is one, have been released publicly.\n\nHere are five other famous copyright cases:\n\nLed Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway to Heaven’\n\nJohn Paul Jones, John Bonham, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin pose in front of an their private airliner The Starship, in 1973.

The case wove it’s way through the legal system for years.\n\nTwo years ago, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a jury verdict that found that “Stairway to Heaven” had not been lifted from “Taurus.”\n\n“There are zillions and zillions of songs that are carrying the same chord progression, so it was very unfortunate, and it was unpleasant for everybody,” Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant said in 2021 during an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s “Loose Ends.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s ‘Blurred Lines’ featuring Pharrell Williams and T.I.\n\nPharrell Williams and Robin Thicke.

The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, plus Bowie and members of Queen received songwriting credit.\n\nBowie died in 2016 at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer.\n\nBiz Markie’s ‘Alone Again’\n\nBiz Markie in 2017.

Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nEd Sheeran has had a robust career in recent years, including being accused of plagiarism more than once.\n\nHe was sued in 2016 over his single “Photograph,” a case that was eventually settled out of court.\n\nBeginning that same year, the British singer/songwriter was hit with multiple allegations over his hit, “Thinking Out Loud.”\n\nBut Sheeran recently notched a win when a London judge ruled that his 2017 hit song, “Shape of You,” did not copy grime artist Sami Switch’s song, “Oh Why,” as Switch had alleged.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/22/gosnell-abortion-trial/2100103/", "title": "Gruesome testimony renews debate over abortion", "text": "Rick Hampson, USA TODAY\n\nDoctor%27s abortion clinic described by prosecutors as a house of horrors\n\nAbortion foes say mainstream news media haven%27t covered trial adequately\n\nDoctor%27s attorney says his client is victim of prosecutorial lynching\n\nPHILADELPHIA — One clinic worker testified that she saw aborted fetuses moving, breathing and, once, \"screeching.\" Another described a 2-foot-long fetus that \"didn't have eyes or a mouth, but it was like … making this noise. … It sounded like a little alien.\"\n\nA third witness recalled how, as ordered, she used surgical scissors to snip the spine of an aborted fetus she'd found in a toilet, its arm still moving. \"I did it once, and I didn't do it again,\" she said. \"…it gave me the creeps.\"\n\nThe creeps are an occupational hazard for jurors in the murder trial of Kermit Gosnell, accused of running a clinic where seven babies were allegedly killed after botched abortions and an adult patient was given a fatal overdose of Demerol.\n\nAbortion opponents hope that the horrifying crimes attributed to this one defendant can shift the balance of power in an abortion debate that's been deadlocked for decades.\n\nThe most recent Gallup poll reflects no marked change from those taken decades ago: 52% of Americans say abortion should be legal in some circumstances; 28% say legal in all circumstances; 18% say it should be illegal in all circumstances. It's an issue that hasn't been resolved and hasn't gone away — \"a constant agitating of the American soul,\" in the words of columnist Peggy Noonan.\n\nIn the Gosnell trial, \"the debate suddenly has a visual argument,\" says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that supports anti-abortion political candidates. \"You look at pictures, and you think, 'That's a baby.' \"\n\nOne photo, taken by a clinic worker and shown at the trial, showed a fetus whose gestational age was estimated by the medical examiner at 28 weeks at the time of the abortion. When it was placed in a pan, its body curled up in the fetal position. Gosnell, former staffer Kareema Cross testified, joked, \"The baby's big enough that it could walk to the store.\"\n\nThe prosecution rested Thursday. The defense, which begins this week, will try to show that there were no live births at the clinic — that the fetuses were aborted in utero — and that the adult patient died of unforeseen complications. It's unclear whether Gosnell will take the stand.\n\nAbortion opponents, such as USA TODAY opinion contributor Kirsten Powers, complained about what they said was insufficient coverage by established news organizations. (There has since been an increase in trial coverage.) Abortion rights advocates respond that the gruesome case suggests a need for wider access to abortion, not less. They say the trial depicts abortion not as it is, but as it was before the procedure was legalized by the Supreme Court in 1973 in Roe v. Wade, and as it will be again if Roe is reversed.\n\n\"I've never heard of this anywhere else,\" says Eric Ferrero of Planned Parenthood, which provides reproduction-related health services, including abortions. \"There aren't Gosnells operating all over the country. This case is as unusual as it is unspeakable.\"\n\nHow can he be sure? asks Anna Higgins of the Family Research Council, an anti-abortion group. \"We don't have regular inspections in most states. … Is there infanticide?\"\n\nABORTION RESTRICTIONS EXPAND\n\nThe trial coincides with a campaign by abortion opponents, who were frustrated by the issue's relative obscurity in the 2012 presidential election, to restrict abortion on the state level.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says that this year, 300 bills designed to restrict abortion access have been proposed in 42 states. This comes after a record 135 abortion restrictions passed by state legislatures over the previous two years, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nDespite Democratic gains in the national elections, Republicans control the governorship and legislatures in 23 states. That helps explain why, in recent months, North Dakota, Alabama, Kansas and Virginia have approved stringent abortion restrictions.\n\nKansas legislators approved a bill that says life begins at fertilization and would prevent abortion providers from claiming tax breaks and prohibit abortions based on sex selection. North Dakota banned abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.\n\nIn Arkansas, where Republican legislators overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe, abortions have been restricted after the 11th week.\n\nSome new rules and regulations have been justified as necessary to protect the health of pregnant women and unborn children. Alabama and Mississippi, for example, have required doctors who do abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital; Virginia has required abortion clinics doing surgery to comply with standards for outpatient surgery centers.\n\nAbortion rights advocates, such as Planned Parenthood, say some of these measures are designed primarily to drive up clinics' costs and put them out of business.\n\nWill the Gosnell case accelerate this trend?\n\nFerrero of Planned Parenthood says more state laws wouldn't have stopped Gosnell; Pennsylvania had ones that were not enforced. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, says many of the new and proposed state laws will drive out legitimate abortion providers: \"The more restrictions we impose, the more we keep monsters like Gosnell in business.\"\n\nHer point may be illustrated by the story of Karnamaya Mongar, who was 41 and 16 weeks pregnant when she came to Gosnell's clinic in 2009.\n\nMongar had reasons for ending the pregnancy. She was poor, spoke no English, and, after spending 20 years in a Nepalese refugee camp, had been in the USA for less than a year. She already had three children; with a fourth, there was no way she could hold a job. \"She said, 'We're just getting started here,' \" her daughter, Yashoda Gurung, testified last week in the trial.\n\nAbortion is legal up to 24 weeks (the first two-thirds) of pregnancy in many states, but Mongar found that actually getting one can be difficult.\n\nA clinic near her home in Woodbridge, Va., said it did not perform abortions after 14 weeks. That clinic directed her to one in Fredericksburg, Va., which also refused her and suggested a clinic in Washington, which in turn referred her to Gosnell's in west Philadelphia.\n\nShe arrived Nov. 19, had the abortion and went into a coma after an unlicensed staffer gave her a dose of Demerol, apparently without knowing her weight; the clinic scale was broken, according to trial witnesses. She died the next day at a hospital.\n\nA relative of Mongar's, Damber Ghalley, testified that when he approached Gosnell to complain, \"he said, 'I didn't do anything wrong. I'll be able to answer any question anywhere.'\"\n\nThe Gosnell case — U.S. Rep Chris Smith, R-N.J., calls it \"the trial of the century\" — has injected emotion into a debate that couldn't seem to get any more emotional.\n\nLydia Saad of the Gallup Organization, who has followed public opinion on abortion for decades, is skeptical it will have a lasting effect.\n\n\"These things tend to fade, like the reaction to the abortion clinic bombings in the past,\" Saad says. \"This is just one extreme case. I think it will be hard to base too much on it.\"\n\n'HOUSE OF HORRORS'\n\nGosnell's clinic was in a three-story brick building at 3801 Lancaster Ave. in west Philadelphia. It was named, without irony, the Women's Medical Society. District Attorney Seth Williams has called it \"a house of horrors,\" and his office's case was presented over five weeks in Courtroom 304 of the courthouse across from City Hall.\n\nWitnesses described an institution where employees, many with personal or financial problems that left them few options, were paid meager wages off the books to perform tasks for which they were unlicensed and untrained, such as taking ultrasounds, administering anesthetics and other prescription drugs orally or intravenously, and assisting in abortions.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to standardize staffers' tasks, Gosnell had them administer uniform dosages of painkilling medication and other drugs, according to one who testified, Latosha Lewis. Some patients, given inappropriately high doses of labor-inducing drugs, abruptly aborted and expelled their fetuses in toilets or on floors.\n\nTestimony from Lewis and others indicated that Gosnell performed many illegal third-trimester abortions but always noted in the patient file the same at-the-legal-limit gestation period — 24.5 weeks.\n\nClinic workers described equipment that was filthy, broken or outmoded. Plastic instruments were reused. Fetal remains were stored in freezer bags, water jugs and pet food containers. Floors were stained with everything from patients' dried blood to feces from cats that wandered freely. When members of a grand jury visited the premises, they wore hazmat suits.\n\nIn February 2010, a state-federal task force — on Gosnell's trail for alleged prescription drug sales, not abortions — raided the clinic. It had been 17 years since a state health inspection. \"Over the years, many people came to know that something was going on,\" said Williams, the DA, \"but no one put a stop to it.\"\n\nWhy not? A grand jury report offered this explanation: \"because the women in question were poor and of color, because the victims were infants without identities, and because the subject was the political football of abortion.\"\n\nJack McMahon, Gosnell's lawyer, says his African-American client is the victim of a \"prosecutorial lynching\" and argues that he treated women even if they couldn't pay up front or in full. \"This black man,\" he said in his opening statement last month, was charged \"because of who he is, and where he works.\"\n\nCOURTROOM 304\n\nAt 72, Gosnell is tall, freckled, graying and balding. Last week, he sat calmly in court, suit coat buttoned, a copy of the textbook Knight's Forensic Pathology at hand. He whispered in the ear of his lawyer and took notes on a yellow legal pad.\n\nOccasionally, he gazed out benignly at those in the courtroom, including reporters. His stately demeanor offered no hint that he could face the death penalty. His appearance — dark suit, light blue shirt, perfectly knotted floral print tie — seemed the antithesis of the chaotic, rundown clinic described by witnesses, and his demeanor betrayed no hint that he faced seven charges of first-degree murder (the babies) and one of third-degree murder (Mongar).\n\nHis photo sat atop a crime family-style organizational chart on the wall in front of the courtroom. Clinic staffers' photos were arrayed in rows beneath his, like so many mob capos and soldiers.\n\nIn the well of the court, the prosecution had assembled equipment from his clinic, including a defibrillator that didn't work and a recovery chair whose side was streaked with blood.\n\nProsecutor Edward Cameron noted that the clinic's files often were stained with bodily fluids. As he passed around a patient file folder, he urged a court clerk to put on gloves before handling it. \"It has some sort of dried red substance on it,\" Cameron warned. \"It stinks.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/22"}]}

Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Chris Jacobs of New York voted for the bill.\n\nWhile the legislation is not expected to amass the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, many Democrats in the House cited a string of recent mass shootings involving such firearms as a pressing reason to outlaw them.\n\n“Today, our Democratic Majority will take up and pass the Assault Weapons Ban legislation: a crucial step in our ongoing fight against the deadly epidemic of gun violence in our nation,” Pelosi said in a letter to members of her caucus ahead of the vote.\n\nFriday’s vote came as progressives, moderates and members of the Congressional Black Caucus are divided on how to handle the policing funding component of a broader public safety package, which was not included in Friday’s series of votes. While negotiations on that proposal are continuing, according to sources, the key negotiators were hoping to settle both issues in hopes of having a vote on both packages as soon as Friday.\n\nModerate and vulnerable Democrats had been pushing for a vote on the policing legislation before they leave town in an effort to rebut GOP attacks over defunding the police, but members of the CBC had concerns and have been pushing for accountability language.\n\nThe deal to try to combine both pieces of legislation came together late Thursday night, and was negotiated between Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty of Ohio, and moderate Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. But other members of the Congressional Black and Progressive caucuses were frustrated that they were kept out of the loop, which is ultimately why Democratic leadership decided to separate the bills.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus held a meeting Friday morning and sources say many were frustrated to not be given equal negotiating power.\n\n“This was supposed to happen in several weeks to give time for us to negotiate stronger police accountability measures,” a staffer of a CBC member told CNN. “Then they sprung this deal on us in the dead of night without any hearings, committee or time for members to read the text much less debate.”\n\nWhen asked about the disagreement by CNN, Beatty denied there was problems within her caucus.\n\n“There is no disappointment with the Congressional Black Caucus,” she said. “We have a big tent. And what I am most proud of, is that we were able to go today and take a leadership role. Look at where we were 48 hours ago.”\n\nShe added: “There was no failure here.”\n\nThe House is slated to depart Washington for a month-long recess starting Friday evening. Pelosi could call lawmakers back into town before September for specific circumstances, something she would likely do if Senate Democrats pass a separate bill on climate change and prescription drug pricing in the coming weeks.\n\nHouse Democrats held a procedural vote open for more than an hour on Friday while Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus members, Gottheimer and others huddled on the House floor to negotiate. Ultimately, the news broke during the vote that leadership was splitting the package.\n\nThe US previously had an assault-style weapons ban first implemented in 1994, which expired in 2004.\n\nEarlier this year, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to address gun violence that amounted to the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades. The legislation included millions of dollars for mental health, school safety, crisis intervention programs and incentives for states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It also made significant changes to the process when someone ages 18 to 21 goes to buy a firearm and closes the so-called boyfriend loophole, a victory for Democrats, who have long fought for that.\n\nShooting survivors and victims' family members release emotional video demanding gun industry accountability 04:03 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a hearing Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee, CEOs from two major gun manufacturers faced questions from lawmakers about their sales of AR-15-style weapons, which have been used in many of the nation’s deadliest mass shootings.\n\n“This is an ultra-deadly weapon, engineered to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield,” said the committee chairwoman, Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York. “Yet the gun industry has flooded our neighborhoods, our schools, and even our churches and synagogues with these deadly weapons and has gotten rich doing it.”\n\nThe committee also released the finding of their investigation, which alleges gun manufactures selling assault-style rifles have employed questionable marketing tactics, including appealing to White supremacists, “preying” on the masculinity of young men, and running advertisements that mimic video games.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.", "authors": ["Daniella Diaz Annie Grayer Eva Mckend", "Daniella Diaz", "Annie Grayer", "Eva Mckend"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/state/2022/12/12/illinois-house-committee-to-hear-testimony-on-assault-weapons-ban/69710128007/", "title": "Illinois House committee to hear testimony on assault weapons ban", "text": "Illinois lawmakers are considering legislation that would ban the sale and ownership of assault-style weapons —joining states such as California and New York that have enacted similar bans.\n\nFirst introduced during the final week of the veto session by House firearm safety and reform working group chairman Rep.

The proposal comes as firearm homicides increased by 35% from 2019 to 2020 nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOn Monday, the bill will be heard during a House judiciary criminal committee meeting. Hundreds of supporters and opponents have signed up for the meeting scheduled for 11 a.m. in Chicago.\n\nMorgan's legislation lists more than 100 weapons that would be banned, including the AR-15 rifle which was used to kill seven people and injure 48 others during a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park. The bill also increases the age for most Illinoisans to carry a firearm from 18 to 21.\n\n“Gun violence is destroying families and communities from East St. Louis to Highland Park to Chicago, and this moment demands urgency,” said Morgan, who was walking in the Highland Park Parade when the shooting began. “It is time that we had the political courage to admit that guns are a problem and that we can do something about it.

Republican lawmakers in recent years, including former gubernatorial candidate and Sen. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, have filed legislation that would end the FOID program.\n\nBailey's bill from 2021 never made it out of committee, but some have advocated for change within the program. Following the Highland Park shooting, it was revealed that 21-year-old suspect Robert Crimo III had a FOID card despite threatening to \"kill everyone\" at a family incident two years prior.\n\nLaw enforcement said this was possible since his family did not raise concerns once the then 19-year-old Crimo applied for a FOID card. His father sponsored his application.\n\nIs it constitutional?\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022 in a 217-213 vote. It has yet to receive any voting action in the U.S. Senate but has been targeted by national gun rights organizations for its constitutionality.\n\nIn Illinois, the Illinois State Rifle Association — a nearly 120-year-old organization that advocates for gun rights — has already declared that it will seek legal action if HB 5855 becomes law.\n\nMore General Assembly:Beyond the SAFE-T Act: These bills passed during the Illinois General Assembly veto session\n\n\"So, are you angry? Good, so are we,\" ISRA said on its website, deriding Pritzker as the \"most anti-gun Governor this state has ever seen. As law-abiding citizens, the time is now to take a stand for our constitutionally protected rights. It is time to use our 1st amendment rights to protect our 2nd amendment rights.\"\n\nOther groups such as the Gun Violence Prevention PAC have come out in favor of the bill, saying the more than 50 mass shootings in the state in 2022 alone requires the General Assembly to act swiftly.\n\n“It is our duty to protect those most affected by this man-made epidemic,” said Kathleen Sances, G-PAC president and chief executive officer. “Too many lives are on the line, and we simply cannot wait for these overdue policies to be passed and signed into law this summer — a time of year we know gun violence tends to spike in Illinois.\"\n\nRecent polling from Global Strategy Group also indicates support among registered Illinois voters for several provisions of the bill. An estimated 58% of those surveyed said they would support an assault-style weapons ban in the state, while 66% said they wanted the minimum age to obtain a FOID card raised from 18 to 21.\n\nContact Patrick Keck: pkeck@gannett.com, twitter.com/@pkeckreporter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/04/26/washington-bans-assault-rifles-weapons-list-of-states/11741980002/", "title": "Washington state joins others in banning sales of \"assault weapons\"", "text": "Washington is now the ninth state to ban sales of a wide swath of mostly semi-automatic weapons including AR-15s and other firearms that have become symbols over their use in mass shootings.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed House Bill 1240 into law, a measure prohibiting \"manufacture, importation, distribution, selling, and offering for sale\" of more than 60 specific weapons, including AR-15s, M-16s, AK-47s and others\n\nIllinois decision: Judge blocks enforcement of weapons ban on constitutional grounds.\n\nThe law, one of three signed Tuesday, focuses on guns that state legislators describe as \"assault weapons.\" It also bans kits that can convert a semi-automatic firearm into an automatic one. The law takes effect immediately.\n\nA second measure requires a 10-day waiting period and safety training for all other firearm purchases. It takes effect Jan. 1, 2024. The third bill increases liability for gunmakers and dealers and takes effect July 23.\n\nWhich states now ban these weapons?\n\nTen states now ban guns classified by lawmakers as \"assault weapons.\" Nine states include rifles in their bans. A 10th state, Hawaii, bans such pistols but not rifles. Virginia and Minnesota regulate the firearms but do not ban them.\n\nIn Illinois, a federal judge blocked enforcement of that state's weapons ban on Friday. In a 29-page opinion, Judge Stephen P. McGlynn, of the Southern District of Illinois said the ban was likely to be found unconstitutional. The decision could be appealed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWashington's new bill does not ban ownership of the weapons for law enforcement and those in the military. Gun manufacturers can sell existing inventory to buyers outside Washington for 90 days after the bill becomes law.\n\nLegal challenges have already been filed in federal courts.\n\nHow the weapons are defined\n\nLawmakers, researchers and activists often define \"assault weapons\" as military-style semi-automatic firearms designed to enact great devastation quickly. Some groups contend that guns must be automatic to be labeled \"assault weapons.\"\n\nThe Atlantic traces the origin of the term to Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The term is vague, jurisdictions may define the term differently, and some prefer \"assault-style\" weapons.\n\nUnder the National Firearms Act, automatic firearms are restricted in the United States to the military, law enforcement and civilians who have obtained special licenses to own such weapons (provided the weapons were manufactured before May 19, 1986).\n\nAccording to The Associated Press:\n\nSemi-automatic rifle: \"A rifle that fires one bullet each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically reloads for a subsequent shot.\"\n\nAutomatic rifle: A rifle that \"continuously fires rounds if the trigger is depressed and until its ammunition is exhausted.\"\n\n\"Assault rifles\" and \"assault weapons\": \"Highly politicized terms that generally refer to AR- or AK-style rifles designed for the civilian market.\"\n\nHow firearm background checks have shifted\n\nThe number of gun owners in the U.S. isn't known. Background checks on gun buyers, though limited, give some idea of interest in gun purchases.\n\nFederal law requires that people who buy guns from a federal firearms licensed dealer go through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The checks verify buyers do not have a criminal records or are ineligible to buy a firearm. Unlicensed sellers can transfer firearms without conducting checks.\n\nGun rights advocates, including the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation, responded with federal lawsuits challenging Washington's ban, saying it infringes on Second Amendment rights.\n\nAn Assault Weapons Ban Act passed the U.S. House last summer but has since stalled in the Senate. The act defines a “semi-automatic assault weapon” by listing numerous combinations of prohibited devices, parts, components, devices, attachments and accessories, and it explicitly prohibits dozens of AK- and AR-type rifles, among dozens of others of specifically named firearms.\n\n______________\n\nCONTRIBUTING Shawn Sullivan, Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; The Associated Press; Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence; FBI", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/gun-laws-us-congress/index.html", "title": "Gun laws in the US: Why Congress won't act on legislation anytime ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTuesday’s shooting at a Texas elementary school, which has left at least 19 children and two adults dead, marked another instance of a uniquely American tragedy.\n\nThe shooting is the latest entry in the long history of gun violence in the United States. Before Tuesday, there had been at least 39 shootings in K-12 schools, colleges and universities in 2022, resulting in at least 10 deaths and 51 injuries.\n\nWhile proposals to overhaul gun laws – such a ban on assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines – face steep odds at the federal level, there are some areas of bipartisan agreement. Whether that’s enough to break congressional gridlock is yet to be seen.\n\nHere’s what to know about what is being considered in Congress and where it stands.\n\nClosing loopholes\n\nA House-passed bill, HR 1446, backed by Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, would close what’s known as the “Charleston loophole,” which allows some licensed gun sales to go through before a required background check is done.\n\nSpecifically, the legislation would increase the amount of time, from three business days to a minimum of 10 business days, that a federal firearms licensee must wait to receive a completed background check prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person.\n\nUsing that loophole, a White gunman was able to legally purchase a firearm to kill nine people at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nSenate Democrats took steps Tuesday night to place the bill, called the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, onto the legislative calendar so it can be voted on.\n\nIt’s unclear when the Senate will vote on the measure, but it needs 60 votes in the chamber to overcome a filibuster, and it’s clear the legislation does not have that support (at least not right now) – nor does it have full Democratic backing to gut the Senate rule altogether.\n\nIt’s unclear when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will try to force a procedural vote to break a filibuster. Unless there’s an agreement from all 100 senators, the earliest he could set up the procedural vote would be Saturday, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nBut senators were expected to leave for next week’s Memorial Day recess on Thursday afternoon. So they may wait until after the recess to take that procedural vote, even though leaving town amid the Texas tragedy would be bad optics.\n\nThe aide said Schumer has not indicated when he may try to force the vote yet.\n\nStill, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who has pushed for gun safety legislation since the Sandy Hook shooting in his state nearly 10 years ago, told reporters Tuesday there should be a vote even if it is doomed to fail.\n\n“I think we need to hold every member of Congress accountable and vote so that the public knows where every one of us stand,” he said. Asked about the potential for bipartisan agreement, he added, “I think there may well be areas of agreement. I have come close to agreement with a number of my colleagues on a red flag statute.”\n\n‘Red flag’ legislation\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Wednesday he’ll put a gun safety bill known as the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to a vote in the House during the first week of June.\n\n“Congress must do more to #EndGunViolence. During the first week of the June work period, I will bring @RepLucyMcBath’s bill to the Floor to establish a national ‘Red Flag’ law to prevent those who pose a threat to themselves or others from being able to legally possess a firearm,” he tweeted.\n\nThe legislation, which is sponsored by Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who lost her son to a shooting a decade ago, would “allow family members and law enforcement to obtain an extreme risk protection order to temporarily remove access to firearms for those who are deemed a danger to themselves or to others by a federal court.”\n\nRed flag laws tend to be supported by those favoring more gun safety measures, arguing that the policies can prohibit mass shootings from happening in the first place.\n\nBut critics say they infringe on due process by letting a judge make an initial decision – even if temporary – without hearing from the accused, and by allowing the judge to curtail someone’s Second Amendment right to bear arms without the respondent ever having been convicted of a crime or been adjudged mentally ill.\n\nWhile the legislation will likely find support in the House, it would face steep odds in the Senate.\n\nEven bills with bipartisan support can’t pass the Senate\n\nAnother bill, HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers.\n\nThe legislation has bipartisan support, passing the House last year in a 227-203 vote. Eight Republicans supported the bill and one Democrat voted against it.\n\nAsked Tuesday about this broader House-passed background checks measure, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia referenced his own, narrower effort in the Senate, saying, “If you can’t pass Manchin-Toomey, how are you going to get enough votes for anything?”\n\nIn 2013, Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania pushed a compromise bill that would have required background checks on all commercial sales of guns (including private sales at gun shows and all internet sales), but would have allowed for individuals to sell their firearms to family, friends and other acquaintances without background checks.\n\nThis failed under Senate filibuster rules, even though it had majority support. The vote was 54-46, with four Republicans joining most Democrats in support. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cast a “no” vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again. Four other Democrats voted against the bill.\n\nManchin has continued to push versions of that legislation in more recent years.\n\nRepublicans will argue that background checks chip away at gun rights and, ultimately, will take away guns. “You see Democrats and a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe GOP will also argue that the bills would not stop every shooting. This is true. The specifics of each shooting are different. We still don’t know if any of this legislation would have stopped Tuesday’s shooter, identified by Texas officials as Salvador Ramos.\n\nFor now, every state has variations on the rules. Most action on gun regulation is happening at the state level because Washington is frozen on the issue, as it is on so many others.\n\nThe filibuster, again\n\nDemocrats argue that this intransigence means Senate rules must change. There are a lot of subjects on which Republicans will block Democrats – limiting gun rights, expanding voting rights, addressing climate change, rolling back tax cuts and more. Calls to end the filibuster will continue to grow.\n\nUntil every Democrat agrees, it’s not possible to end the filibuster. Manchin supports gun control measures like the one he sponsored. But he’s more committed to maintaining Senate rules, which currently require 60 votes to move forward on legislation.\n\n“The filibuster is the only thing that prevents us from total insanity,” Manchin said Tuesday.\n\nOther Democrats, such as Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, also support maintaining the filibuster. It would require a simple majority to create a new precedent under Senate rules.\n\nNotably, after Sinema tweeted that she was “horrified and heartbroken” by Tuesday’s shooting, Rep. Ruben Gallego, a likely primary challenger in 2024, criticized her for supporting the filibuster. “Please just stop.. unless you are willing to break the filibuster to actually pass sensible gun control measures you might as well just say ‘thoughts and prayers,’” he tweeted.\n\nBut for now, either Democrats must all agree to end the filibuster or Republicans must begin to support gun control measures in larger numbers. Until then, there will be no new federal gun laws.\n\nBiden calls for lawmakers to have a backbone\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the shooting in emotional remarks from the White House Tuesday evening, saying, “I had hoped when I became President, I would not have to do this again.”\n\nTurning to the issue of gun control legislation, Biden implored lawmakers to “turn this pain into action” as he ticked through some of the mass shootings since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook, when he was vice president.\n\n“Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God’s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with and stand up to the lobbies?” he said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said in remarks earlier Tuesday that “enough is enough.”\n\n“Our hearts keep getting broken. … Every time a tragedy like this happens, our hearts break and our broken hearts are nothing compared to the broken hearts of those families. And, yet, it keeps happening,” she said.\n\nStill, familiar political postures emerged throughout the day.\n\nGOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned Democrats against having a “reflexive reaction,” saying he is confident in the coming days it will be learned that there were “signs” the 18-year-old shooter was “at risk.”\n\n“It’s horrible. And you know what we need to avoid is the reflexive reaction we have to say this could all be solved by not having guns in anyone’s hands. We can always talk about reasonable measures, but we also have to talk about better situational awareness,” Tillis told CNN.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/01/10/illinois-senate-passes-own-version-of-assault-style-weapons-ban/69792699007/", "title": "Illinois Senate passes own version of assault-style weapons ban", "text": "The Illinois Senate on Monday passed an amended version of the assault-style weapons ban. The Protect Illinois Communities Act now heads to the Illinois House of Representatives for a concurrence vote Tuesday.\n\nThe matter was discussed on the Senate floor in a relatively short debate with several Republicans rising in opposition to House Bill 5471. The final tally at 6:15 p.m. was 34-20 with four Democrats, including state Sen. Doris Turner of Springfield, voting against it.\n\nSenate President Don Harmon introduced five amendments to PICA filed under HB 5471. Harmon detailed what they would entail on the Senate floor Monday evening.\n\nThe bill would prevent the sale, manufacture, possession and purchase of assault-style weapons, assault weapon attachments, and .50 caliber cartridges in the state of Illinois. It would also keep standards set in earlier versions of the act, such as maintaining the age to get a Firearm Owner Identification Card at 18.\n\nWhat it did change were rounds per magazine limits. Long guns will have a limit of 10 rounds per magazine and handguns will not be allowed to have more than 15 rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe restraining order for those wishing to purchase a firearm but who have been found to be a \"significant danger of causing personal injury to himself,\" per the bill, was also increased to a maximum of 12 months from six months.\n\nGun safety and violence prevention advocacy groups were quick to release statements of support following the Senate vote on Monday. Harmon thanked those groups for their backing, but noted that more needed to be done to prevent gun violence in the state.\n\n\"This will not solve the problem, but it is absolutely a step in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nSenate Republicans, as expected, in opposition\n\nThe House vote on Senate Bill 2226, the second version of PICA after House Bill 5855 was introduced in December, secured the exiting House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, R-Western Springs, as its sole Republican supporter. No Senate Republican backed HB 5471 on Monday.\n\nMore:Illinois House passes assault-style weapons ban; bill now heads to Senate\n\nState Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, argued that pieces of legislation that could mitigate gun violence already are on books. Reading from a lengthy list of laws, he said the bill before the Senate would not be a solution but rather target law-abiding citizens.\n\n\"Enforce the laws that already exist,\" he said. \"We're going to make felons out of taxpayers. Put the bad guys behind the bars, not the good guys.\"\n\nFormer gubernatorial candidate and state Sen. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, and state Sen. Neil Anderson, R-Moline, said the bill was an affront to the Second Amendment. Bailey, specifically, said he expects the Illinois Supreme Court will find the measure unconstitutional.\n\n\"You've got to know the actions that you are taking are tyrannous,\" he said to the Senators favoring the bill. \"You also must know that I and millions of other gun owners in this state will not comply.\"\n\nAnderson, after asking Harmon the definition of a \"weapon of war,\" contended that the bill does not include several weapons that fit the definition. Weapons such as the M1 Garand rifle and the 1911 handgun are not listed in the bill, he said, despite being used by those in the armed forces.\n\n\"The hypocrisy that we are trying to ban so-called 'weapons of war,' but yet the weapons of war that you actually speak of are not weapons of war,\" he said, adding later than those voting in favor of the bill should resign.\n\nHarmon said those weapons were not included because of the number of rounds they held — the M1 Garand having an 8-round clip and the 1911 pistol having a seven-round magazine.\n\n\"The weapons on this list are designed to do one thing and one thing only: kill people in a horribly brutal, vicious way,\" he said.\n\nAs for an expected legal battle, which gun rights organizations have already promised if signed into law, Harmon seemed to welcome it. He added in his final remark of the evening that \"we will see you in court.\"\n\nUnited once again\n\nSoon after Harmon's amendments were filed on Sunday, Gov. JB Pritzker and Speaker of the House Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch indicated they would not be supporting a watered-down version of the bill originally passed by the House.\n\nIt marked what some called a public divide among party leadership, but one that appeared bridged on Monday. The Senate president noted early in the floor debate he agreed \"entirely\" with the needed changes to the earlier introduced amendments.\n\nThe trio released a joint statement following the Senate vote, saying they expected the House to pass the bill on Tuesday.\n\n“Gun violence is an epidemic that is plaguing every corner of this state and the people of Illinois are demanding substantive action,\" the joint statement reads. \"With this legislation we are delivering on the promises Democrats have made and, together, we are making Illinois’ gun laws a model for the nation.”\n\nHeading to the governor's desk?\n\nWhile the measure still requires a concurrence vote in the House, Pritzker is expected to sign the bill if it arrives on his desk. The Democratic governor has long-signaled support for an assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazine ban.\n\nUnlike the Thursday debate, spilling into a Friday SB 2226 vote, the governor was not in attendance for the Senate's Monday night vote. He was at the inauguration event being held at the Exposition Building of the Illinois State Fairgrounds.\n\nPritzker discussed the need to pass the assault-style weapons ban during his inauguration address at the Bank of Springfield Center. He also called on a federal ban to follow suit, which he had previously done in a July White House ceremony with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering.\n\n\"Hospitals, high schools, homes, parades, offices – there is no place, geographic or otherwise, that has been spared from the threat of gun violence,\" Pritzker said after being sworn-in for another four-year term. \"Whether it’s ghost guns, high-powered semi-automatic rifles, or modified rapid-fire handguns, dangerous weapons are putting families and law enforcement at risk.\"\n\nTuesday is the last scheduled day of the lame duck session and the 102nd Illinois General Assembly.

In fact, many of the large gun groups consider \"assault weapon\" a made up and ambiguous term invented by the anti-gun lobby in the 1980s, maintaining that guns don't actually \"assault\" people.\n\nThat said, the gun industry's traditional definition of an \"assault rifle\" is a weapon the military generally uses and has \"select fire capabilities,\" or the capability to switch between semi-automatic or a fully automatic mode. However, the civilian AR-15s do not have the select fire capabilities, only semi-automatic settings, so the firearms industry insists they are not an actual assault rifle or assault weapon.\n\nMore:Dick's Sporting Goods bans sales of assault-style weapons after Parkland, Florida school shooting\n\nMore:Sales of bulletproof doors and windows boom as Parkland students return to school\n\nMore:Other states welcome Delta after Georgia tax dispute with NRA\n\nMore:Florida House to vote on bill that would put armed teachers in classrooms\n\nTo be clear, though, the federal government usually refers to a military-style weapon capable of firing multiple rounds, either semi-automatic or a fully automatic firearm.\n\nRegardless, the controversy over the AR-15-style rifle stems from its widespread use in some of the nation's worst mass shootings.\n\nThe AR-15 weapon used by accused shooter Nikolas Cruz at a high school in Parkland, Fla., is a semi-automatic version of the U.S. military's M-16 rifle and was included in a 10-year ban signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. That law also banned the semi-automatic weapons used in other mass shootings, including the Oct. 1 massacre in Las Vegas and the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, points out on its website that the \"AR\" actually doesn't stand for assault rifle or automatic rifle but dates back to the 1950s and refers to the company that developed the weapon system, Armalite Rifle.\n\n\"AR-15-style rifles are NOT 'assault weapons' or 'assault rifles,' according to NSSF's website. \"An assault rifle is fully automatic — a machine gun. Automatic firearms have been severely restricted from civilian ownership since 1934.\"\n\nThe NSSF added, \"AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles, such as the M-16, but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger.\"\n\nStates also tend to have different definitions in gun laws for what is an assault weapon or assault rifle, and it often changes when lawmakers seek to close what they perceive as loopholes.\n\nFor one, California's gun laws changed this year so that certain AR-15 rifles with so-called bullet buttons are no longer exempt from an earlier assault weapons ban and now must be modified. Lawful owners, though, are allowed to keep the weapon if they register it.\n\nThere is also proposed legislation in Ohio that would limit the AR-15. The state's Republican governor, John Kasich, said Sunday he wanted a way to curb sales of the \"God-darn AR-15\" but the bill also could impact the sale statewide of all semi-automatic weapons.\n\nThe National Rifle Association declined requests for an interview but, on its website, it defends the AR-15s as \"the most commonly used rifles in marksmanship competitions, training and home defense.\" It also said more than 15 million AR-15s are owned by Americans today.\n\nThe Ohio bill defines an assault weapon as \"an automatic firearm that has not been rendered permanently inoperable, a semi-automatic firearm capable of accepting a detachable magazine with the capacity to accept ten or more cartridges, and a semi-automatic firearm with a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept ten or more cartridges.\"\n\nAt the same time, there's more pressure on lawmakers in Florida to pass gun legislation. Earlier attempts after the 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando failed.\n\nThe 1994 federal assault weapons ban, officially known as the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was passed as a crime-fighting bill and identified more than a dozen specific models of firearms, including the Colt AR-15, that were defined as semi-automatic assault weapons. It also defined the term by specific characteristics, such as the ability to accept a detachable magazine and by certain cosmetic features.\n\nEven so, the 1994 ban also excluded semi-automatic rifles that couldn't accept a detachable magazine holding more than five rounds of ammunition as well as around 650 guns that were considered primarily used in hunting and recreational sports, including Browning, Remington and Berettas.\n\nAfter the deadly Newtown shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, there was a attempt to pass another assault weapons ban by Democrats but it failed. The 2013 gun legislation would have banned nearly 160 specific firearms and further defined what constituted a \"semi-automatic assault weapon.\" Moreover, it also would have banned parts or devices to the firearms that accelerated the rate of semi-automatic rifle fire.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the top Democratic negotiator.\n\nOther Democrats are trying to capitalize on momentum even if they don’t think a deal will solve the problem of gun violence.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had kind words for the “rational Republicans” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, noting “there’s a recognition on their part they can’t continue like this.”\n\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on CNN on Sunday he senses “a different feeling among my colleagues after Uvalde.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has given a bipartisan group of lawmakers a week to make some headway. The negotiators include Cornyn, who has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, and Murphy, who has become an outspoken supporter of gun laws since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in his state. Talks were held virtually on Tuesday.\n\nWhat Democrats want\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee plans to vote as soon as Thursday on wide-ranging gun control legislation, known as the “Protecting Our Kids Act.” While it would likely pass the Democratic-controlled House, it’s unlikely to pass the Senate.\n\nDemocrats’ preference is to raise the age limit to 21 to buy certain guns and reinstate the federal assault weapons ban that lapsed in 2004. But they will have to accept something much less if they want to get anything done. It takes a supermajority of 60 to pass major legislation through the 100-member Senate.\n\nWhat Republicans are saying\n\nMcConnell signaled his vision for compromise gun legislation during an appearance in Kentucky on Tuesday when he described the bipartisan talks without using the word “gun.”\n\nRather, in McConnell’s view, negotiators will be “discussing how we might be able to come together to target the problem, which is mental illness and school safety.”\n\nTakeaway: McConnell does not think the problem is guns.\n\nThe Trump side of things\n\nAt the NRA’s annual convention in Houston over the weekend, former President Donald Trump – who still holds sway in the party and particularly among base Republican voters – said there should be more guns in schools.\n\n“The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” Trump said in his speech.\n\nTurning schools into fortresses is what Trump and some of his fellow Republicans are endorsing.\n\nFrom CNN’s report: Trump in his speech called for a series of measures that largely mirrored what other Republicans had proposed throughout the day: Schools with a single entryway, with armed guards stationed there, and exit-only fire escapes. He also said some teachers should be allowed to carry firearms.\n\nWhat are some sensible gun restrictions?\n\nEven some NRA members can see the need for some new gun restrictions, according to CNN’s Eric Bradner and Jeff Zeleny, who reported from the convention.\n\nThey wrote: Max Shirley, an NRA member from Round Rock, Texas, said he would support “sensible measures” to stop the cycle of school shootings. He said he believed the age limit to buy an automatic weapon should be raised to 21 and the clip size for ammunition should be lowered.\n\n“If the person you’re defending yourself against is not down or the threat is not diminished after 10 rounds or 10 shots, then you’ve got bigger problems,” Shirley told CNN. “Or you’re a bad shot.”\n\nWhat’s on the table?\n\nThose kinds of restrictions that Shirley would accept don’t even appear to be on the table in Washington.\n\nCornyn told reporters in Texas on Monday that he would be focused on mental health and potentially red flag laws already enacted in some states to allow authorities to seize guns from people in crisis.\n\n“I mentioned access to mental health treatment and diagnosis is absolutely critical,” he said.\n\nCornyn focused on the need to make background checks part of the national conversation and other possible “limitations under federal law of what sort of firearms you can buy and own and maintain, if you have a criminal or mental health record. And we’ll be looking at all of that.”\n\nHe was among the majority of Republicans that opposed a bipartisan proposal to update background checks after Sandy Hook.\n\nUnderstanding opposition to all new gun regulations\n\nThe most instructive thing I saw on the gun debate over the weekend was the interview that CNN’s Dana Bash had with Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, on “State of the Union.”\n\nHe explained, in the clearest way, why he opposes any new gun restrictions, even after the massacre at the elementary school in his state. Watch the interview here.\n\nWhy he opposes red flag laws at the national level\n\nCrenshaw: “I think there’s a lot of problems with red flag laws, especially at a national level. When it comes to criminal law, that really should be democratically decided at the local and state level, but, even so, you have to look at these and wonder what the actual purpose is.”\n\nWhy he opposes red flag laws in Texas\n\nCrenshaw: “What we are essentially trying to do with a red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And that’s a really difficult thing to do. It’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat.\n\nNow, if they’re such a threat they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they have already broken the law, so why do you need this other law?”\n\nWhat’s wrong with universal background checks?\n\nCrenshaw: “People have to understand what universal background checks mean. That means that I can no longer sell a gun to my friend. If my neighbor, let’s say her husband is gone for the week and she wants to borrow my gun, that would make us both felons.\n\nThat’s the problem with universal background checks. And the people who are least likely to adhere to universal background checks are the criminals who intend harm. So, again, it’s an outcome problem. I don’t think they would have the outcome people think they would have.”\n\nWhat’s wrong with restricting sales of certain guns to people under 21?\n\nCrenshaw: “Well, look, I’m not very impressed by our current swathe of 18-year-olds and their maturity level, so maybe we should have that conversation. But then it has to apply broadly. It has to mean that you’re not an adult until 21.\n\nAnd then what happens then? When we see a 22-year-old commit an atrocity, are we going to raise it again, and are we going to raise it again?”\n\nBut the human brain isn’t completely developed at 18\n\nBash noted that the National Institutes of Health has said that a person’s brain isn’t finished developing until the mid-20s.\n\nCrenshaw: “Yes, that’s true. That’s true. And does that mean that we – I think it’s 26, actually. So, does that mean you’re not an adult until 26?\n\nI think I was on my second deployment by then. So it’s – these are hard questions.” (Crenshaw served in the military.)\n\nWhat would he support?\n\nCrenshaw: “I think what needs to change is the things that would have the most immediate and succinct effect and tangible effect on these things. And that’s actual security at a school. So, it’s not as if Republicans have never proposed anything.”\n\nThere are more guns than people in this country. That’s not a problem?\n\nCrenshaw: “No. I think, culturally, we’re a country that has long had a Second Amendment that believes in the right to self-defense. I don’t think it’s a problem that I own guns.\n\nAnd I know that, if I destroyed all my guns, it would have zero effect on crime. It would have zero effect on gun homicides, because I’m not the person who goes and shoots somebody. I am a person who might protect somebody from being shot.”\n\nDid the framers envision these weapons of war?\n\nBash noted that the Second Amendment calls for a well-regulated militia, and she asked if Crenshaw thinks the founding fathers intended for people to have weapons of war.\n\nCrenshaw: “Let’s talk about the weapons of war thing for a second, because you brought that up. So, having been to war and having used many, many weapons of war, I don’t really classify these rifles as weapons of war.\n\nWe use them, but we use them – they’re more a self-defense weapon. And I would say that if a SEAL team or an infantry team goes on offense, they’re using much, much bigger weapons that are not available to your common civilian.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/politics/california-newsom-gun-bill-texas-abortion-law/index.html", "title": "Gavin Newsom signs California gun bill modeled after Texas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a bill into law that allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nCalifornia Senate Bill 1327 is modeled after a Texas law that allows private citizens to bring civil litigation against abortion providers or anyone who assists a pregnant person in obtaining an abortion after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. The US Supreme Court in December allowed Texas’ six-week abortion ban to remain in effect, which prompted Newsom, who has been supportive of abortion rights and pro-gun control, to say he was “outraged” by the court’s decision and direct his staff to draft a similar bill to regulate guns.\n\nUnder the California law, a person would also be able to sue a licensed firearms dealer who “sells, supplies, delivers, or gives possession or control of a firearm” to anyone under 21 years old. It allows citizens to sue for a minimum of $10,000 on each weapon involved, as well as attorney fees.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, on Friday acknowledged that the law would likely be challenged in court.\n\n“We believe this will be litigated in the Supreme Court and we believe the Supreme Court will be challenged. Because if there’s any principle left whatsoever – and that’s an open ended question – with this Supreme Court, there is no way they can deny us the right to move in this direction,” he said after signing the bill at Santa Monica College, the site of a 2013 shooting spree.\n\nThe law, introduced in February, says that it would become “inoperative upon invalidation” of the Texas abortion law, should the US Supreme Court or Texas Supreme Court strike down that measure. The California law would then be “repealed on January 1 of the following year.”\n\nThe US Supreme Court last month ruled that the Constitution protects the right to carry a gun outside the home, and in striking down a New York gun carry restriction, allowed for all sorts of gun safety laws to be challenged in federal court. The decision will likely impact legal challenges to California’s assault weapons ban, its ban on magazines holding more than 10 rounds and its prohibition on keeping people under the age of 21 from purchasing certain semi-automatic weapons.\n\nCalifornia has passed several gun measures this month aimed at curbing gun violence in the wake of several mass shootings across the nation, including a mass shooting on July 4 in downtown Sacramento and a mass shooting in the same city just three months before.\n\nNewsom last week signed a bill into law that makes it easier for gun violence victims or local governments to sue gun makers if the firearms were used in crimes. And the governor on Thursday signed a slew of gun legislation that would require more regulations on gun sales and dealers within the state, as well as increased information sharing between schools and law enforcement agencies.\n\nWhile the Democratic governor said Friday that there is a “subzero” chance that he runs for the White House in 2024, he has doubled down lately in his challenge of other big state Republican governors, who like him are speculated presidential candidates.\n\nAhead of the legislation signing Friday, he ran a full-page newspaper ad in three Texas newspapers that attacked Texas Gov. Greg Abbott over his position on abortion rights and guns. “If Texas can ban abortion and endanger lives, California can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives,” Newsom said in a statement to CNN. “If Governor Abbott truly wants to protect the right to life, I urge him to follow California’s lead.”\n\nDuring Friday’s signing ceremony, Newsom argued that it’s time to “act differently” in response to rights being “wiped out in real time” by red states. He said he would highlight this legislation for other governors to enact in their states.\n\nBut asked directly about a presidential bid, the governor said Friday: “Subzero, I’ll say it in five languages now. I don’t know how more often I can say it.”\n\n“I can’t take what’s happening in this country, I can’t take the assault on liberty and freedom. I can’t take the rhetoric,” he said, adding, “This is a challenging moment. The Supreme Court has put this responsibility squarely on the doorstep of governors now, and legislative leaders, and local leaders across this country. And we have to meet this moment and we can’t do it with passivity that we’ve seen in the past.”\n\nSenate Bill 1327 has, however, garnered criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union California Action, which warned that the measure would set a “dangerous legal precedent – not only undermining fundamental principles of due process, but eliminating the judiciary as a check and balance against the political branches, effectively unraveling the separation of powers doctrine.”\n\n“There is no way to ‘take advantage of the flawed logic’ of the Texas law,” the ACLU California Action wrote in a letter to the legislative authors of the bill, adding, “Replicating the reprehensible Texas model only serves to legitimize and promote it, as evidenced by the copycat measures already enacted in some states, with many more pending around the country.”", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/20/assault-weapons-house-committee-considers-ban-after-mass-shootings/10095354002/", "title": "Assault weapons: House committee considers ban after mass ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary Committee is expected to consider a bill that would ban assault weapons during a hearing scheduled Wednesday.\n\nThe action follows a series of mass shootings across the country in recent weeks, including mass shootings at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York; an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas; and a Fourth of July parade in Highland, Park, Illinois.\n\nIt also comes on the heels of President Joe Biden signing a bipartisan gun safety bill – the most significant move on guns by Congress in decades – that enhances background checks on gun buyers 18 to 21 years old and encourages states to develop \"red-flag\" laws that deny guns to people deemed to dangerous.\n\nBiden also called for a ban on assault weapons in June, as did some members of Congress.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the bill.\n\nWho are the sponsors?\n\nThe bill was introduced in both chambers as companion legislation by Rep.

He added that \"banning these weapons will make our cities and towns safer and more secure and help to reduce gun deaths.\"\n\n\"We’re now seeing a rise in domestic terrorism, and military-style assault weapons are increasingly becoming the guns of choice for these dangerous groups,\" Feinstein said in a statement last year.\n\nWhat happens if this bill becomes law?\n\nThe bill would forbid the \"sale, import, manufacture or transfer of certain semi-automatic weapons.\" The ban would not include those who already own firearms.\n\nIt would also forbid the transfer of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Background checks would be mandatory to purchase \"any future sale, trade or gifting of an assault weapon covered by the bill.\" It also prohibits magazines and \"other ammunition feeding devices,\" that have over 10 rounds of ammunition, which permit shooters to fire rounds fast without having to reload the gun.\n\nWhat are the exceptions to the bill?\n\nMore than 2,200 guns for hunting, household defense or recreational purposes are listed as exceptions to the bill.

In September 1994, a federal law was enacted to ban assault weapons. At the time, Biden was one of the senators who pushed for the 10-year assault weapon ban.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf the bill passes the committee, House Democrats could take it to the full House, where they would need almost all Democrats to support it.\n\nBiden signs bipartisan gun bill:One month after Uvalde massacre, Biden signs most significant gun control bill in nearly 30 years", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}]}

The sheriff also said a deputy was shot.\n\n“The suspect was located at the residence on 2511 Conway Rd early Wednesday morning. At around 7:10 a.m. the suspect shot from within his location in the home striking Investigator Horn in the lower right leg,” The Leake County Sheriff’s Office posted on their Facebook page. “Horn was transported to Leake Baptist where he was stabilized. The situation continued for roughly two hours before it was resolved.” No further explanation of what that meant was given in the statement.\n\nMultiple law enforcement agencies were searching parts of the state, with at least one county sheriff's department telling residents to “please keep your doors locked and have no keys or weapons in your vehicles” following unconfirmed reports that the man was spotted in the area.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals service and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations are among the agencies assisting in the search.\n\nPolice said Anthony Watts, 61, was shot and killed Monday night around 7 p.m. on Interstate 55 in Jackson after he pulled over to help a man who had wrecked a motorcycle. Police say that man shot Watts several times and then stole his Red Dodge Ram. Watts died at the scene.\n\n“Based on information gathered from investigators, the suspect ... fit the description of 22-year-old Dylan Arrington,” Jackson Police Chief James E. Davis said.\n\nArrington is one of four prisoners — along with Casey Grayson, Corey Harrison and Jerry Raynes — who escaped Saturday night from the Raymond Detention Center, a facility near Jackson, through breaches in a cell and the roof. Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said the men might have camped out on the roof before fleeing the facility and going their separate ways.\n\nThe four were in custody for various felony charges, most involving theft. Arrington had charges of auto theft and illegal possession of a firearm, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nWatts' stolen Red Dodge Ram, which has tan trim and Cowboys stickers on the front and the back, was last seen heading south on I-55 in Terry, Mississippi, police said.\n\nJones said one of the prisoners stole a Hinds County Public Works vehicle that was later recovered in a suburb of Houston. Investigators also believe a stolen Chevy Silverado is connected to the escape. None of the men had been captured as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“Be extra cautious, be vigilant of anything that appears to be suspicious,” Jones said Tuesday. “Make sure you get on the phone” and notify local police.\n\n“No information at this point is too small to provide to law enforcement,” he said.\n\nJail under federal scrutiny\n\nIn July, a federal judge ordered a rare takeover of the jail after he said deficiencies in supervision and staffing led to “a stunning array of assaults, as well as deaths.”\n\nSeven people died last year while detained at the jail, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves said. Reeves wrote in his ruling that cell doors did not lock and a lack of lighting in cells makes life “miserable for the detainees who live there and prevents guards from adequately surveilling detainees.”\n\nHe also said guards sometimes slept instead of monitoring the cameras in the control room.\n\nFederal and state judges had only ordered receiverships or similar transfers of control for prisons and jails about eight times before Reeves’ order, according to Hernandez Stroud, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.\n\nBut just days before the appointed receiver was scheduled to assume control over the jail on Jan. 1, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the lower court’s order until it ruled on the county’s motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe court was to examine whether the lower court’s injunction complies with the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a 1996 federal law that places restrictions on lawsuits brought by prisoners.\n\nHinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said in December that county officials were committed to fixing the issues at the jail, many of which stem from staffing shortages.\n\nHinds County officials applauded the stay.

NMSP officers also asked motorist if they've seen the men or any suspicious men in the area and showed motorists a description and mugshots of Cruz and Clah.\n\nBoth were shackled with leg irons and belly chains and wearing white prison jumpsuits before they fled. They were later seen on surveillance video that surfaced late Thursday afternoon showing each wearing jeans and jackets at an intersection in Albuquerque.\n\nThe video was shot around 4:30 a.m. Thursday, some seven hours after authorities believe the men made their escape and at least 200 miles north of where corrections officers reported seeing them last.\n\nThey were last accounted for around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday with three other inmates being transported between prisons in Roswell and Las Cruces.\n\nCorrections officers didn’t realize Cruz and Clah were missing until around 1 a.m. Thursday. The public was alerted several hours later.\n\nAuthorities said the men should be considered armed and dangerous.\n\nCruz, 32, has been serving a life sentence since 2007 for killing a man over drugs in Raton in northern New Mexico. Clah, 29, was convicted in Farmington in 2009 of armed robbery and assault with intent to commit a violent felony on a peace officer.\n\nCruz has the word “TRIBAL” tattooed on his neck, while “SHIPROCK NATIVE” is tattooed on Clah’s neck and feathers has been inked on his left cheek.\n\n“Pretty hard to miss,” Marcantel said at a news conference in Santa Fe.\n\nAuthorities were struggling as they searched for the men.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s really going to be probably solved by someone who calls us,” Marcantel said.\n\nThe search was joined by the U.S. Border Patrol and local police departments, and involved dogs, aircraft and foot patrols.

Arrington is suspected of killing a man and stealing his pickup truck after the escape.\n\nThe owner of the torched Conway home said he saw someone matching Arrington’s description hiding inside a trailer behind his house on Tuesday evening. He notified the sheriff’s office and fled with his family. Investigators searched the property, but there was no trace of Arrington. They continued the search through the night with drones and a helicopter.\n\nAround 7 a.m. Wednesday, Atkinson and a deputy returned to the property with the homeowner. After a short meeting, the homeowner discovered Arrington inside. He sprinted outside and alerted the officers, who were standing in the driveway. Arrington then exchanged gunfire with them through a window, striking the deputy in the leg, Atkinson said.\n\nWithin a two-hour period, the house was set ablaze from within, he said. Investigators waited until the fire was out before they approached the home and found a body.\n\nThe injured deputy was transported to a hospital where he was stabilized.\n\nMultiple law enforcement agencies continued searching parts of the state, after the Leake County Sheriff's Office told residents to “please keep your doors locked and have no keys or weapons in your vehicles.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are among the agencies assisting in the search.\n\nPolice said Anthony Watts, a 61-year-old church pastor, was shot and killed Monday around 7 p.m. on Interstate 55 in Jackson after he pulled over to help a man who had wrecked a motorcycle.

Authorities have advised his “potential targets” about his escape and the threats against them and have taken “appropriate protective actions,” the agency said.\n\nCasey White should be considered extremely dangerous, authorities have said. He was in the Lauderdale County jail awaiting trial for the capital murder charges against him and was also serving a 75-year sentence for a series of crimes committed in 2015.\n\nThe US Marshals Service released these images of Casey White's tattoos.

The house sold for $95,550, documents show, but county records list the current total parcel value of the property at $235,600.\n\nVicky White and Casey White’s relationship can be traced to 2020, when the inmate was taken to Lauderdale County for arraignment on murder charges, according to the sheriff.\n\nThe pair had a “special relationship” that was confirmed, in part, by other inmates who told authorities Casey White “was getting extra food on his trays” and “was getting privileges no one else got. And this was all coming from her,” Singleton said.\n\nThe pair kept communicating after Casey White was transferred back to the state prison, the sheriff said. Casey White returned to the Lauderdale County Detention Facility in February to attend court hearings in his capital murder case.\n\nVicky White stayed at a Quality Inn hotel in Florence on Thursday night, the night before the two disappeared, Singleton said.

Police say the two are not related.\n\nCasey White, 38, was serving a 75-year prison sentence for kidnapping and attempted murder charges when he vanished. While in custody, he also confessed to the 2015 killing of a woman who was stabbed to death in her home.\n\n“Casey White, as you’ve heard me say over and over and over is an extremely dangerous person and we need to get him located and get him off the street,” Singleton said. \"Don't take any chances with him. He's extremely dangerous.\"\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nWhat are police saying?\n\nVicky White was armed when she left the jail with Casey White for a mental health evaluation for Casey at a courthouse Friday morning, Sheriff Rick Singleton said at a news conference Friday.\n\nBut no mental health evaluation was scheduled at the courthouse for Casey White that day, Singleton said.\n\nHe said the inmate was handcuffed and shackled when he and the officer left the jail Friday. Singleton said the officer was transporting the inmate alone – a violation of department policy. The policy was instituted when White was jailed two years ago and authorities believed he was planning to escape.\n\nThe pair wasn't discovered missing until 3:30 p.m. Friday afternoon, six hours after they left the jail. The police vehicle they left in was found in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center.\n\nDeputies had attempted to contact the officer once they realized she and the inmate were missing, but her phone repeatedly went to voicemail.\n\nSingleton said video showed the pair left the jail and went straight to the parking lot where the officer's vehicle was found.\n\nSingleton said investigators are trying determine whether there were any previous significant interactions between the pair.\n\nWho is Casey Cole White?\n\nCasey White was sentenced in 2019 to 75 years in prison after being convicted of two counts of first-degree kidnapping and attempted murder, according to a report from The News Courier in Athens, Alabama.\n\nCasey White also confessed to the killing of Connie Ridgeway, 58, and was set to go to trial next month in the case. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Ridgeway was stabbed to death in her home in 2015.\n\nCasey White stands at 6 foot, 9 inches and weighs about 260 pounds, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. He has brown hair, hazel eyes and has tattoos on his back and left shoulder blade.\n\nAt the Monday news conference, authorities said he may have attempted to change his appearance but his height and build make him easy to identify.\n\nHe is believed to be a \"serious threat to the corrections officer and the public,\" according to Marty Keely, the U.S. marshal for northern Alabama. Authorities advised residents not to approach him if he is spotted.\n\nHe was at the local jail Friday because of his latest charge.\n\nWho is Vicky White?\n\nVicky White worked as assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office and has been with the department for 16 years. Singleton described her as an \"exemplary employee\" who was \"admired and respected by her co-workers and subordinates.\"\n\nVicky White was working her last day at the sheriff's office Friday, having turned in paperwork to retire, Singleton said Monday. He also said she had sold her home around a month ago and “talked about going to the beach.”\n\nThe sheriff said they were shocked by the events, describing the day she disappeared as being \"like a wake at a funeral\" at the detention center.\n\n“This is not the Vicky White we know, by any stretch of the imagination,” the sheriff said.\n\nSingleton said fellow jail employees were “just devastated.”\n\nHe told CNN that while it appeared she helped in the escape, investigators were keeping an open mind: \"She absolutely assisted him. We still don't know 100% for sure that it was willful, but it's certainly looking that way.\"\n\nAs an assistant director for corrections, Vicky White moved throughout the county detention facility several times a day and had multiple opportunities every day to be in contact with any given inmate, the sheriff said. Her job duties also included coordinating the transport of inmates.\n\nVicky White’s mother, Pat Davis, told WAAY that she is in shock and scared for her daughter.\n\n“As a mother, I didn’t know how to act because I thought at first it was a mistake. And then when I found out for sure it was, it was just disbelief,” says Pat Davis. She told the station that “we just want her back” and found it difficult to believe her daughter would help an inmate escape.\n\n“She’s never done anything, I bet she’s never even had a speeding ticket,” Pat Davis said.\n\nThe Marshals Service said people with information about Casey White’s location or Vicky White’s disappearance can call 800-336-0102.

Ryan Dowdy of the Excelsior Springs police told reporters outside Haslett’s home. He said investigators are still processing evidence taken from Haslett’s home and that the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAccording to the probable cause form, T.J. said she escaped from a room in the man’s basement. Haslett’s neighbors told KMBC and KCTV that TJ went to multiple homes to seek help while Haslett took his child to school. T.J. also said there were other women, but police have found no evidence of others so far.\n\nThe woman’s escape comes weeks after community leaders said they told authorities that they believed a potential predator was targeting Black women in the Kansas City area. Authorities from the Kansas City Police Department initially called the reports of a serial killer targeting Black women “completely unfounded,” according to a statement published by the Kansas City Star newspaper.\n\nT.J. was wearing latex lingerie, a metal collar with a padlock, and had duct tape around her neck when she escaped, according to the probable cause form.\n\nLisa Johnson, a neighbor of Haslett whom T.J. encountered during her escape, told KMBC that T.J. feared Haslett would kill them if she called the police. Johnson told affiliate KCTV she called police after TJ ran to another home for help. Ciara Tharp told CNN affiliate KCTV that her grandmother let T.J. in when she came to her house for help.\n\nTharpe says once her grandmother let T.J. inside, she said that Haslett had kidnapped her and killed her friends, according to KCTV. The probable cause form identifies the woman who contacted police as Lisa Cashatt. Cadaver dogs were seen searching Haslett’s backyard, KMBC reports, but investigators have yet to find other missing people in the man’s home.\n\n“We have no further victims that we are aware of at this specific moment in time,” Dowdy told CNN affiliate KCTV. “She made mention of other victims, but there’s no signs of them at this time that we have found.”\n\nHaslett was arrested on Oct. 7 and was charged with first-degree rape, first-degree kidnapping and second-degree assault. He’s being held on a $500,000 bond. His bail reduction hearing was originally scheduled for Tuesday but has been postponed to Nov. 8 per his attorney’s request. Haslett’s public defender told CNN they have no comment.\n\n“We know certain things because we have charged an individual in this horrific crime but by no means do I know all the details,” Robert Sanders, Clay County, Missouri, Prosecuting Attorney told to CNN affiliate KMBC. “We need more information.”\n\nThe Kansas City Police Department said that “in September we were made aware of a social media post claiming there had been four black women murdered in Kansas City and three black women missing from 85th Street/Prospect Avenue. To date, we have had no reports of missing black females from that area.”\n\n“In order to begin a missing persons investigation, someone would need to file a report with our department identifying the missing party,” said the Excelsior Springs Police Department in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe department said it has activated the Clay County Investigative Squad Task Force, which includes members from other local law enforcement organizations, for its ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nBut residents and missing persons advocates say T.J.’s account of what happened to her, and Haslett’s arrest, underscore the indifference by some in law enforcement when it comes to reports of missing Black people.\n\nBishop Tony Caldwell said the victim's kidnapping is part of a much larger problem of Black people being abducted and written off by law enforcement. KMBC\n\nBishop Tony Caldwell was among the community leaders who first raised concerns about missing Black women in the Kansas City area. Caldwell has been serving the community for years and said that T.J.’s case is part of a much larger problem of Black people being abducted and written off by law enforcement.\n\n“If that young lady would not have escaped, we wouldn’t be talking today,” Caldwell told CNN. He said that when family and friends come forward and tell authorities that their loved ones are missing, they’re often written off as ‘runaways’ and not taken seriously.\n\nRyan Sorrell, founder of the Kansas City Defender digital news site says police wrote off their reporting of community concerns as rumors.\n\n“Rumors is really a demeaning and almost dehumanizing way for the police to respond to the situation,” Sorrell told CNN, adding the most vulnerable people often don’t have people who can file a formal missing person’s report for them.\n\n“For them to simply say, if you don’t have a formal police report filed in your name, then you don’t matter. That’s what we think is really the worst and most horrific aspect of this situation,” Sorrell said.\n\nIt is unclear whether T.J. was ever reported missing.\n\nIn response to the community members’ criticism, the Excelsior Springs Police Department also said, “We have checked with law enforcement agencies in the Kansas City metropolitan area and there are no current missing persons reports that correspond with the evidence examined so far in this investigation.”\n\nBut Justice Gaston, a local Kansas City activist told CNN she’s not shocked by the police response to community concerns.\n\n“It does not surprise me that we went [to police] and were ignored once again,” she said.\n\nCaldwell told CNN that on Monday night, Kansas City area community leaders met for five hours with residents to discuss their anger about the case and what they perceive as law enforcement’s indifference and the vulnerability of Black women and girls. He told CNN that about 50 people attended the meeting.\n\nHe said community leaders don’t want to be perceived as attacking the police. But more important to them than avoiding that perception is knowing that their concerns are taken seriously by law enforcement.\n\n“We need cooperation [from law enforcement] to get people home. We can argue over terminology all day long, but we gotta get people home safe.”\n\nThere’s ‘no sense of urgency,’ activist says\n\nCaldwell said he and other community leaders’ concerns were dismissed by authorities when they initially alleged that young women were being abducted from Prospect Avenue, an area of Kansas City notorious for sex workers. Caldwell said that most of the women working in that area are Black.\n\n“They don’t talk to the police department because the police never believe them, or they believe that the police aren’t gonna do anything about it,” Caldwell told CNN, adding that police never go to Prospect Avenue to investigate missing person reports but instead frequently visit the area to make arrests for prostitution.\n\nWhile TJ said she was kidnapped by Haslett near Prospect Avenue, CNN has not been able to ascertain if she was a sex worker.\n\nWhen reached by CNN about the concerns raised by Caldwell and others, the Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) said, “we respond every day to Prospect Avenue for calls for service.”\n\nKCPD also said the department will continue to be responsive to community concerns and incidents that are reported to them. They encourage the public to report any missing person so their circumstances can be investigated.\n\nCaldwell said it’s time authorities take reports of missing women seriously, even if the person reporting it has limited information about them.\n\n“People use street names all the time, and just because you don’t have 99% of the information about a person doesn’t mean that they’re still not worthy of being looked for,” Caldwell said.\n\nDerrica Wilson, co-founder and CEO of the Black and Missing Foundation, Inc., agreed with the sentiment that law enforcement isn’t taking these cases as seriously as they should.\n\n“Quite frankly, there’s no sense of urgency in finding them, because there’s the perception that they ran away. So, whatever happens to him or her, they brought it on themselves,” Wilson told CNN.\n\n“And when it’s adults, law enforcement likes to associate their disappearance with some sort of criminal activity, and it really desensitizes and dehumanizes the fact that these are mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters. They are valuable members of our community, and they deserve the same resources in finding them.”\n\nDespite only making up 13% of the United States population, Black people comprise 34% of missing person cases in 2021, according to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center.", "authors": ["Justin Gamble Jalen Brown", "Justin Gamble", "Jalen Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}]}

Why is its ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN —\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic ground the transportation industry to a screeching halt in early 2020, the US government doled out more than $54 billion in aid to help pay employees and keep the systems from buckling.\n\nSouthwest Airlines received more than $7 billion from that program. But its system had two major meltdowns in the past 18 months, including this week’s massive system failure the likes of which the aviation industry has never seen.\n\nHowever, analysts say, Southwest’s service meltdown is unrelated to the taxpayer assistance the airline received in 2020. Although undoubtedly aggravating for stranded travelers, the billions of dollars taxpayers forked over to Southwest could not have been directed to solve the particular problems that caused this week’s snafu.\n\nCancelled Southwest Airlines flights are seen on the flight schedules at LaGuardia Airport, Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2022, in New York. The U.S. Department of Transportation says it will look into flight cancellations by Southwest that have left travelers stranded at airports across the country amid an intense winter storm. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) Yuki Iwamura/AP\n\n[The pandemic aid] “is water under the bridge at this point,” said Robert Mann, a Port Washington, New York-based airline industry analyst. “The only distinguishing factors at this point are to what degree carriers have satisfied obligations that permit them to either return to paying dividends or return to paying higher officer salaries.”\n\nWhen air travel plunged in early 2020, the government stepped in with financial assistance to keep the airlines running. Preventing layoffs and furloughs in the transportation sector was a critical focal point as employees such as pilots are subject to training requirements and other certifications that, if lagged, could significantly disrupt air travel for a considerable time.\n\nThe Payroll Support Program, which started in March 2020 and was reupped two times in 2021, was similar in nature to the Payroll Protection Program that was meant to help smaller businesses keep employees paid and working during the pandemic.\n\nThe federal aid to airlines, which was a mix of grants and loans, came with some caveats: The airlines had to use the funds exclusively to continue paying wages, salaries and benefits to employees; and, for specific periods of time, they couldn’t conduct furloughs or layoffs; issue dividends or stock buybacks; or increase pay for executives.\n\nBy the carriers and airline unions’ accounts, the program ultimately was a success.\n\n“It worked,” Gary Kelly, Southwest’s former chief executive officer, said in December 2021 during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing to examine the impact of the PSP.\n\n“Funds received through each round of the PSP were only used for qualifying employee salaries, wages, and benefits,” he added. “We did not cut pay rates; we did not cut hours; we did not cut benefits; we did not layoff; we did not furlough. We actually raised our minimum pay to $15 per hour, effective August 1, 2021.”\n\nKelly noted that Southwest’s financially conservative approach that put it in a healthy position entering 2020, and the airline’s cost-cutting throughout the pandemic, had it on good footing for the future.\n\nBut this wasn’t a short-term event. As the pandemic spread and the virus evolved, demand bottomed out for travel, straining airlines’ operations. To save on costs, and to avoid layoffs, airlines including Southwest offered voluntary buyouts, leaves of absence and early retirement packages.\n\nEarlier this year, as Southwest and other airlines struggled with staffing shortages, two House Democrats asked the Treasury Department’s inspector general to investigate whether any of the PSP funds were used for the buyouts, which ultimately helped contribute to staffing shortages and service disruptions when demand returned.\n\nWhat caused the meltdown\n\nExperts, employees and even the CEO admit that Southwest’s mess was decades in the making.\n\nSouthwest’s meltdown this past weekend, a massive cascading wave of cancellations that stranded tens of thousands of passengers and overwhelming the airline’s internal systems, were a culmination of issues brewing for years, Captain Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association told CNN this week.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nMurray noted that Southwest’s ancient scheduling system hasn’t changed much since the 1990s. Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson told employees this week that the outdated scheduling system was the main culprit for the outage.\n\nSouthwest’s “point-to-point” model also didn’t help. The operational approach involves planes flying consecutive routes, picking up crews at those locations and relying on short turnaround times.\n\n“When they have cancellations in one area, it really ripples through, because they don’t necessarily have their crews and their pilots in the right positions,” said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst of equity research for Edward Jones. “They just kind of build on from city to city to city, and when that gets disrupted, it’s very difficult to get the operations flowing smoothly again.”\n\nSouthwest acknowledged many of the concerns raised by Murray and others.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told employees in a memo obtained by CNN. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nBailout money specifically meant to support workers\n\nThe PSP amounts were based on the carriers’ 2019 salary levels, which themselves were based on pre-pandemic flying levels. In April 2020, airline passenger traffic plummeted 96% and stayed 60% below 2019 levels in 2020, according to the US Government Accountability Office.\n\n“No carrier was operating a 2019 level of flying,” Mann said. “In fact, while saying ‘no layoffs,’ numerous carriers cut hours and related pay. Many others initiated voluntary separation agreements that paid fewer hours and salary dollars over a defined future period in exchange for early retirements or similar.”\n\nMann said that means it’s highly unlikely that any airline paid the full amount of PSP to salaries. Where did the excess PSP money go?\n\n“Could have been as simple as fuel, interest payments, other overheads,” he said. “But the idea that PSP would have paid for IT upgrades that a carrier saw no need for is not realistic.”\n\nBut Southwest will have to focus on its technology after its service meltdown.\n\n“Now that the problem has occurred, and at [the Department of Transportation] and the market’s urging, I suspect the carrier has a different view of what IT upgrades are necessary,” he said. “They’ll spend their own money now to research, develop and implement new systems.”\n\nStaffing shortages\n\nStaffing issues also contributed to both of Southwest’s recent service outages, even if it wasn’t the primary factor in the latest meltdown.\n\nSouthwest, like other airlines – and other industries – has struggled with staffing shortages amid the recovery from the pandemic.\n\n“The entire industry has been running, I won’t say running on empty, but running on reserve,” Mann said.\n\nTravelers wait at George Bush Intercontinental Airport on December 27, 2022, in Houston, Texas, after Southwest canceled approximately 5,400 flights in less than 48 hours. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nIn October 2021, Southwest had 7,000 fewer employees than it did pre-pandemic, according to Transportation Department data. The airline cited “inadequate staffing” following the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights during the Indigenous Peoples Day/Columbus Day weekend.\n\n“We are still not where we want to be with staffing, and in particular with our flight crews,” then-COO Mike Van de Ven said in a recorded video to employees. A transcript of the recording was shared with CNN at the time. “We simply need more staffing cushion for the unexpected in this environment and we are bringing new people on board every day,” he said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nSouthwest will attempt to move forward from its pitfalls under the watchful eye of the US government.\n\nThe Department of Transportation said it is investigating Southwest’s spate of cancellations and customer service delays. President Joe Biden said his administration “is working to ensure airlines are held accountable.”\n\nDemocratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut issued a new letter Tuesday calling on Southwest to pay up for what they say were avoidable holiday cancellations.\n\n“Southwest is planning to issue a $428 million dividend next year – the company can afford to do right by the consumers it has harmed,” they wrote. “Southwest should focus first on its customers stranded at airports and stuck on interminable hold.”\n\nUS Senator Maria Cantwell, who chaired the Senate committee hearing last year, issued a statement Tuesday pledging the panel would be looking into the causes behind Southwest Airlines cascade of flight cancellations.\n\n“The problems at Southwest Airlines over the last several days go beyond weather,” she said in a statement. “The committee will be looking into the causes of these disruptions and its impact on consumers.”\n\n– CNN’s Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox, David Goldman, and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August.

Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23.

Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Wall Street's biggest winners and losers in 2022 ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

The S&P 500 is down nearly 20% and with two trading days left in the year, investors’ hopes of a miraculous recovery have been dashed.\n\nBut even when the overall market is losing, there are still winners – and there were quite a few of them this year – mostly in energy, which has been the best-performing sector of 2022.\n\nHere are the big winners, and losers, of the year.\n\nThe winners: The story of 2022 has been energy.\n\nBrutally high oil and gas prices were the talk of the town this year and one of the largest contributing factors to sky-high inflation. That’s bad news for drivers, but ended up being great for the energy industry as oil prices and energy stocks are closely interlinked.\n\nThe energy sector has so far returned more than 60% this year, significantly outperforming every other S&P 500 sector. No other sector has gained even 5% year-to-date.\n\nOccidental Petroleum has been the biggest gainer of the year in the S&P 500, up 122% year-to-date.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEGDX) is in second place, up 109% and Hess (HES) comes in third with a gain of 94%. Rounding up the top ten are Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Exxon (XOM), Schlumberger (SLB), APA (APA), First Solar (FSLR), Halliburton (HAL) and Marathon oil (MRO), all up between about 70 and 80% this year.\n\nGas and oil prices have been falling in recent weeks, but they’re still higher than they have been over the past few years. That’s contributed to record-breaking profits at major energy companies. The net income of global oil and gas producers is expected to double in 2022 to a record $4 trillion, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nIn the third quarter, 81% of all energy companies in the S&P 500 reported earnings above estimates, the highest of any sector, according to Factset data. The energy sector reported the highest year-over-year earnings growth of all 11 sectors, at 137.3%.\n\nThe losers: This was the year of no more free lunch in Silicon Valley.\n\nBig Tech soared to new heights over the past decade as the companies enjoyed a low-interest rate, low inflation environment. That’s no longer the case, tech and communications stock prices clearly reflect that.\n\nEnergy technology solution company Generac Holdings (GNRC) is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 so far this year, down about 74%. Coming in second is dating app company Match Group (MTCH), which is down 70%. Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) is also down about 70%, making the auto tech company the third worst performer this year. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, also makes an appearance in the bottom ten stocks– down 65%.\n\nThat’s a huge shake-up, at the start of this year Tesla was the fifth most valuable company in the S&P 500 and Meta was sixth.\n\nBig tech had a nightmare year in 2022– collectively losing nearly $4 trillion in market value in 2022. That’s a lot when you consider the 10 worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 have wiped out a market value of about $1.6 trillion.\n\nEven Apple, generally considered more resilient than other tech companies, is down 31%, more than the overall market in 2022.\n\nWall Street is hoping for a tech rebound next year, but with more interest rate hikes on their way and a possible recession, investors may be left waiting.\n\nSBF borrowed $546 million from his hedge fund to buy Robinhood stake\n\nSam Bankman-Fried bought a nearly 7.6% stake in Robinhood (HOOD) earlier this year, financed with half a billion dollars borrowed from his hedge fund. The same one that prosecutors say was illegally funneling customer funds from its affiliated platform, FTX.\n\nIn an affidavit that emerged Tuesday, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang borrowed more than $546 million from the hedge fund, Alameda Research. He then used the money to purchase a large stake in Robinhood, reports my colleague Allison Morrow.\n\nWhy it matters: Bankman-Fried’s stake in Robinhood is now at the center of a separate, multinational legal battle over the assets associated with FTX’s bankrupt crypto empire.\n\nFour separate entities have laid claim to the approximately 56 million shares, worth about $450 million. SBF really wants to hold on to those shares himself– he’s leaning on them as a source of payment for legal expenses, according to FTX.\n\nIt’s not clear from the court filings whether the $546 million used to purchase the stake included funds that prosecutors allege were stolen from customer deposits in FTX.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent crypto winter has been bad news for Robinhood. The company laid off 23% of its staff in August after cutting 9% of its employees in April. The online brokerage’s stock is down nearly 60% year-to-date.\n\nSouthwest’s meltdown continues\n\nSouthwest (LUV) is in the middle of a service meltdown – canceling thousands of flights during the busiest travel days of the year and leaving a trail of angry investors, government officials, employees and tens of thousands of stranded customers in its wake.\n\nThe company’s stock fell about 5% on Wednesday after a 6% drop on Tuesday – its largest tumble in five months. The airliner is currently down about 27% this year as investors fear the worst for the fate of the company that just can’t seem to get it together.\n\nSo what happened? ​​Experts, employees and even the CEO admit that Southwest’s mess was decades in the making, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” Captain Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association told CNN this week. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nMurray noted that Southwest’s ancient scheduling system hasn’t changed much since the 1990s. Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson told employees this week that the outdated scheduling system was the main culprit for the outage.\n\nSouthwest’s “point-to-point” model also didn’t help. The operational approach involves planes flying consecutive routes, picking up crews at those locations and relying on short turnaround times.\n\n“When they have cancellations in one area, it really ripples through, because they don’t necessarily have their crews and their pilots in the right positions,” said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst of equity research for Edward Jones. “They just kind of build on from city to city to city, and when that gets disrupted, it’s very difficult to get the operations flowing smoothly again.”\n\nSouthwest acknowledged many of the concerns raised by Murray and others.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering from is a lack of tools,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told employees in a memo obtained by CNN. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nWhat’s next: The Department of Transportation said it is investigating Southwest’s spate of cancellations and customer service delays. President Joe Biden said his administration “is working to ensure airlines are held accountable.”\n\nDemocratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut issued a new letter Tuesday calling on Southwest to pay up for what they say were avoidable holiday cancellations.\n\n“Southwest is planning to issue a $428 million dividend next year – the company can afford to do right by the consumers it has harmed,” they wrote. “Southwest should focus first on its customers stranded at airports and stuck on interminable hold.”\n\nOther airlines, meanwhile, are doing their best to pick up the slack. United and American Airlines (AAL) said they would place price caps on travel to and from select cities designed to help the melted-down airline’s customers get home without breaking the bank.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/business/russia-economy-ukraine-six-months/index.html", "title": "Russia dodges economic collapse but the decline has started | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nSix months after invading Ukraine, Russia is bogged down in a war of attrition it didn’t anticipate but it is having success on another front — its oil-dependent economy is in a deep recession but proving far more resilient than expected.\n\n“I’m driving through Moscow and the same traffic jams are there as before,” says Andrey Nechaev, who was Russia’s economy minister in the early 1990s.\n\nThe readiness of China and India to snap up cheap Russian oil has helped, but Nechaev and other analysts say Russia’s economy has started to decline and is likely facing a prolonged period of stagnation as a consequence of Western sanctions.\n\nOn the surface, not much has changed, bar a few empty storefronts that once housed Western brands that have fled the country in their hundreds. McDonalds (MCD) is now called “Vkusno i tochka”, or “Tasty, and that’s it” and Starbucks (SBUX) cafes are now gradually reopening under the barely disguised brand Stars Coffee.\n\nThe streets of Moscow are as busy as ever. Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe exodus of Western businesses, and wave after wave of punishing Western sanctions targeting Russia’s vital energy exports and its financial system, are having an impact, but not in the way many had expected.\n\nNechaev, who presided over some of Russia’s most turbulent economic times and helped steer its transition to a market economy, credits some of this to the central bank.\n\nThe ruble did crash to a record low to the US dollar earlier this year in the wake of the invasion as the West froze about half of Russia’s $600 billion foreign currency reserves. But it’s bounced back since to its strongest level against the US dollar since 2018. (Remember President Joe Biden’s threat of reducing it to “rubble”?)\n\nThat’s largely the result of aggressive capital controls and rate hikes back in the spring, much of which have now been reversed. Interest rates are now lower than before the war, and the central bank says inflation, which peaked at almost 18% in April, is slowing and will be between 12% and 15% for the full year.\n\nThe central bank has also revised up its GDP forecast for the year, and now expects it to shrink by 4% to 6%. In April, the forecast was for an 8% to 10% contraction. The International Monetary Fund also now predicts a 6% contraction.\n\nMoscow had been trying to build a 'fortress economy' since annexing Crimea in 2014. Natalia Koleniskova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt helped that the Kremlin had eight years to prepare, spurred by the sanctions the West imposed after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\n“The exit of Mastercard, Visa, it barely had an impact on domestic payments because the central bank had its own alternative system of payments,” says Nechaev.\n\nRussia set up the Mir credit card, and its own transaction processing system in 2017.\n\nAnd there’s a reason Russian fans of McDonalds and Starbucks are still able to get their fast-food fix, says Chris Weafer, founding partner of Macro Advisory Ltd, a consultancy advising multinational businesses in Russia and Eurasia.\n\nNot lovin' it: How Russians reacted to McDonald's closing 01:01 - Source: CNN\n\nSince 2014, many Western brands in Russia caved to government pressure and localized some or all of their supply chains. So when these companies left, it was relatively easy for Russian buyers to buy them and keep running them simply by changing the wrapper and packaging.\n\n“Same people, same products, same supply,” says Weafer.\n\nIt’s not an entirely watertight strategy, though.\n\nThe re-branded McDonald’s stores reported a shortage of French fries in mid-July, when Russia’s potato harvest fell short, and foreign suppliers wouldn’t fill the gap due to sanctions.\n\nCan Russia’s energy boom continue?\n\nFast food continuity is one thing. Russia’s longer term stability rests on its energy sector, still by far the biggest source of government revenues.\n\nTo say high energy prices have so far insulated Russia would be an understatement.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says Russia’s revenues from selling oil and gas to Europe doubled between March and July this year, compared to an average of recent years. That’s despite declining volumes. IEA data shows gas deliveries to Europe are down by about 75% over the past 12 months.\n\nOil is a different matter. The IEA’s March prediction that 3 million barrels a day of Russian oil would come off the market from April because of sanctions, or the threat of them, has not materialized. Exports have held up, though Rystad Energy analysts note a slight drop over the summer.\n\nThe major factor has been Russia’s ability to find new markets in Asia.\n\nAccording to Houmayoun Falakshali from commodities consultancy Kpler, most of Russia’s seaborne oil exports have gone to Asia since the start of the war. In July, the share was 56%, compared to just 37% in July 2021.\n\nRussian seaborne oil exports to Asia have soared this year. Tatiana Meel/Reuters\n\nBetween January and July this year, China increased its seaborne imports of heavily-discounted Russian Urals crude by 40%, compared to the same period last year, according to Kpler data. That’s despite China’s initial efforts to avoid the appearance of taking sides in Russia’s war on Ukraine. India’s seaborne imports from Russia are up more than 1,700% over the same period, according to Kpler. Russia has also been increasing gas exports to China through a Siberian pipeline.\n\nWhat happens when Europe’s embargo on 90% of Russian oil comes into force in December, will be critical. An estimated 2 million barrels a day of Russian oil will be in limbo, and while it’s likely some of that will go to Asia, experts doubt whether demand will be high enough to absorb it all.\n\nFalakshali says China cannot buy much more Russian oil than it already is, because of a domestic slowdown in demand, and because it simply doesn’t need much more of the specific type of oil Russia exports.\n\nPrice will play a critical role, too, in whether Russia can afford to keep discounting to secure new markets.\n\n“A discount of 30% from $120 a barrel is one thing,” Nechaev points out. “A discount from $70 is another matter.”\n\n‘Slower burn’\n\nWhile global inflation is helping Russia’s energy sector, it’s hurting its people. Much like the rest of Europe, Russians are already suffering a cost of living crisis, made much worse by the war in Ukraine.\n\nNechaev, who helped steer Russia through a much more dramatic economic collapse in the 1990s, is worried.\n\n“In terms of the standard of living, if you measure it by real incomes, we have gone backwards by about 10 years,” he says.\n\nThe Russian government is spending to try to combat this. In May, it announced it would raise pensions and the minimum wage by 10%.\n\nIt’s set up a system where employees of companies that have “suspended their activities” can temporarily transfer to another employer without breaking their employment contract. And it’s spending 17 billion rubles ($280 million) buying the bonds of Russian airlines, crippled by airspace bans and sanctions preventing maintenance and the supply of parts by foreign manufacturers.\n\nIt’s technology sanctions, like those affecting the airline industry that may have the most profound impact on Russia’s long-term economic prospects. In June, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said global semiconductor exports to Russia had collapsed by 90% since the war started. That is crippling production of everything from cars to computers, and will, experts say, put it further behind in the global technology race.\n\n“The impact of sanctions will be more a slower burn rather than a quick hit,” says Weafer. “Russia is now looking at potentially a long period of stagnation.”\n\nNechaev is even more definitive. “Right now, the economic decline has started,” he says.", "authors": ["Clare Sebastian"], "publish_date": "2022/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "What the wave of tech layoffs tell us about the economy | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

Job cuts and pauses on hiring are beginning to flow across the tech sector, which boasts some of the most valuable companies in the world. That’s bad news for the economy as a whole.\n\nWhat’s happening: Tech companies are announcing an alarming number of layoffs and hiring freezes.\n\n▸ Amazon (AMZN) announced on Thursday that it is pressing pause on corporate hiring. “We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business to adjust as we think makes sense,” wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon (AMZN) in a note to employees.\n\nLate last month, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected, causing its stock to fall sharply. Shares of Amazon are down more than 47% this year.\n\n▸ Apple (AAPL) has reportedly instituted a hiring freeze of its own in all areas except research and development. In a statement, Apple (AAPL) said that it will continue to hire and is confident in its future, “but given the current economic environment we’re taking a very deliberate approach in some parts of the business.”\n\nLike other tech companies, Apple is worried about slower growth during the holiday season, higher interest rates and waning consumer spending. Covid lockdowns in China are also hurting production of the iPhone 14. Apple stock is down about 25% so far this year.\n\n▸ Meta is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The parent company of Facebook (FB), Instagram and WhatsApp could cut thousands of jobs from its workforce of 87,000, and an announcement could come as soon as Wednesday, according to the report.\n\n▸ Lyft (LYFT) said last Thursday that it will lay off 13% of its employees, or nearly 700 people, as it rethinks staffing amid rising inflation and fears of a looming recession. “We know today will be hard,” Lyft (LYFT) founders Logan Green and John Zimmer wrote in an employee memo obtained by CNN. “We’re facing a probable recession sometime in the next year and rideshare insurance costs are going up.”\n\nIn a filing announcing the layoffs, Lyft said it would likely incur $27 to $32 million in restructuring charges. “We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,” Lyft’s founders wrote in the memo to staffers. Shares of the car-share company are down nearly 70% so far this year.\n\n▸ Online payments giant Stripe will lay off about 14% of its staff, CEO Patrick Collison wrote in a memo to staff Thursday. “We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown,” Collison wrote in the note. Just last year, Stripe became the most valuable US startup, with a valuation of $95 billion.\n\nChime, a private fintech firm, also announced it will lay off 12% of its 1,300-person workforce.\n\n▸ Twitter on Friday announced extreme layoffs, noting that offices would be locked and badge access suspended as new CEO Elon Musk cuts about half of its 7,500-person workforce.\n\nThe bottom line: Headline jobs numbers and third-quarter corporate earnings still reflect a strong economy overall. But other companies won’t be immune to the softening demand from consumers and businesses that tech companies have noted.\n\nAdvertiser flight hits Twitter\n\nMore bad news for Twitter (TWTR): Elon Musk said on Friday that the company has seen a “massive drop in revenue,” as a growing number of advertisers pause their spending on the platform following his controversial $44 billion acquisition of the company.\n\nHe attributed the decline to “activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.”\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS) and Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche and Bentley, have confirmed to CNN that they’ve paused their paid activities on the platform in the wake of Musk’s takeover. Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have also reportedly joined that list.\n\nOn Friday, a group of watchdog organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, increased their pressure on brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to Friday’s mass layoffs of Twitter staff as a key factor, citing fears that Musk’s cuts will make it difficult to enforce Twitter’s election integrity policies along with other anti-hate speech policy.\n\nThe takeaway: This is a key moment for Musk, who spent much of his week in New York trying to keep advertisers on board with Twitter. It doesn’t help that the uncertainty around the platform comes at a bad time for ad revenue-dependent tech companies. Google and Meta both cited lower ad payouts as a massive challenge in their most recent earnings reports.\n\nMore potential supply chain woes\n\nThe threat of a US rail strike that could disrupt supply chains is still very real.\n\nTwo rail unions reached tentative deals with the railroads in September, ahead of a strike deadline, only to have their membership vote against ratifying them. Now, US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh says that without a deal he expects Congress will step in and impose contracts on the unhappy rank-and-file union members.\n\n“My goal is to get those two unions back at the table with companies and get this thing done,” Walsh told CNN Friday. He said a negotiated agreement would be “the best thing we can do is avoid any type of rail strike or slowdown.”\n\nIf any rail unions were to go on strike, all the rail unions — which together represent about 110,000 members — would honor their picket lines and refuse to work.\n\nThat would spell bad news for supply chains. About 30% of US freight moves by rail. Prices of goods from gasoline to food and cars could soar if trains halt. In addition, factories could be forced to shut temporarily due to parts shortages. Goods that consumers want to buy during the holiday season could be missing from store shelves.\n\nWalsh was involved in a 20-hour bargaining session that reached tentative labor deals just hours before a Sept. 16 strike deadline. He said barring new negotiated agreements, Congress would have to impose a contract on the unions, as a way to keep union members on the job.\n\nIf “for some reason [one of the unions] doesn’t get to an agreement with the companies then … Congress will have to take action to avert a strike in our country,” he said.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/economy/boris-johnson-resignation-economy/index.html", "title": "UK economy: Boris Johnson leaves mess for successor to fix | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nBoris Johnson was ultimately forced to resign as UK prime minister Thursday as dozens of members of his party quit the government after one ethics scandal too many.\n\nBut his popularity outside parliament has also been badly dented by surging inflation and stagnation in the British economy, a cost-of-living crisis that threatens to impoverish millions more people this winter, and the risk of a damaging trade war with the European Union.\n\nUK stocks rose in response to reports that Johnson was preparing to stand down, and the pound gained 0.75% to trade at $1.20 — recovering slightly from two-year lows hit earlier this week.\n\n“Make no mistake however, the [pound] remains severely weak due to the dire state of the UK economy which is underperforming its peers, [and] likely to enter into a recession,” wrote Walid Koudmani, chief market analyst at broker XTB, in a note to clients.\n\nWhoever emerges from the rubble of his administration as new leader of the Conservative Party and the country, they face a series of extraordinary economic and financial challenges.\n\nThe UK has the highest inflation in the G7…\n\nEvery major economy has suffered from the pandemic’s lingering effects on supply chains, and the shock to energy and food costs delivered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nBut the United Kingdom has it worse than most of its peers. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in May, the highest among the G7 leading economies — and is forecast to climb above 11% later this year despite a series of interest rate hikes.\n\nThe knock-on effects of Brexit — Johnson’s signature achievement in government — have exacerbated crippling labor shortages and increased operating costs for businesses. The cost of imports has also been driven higher by a sharp fall in the value of the pound this year.\n\nThe rise in food and fuel prices has created the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, forcing lower-income households to choose between “heating and eating,” a rallying cry for anti-poverty campaigners as they demand more government support.\n\nJohnson’s government promised £400 ($502) in grants per family to help out the millions of people struggling to pay their energy bills. It also bowed to pressure last month and unveiled a £5 billion ($6.3 billion) tax on the windfall profits of oil and gas companies.\n\nBut those efforts are being swallowed up. Disposable incomes are on track for the second biggest fall since records began in 1964, according to the Bank of England, driven by the soaring cost of energy and food. And those bills are about to get a lot worse.\n\nAnnual average household energy bills could rise by about 50% to £3,000 ($3,600) this winter when a cap on the maximum price suppliers can charge customers is revised in the fall. The regulator already raised the cap by a whopping 54% in April.\n\nBritish households have been left particularly exposed by a persistent decline in living standards. Typical wages are no higher today than they were before the 2008 financial crisis, the Resolution Foundation said on Monday.\n\n“Britain’s poor recent record on living standards — notably the complete collapse of income growth for poor households over the past 20 years — must be turned around in the decade ahead,” said Adam Corlett, principal economist at the foundation.\n\nAnd is heading for the lowest growth…\n\nWithout stronger growth, that pay slump won’t be reversed. And there’s little prospect of that any time soon. Around the world, once-robust recoveries are being dragged down. But the United Kingdom is in a particularly bad spot, with a recession looming.\n\nThe world’s fifth-biggest economy ground to a halt in February and started shrinking in March. The decline accelerated in April, when GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.3%, with all three major sectors of the economy — services, manufacturing and construction — going backwards, according to the Office for National Statistics. Retail sales fell in May for the second consecutive month.\n\nThere’s more bad news ahead. In a report on financial stability published earlier this week, the Bank of England said that the outlook for the UK economy had “deteriorated materially.”\n\nThe Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast last month that the UK economy was heading to stagnation, with zero growth in GDP forecast for 2023. That would be the worst performance in the G7 next year.\n\nWeak growth is bad news for government debt, which has shot up to more than 90% of GDP as a result of measures taken to help businesses and households cope with the pandemic and the energy crisis.\n\nThrow in the pressures of an aging population and UK public debt is on “an unsustainable path and projected to surpass 250% of GDP over the long term,” the government’s fiscal watchdog — the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) — said on Friday.\n\nThat means there’s little room for the next prime minister to make big tax cuts or spending pledges.\n\n“This all adds up to a challenging outlook for this and future governments as they steer the UK economy and public finances in the years ahead,” the OBR added.\n\n… while Brexit hasn’t delivered\n\nJohnson succeeded where his predecessor, Theresa May, failed by “getting Brexit done.” But the break with the European Union hasn’t delivered the boost to trade that he and other Brexit advocates promised.\n\nThe United Kingdom missed out on much of the recovery in global trade since the pandemic, the OBR concluded in March.\n\nFor many businesses, the tariff-free trade deal Johnson signed with EU leaders less than two years ago has caused a huge increase in customs paperwork, making it harder for them to sell to their biggest export market and increasing the cost of imports. And deals signed with other countries barely move the needle.\n\n“While additional trade with other counties could offset some of the decline in trade with the EU, none of the agreements concluded to date are of a sufficient scale to have a material impact on our forecast,” the OBR stated.\n\nOfficial data published last week showed the UK balance of payments deficit soared to 8.3% of GDP in the first quarter of 2022, meaning the country is having to rely ever more heavily on foreign investment to make up for the fact that the country is importing far more than it exports.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the pound has been hammered this year, not helped by Johnson’s threat to tear up part of the Brexit treaty he signed. That has poisoned relations with EU leaders, and brought talk of retaliation that could escalate to a trade war that would likely hurt the United Kingdom the most.\n\n“Judging by the early line-up of potential successors to Johnson, the balance of potential outcomes would tilt towards less strained relations with the EU,” noted Kallum Pickering at Berenberg.\n\n“Even the ardent Brexiteer candidates … are less of the populist variety than Johnson. This suggests that, while it is unclear whether UK-EU relations would improve a bit or a lot, the overall situation stands to be much calmer.”", "authors": ["Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/business/russia-ruble-banks-sanctions/index.html", "title": "Russia faces financial meltdown as sanctions slam its economy", "text": "London/Moscow CNN Business —\n\nRussia was scrambling to prevent financial meltdown Monday as its economy was slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions imposed over the weekend in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin held crisis talks with his top economic advisers after the ruble crashed to a record low against the US dollar, the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and the Moscow stock exchange was shuttered for the day. It will stay closed Tuesday, the central bank announced.\n\nThe European subsidiary of Russia’s biggest bank was on the brink of collapse as savers rushed to withdraw their deposits. Economists warned that the Russian economy could shrink by 5%.\n\nThe ruble lost about 25% of its value to trade at 104 to the dollar at 12:15 p.m. ET after earlier plummeting as much as 40%. The start of trading on the Russian stock market was delayed, and then canceled entirely, according to a statement from the country’s central bank.\n\nThe latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\n“The ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,” wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\n\nPutin’s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his “fortress” economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n“We will … ban the transactions of Russia’s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin’s war,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its “rainy day fund,” senior US administration officials said.\n\n“Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,” a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia’s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n“External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. “This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,” the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports — including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia’s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n“For a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “So there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.”\n\nA run on the banks\n\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n“The sanctions target Russia’s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia’s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,” the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n“Furthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,” it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. ANTON VAGANOV/REUTERS\n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of “significant deposit outflows” triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n“This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,” the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%.

Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles — a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets.

Her place of work was her home and “my employer didn’t want me to come back,” said Maria, noting that they had “kids in the house.”\n\n“I said, ‘I don’t know where I can go.

And while some expatriates can command higher salaries for simply agreeing to move to the city, the city’s poorest are struggling just to afford food or basic necessities.\n\nHeading for the exits\n\nThe widening gap comes at a time when Hong Kong is facing an exodus of expats, despite the additional benefits on offer, which continues to raise questions about its future as a global business hub.\n\nMany foreigners have had enough of the city’s unwavering commitment to its “zero Covid” policy, even as cases surge to record highs and cause more fatalities, overloading the health care system and delivering a huge punch to the economy.\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, more residents left Hong Kong than came in, according to official population statistics. That marked a reversal from early 2019, when the population was going up.\n\nLast month alone, more than 94,000 people departed the city, while only about 23,000 came in, immigration data showed.\n\n“The recent wave of emigration is leading to a shortage of skilled workers and impacting businesses of all sizes,” the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nThe group’s chairman, Peter Wong, said the city was “facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.”\n\n“This will have a material knock-on impact on the economy,” he added. “There is real cause for concern if we cannot stem the current brain drain.”\n\nThe city has been largely sealed off from the rest of the world for the last two years, in part because most inbound travelers must quarantine in hotel rooms at their own expense for two weeks. Previously, the requirement was for three weeks.\n\nThe issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now.\n\nLast month, Mandarin Oriental (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a “very, very poor” base due to the restrictions.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.\n\nLast year, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.\n\nFrench spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.\n\nIn November, FedEx (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city’s “pandemic requirements.”\n\nFrom the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data.\n\nAsked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that “Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies.”\n\nThe representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as “a market of 86 million people.” Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years.\n\nThe government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently “risen to a record high of 9,049.”\n\nBut the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year.\n\nBASF (BASFY), a German chemicals giant, recently relocated its chief for Asia Pacific, excluding Greater China, to Singapore “after careful consideration of her office’s strategic location in the region,” according to the company.\n\nThe decision was based on “the requirement for proximity to relevant stakeholders and markets,” it told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nOthers may be biding their time. Hong Kong recently brought forward the end of the school year for some institutions to March or April, giving families more time to reevaluate their options before the new term begins in September.\n\nIn some sectors, bonus season typically takes place around this period, too.\n\n“I suspect there’s a lot of international bankers who may be waiting till then before they decide whether they’ve had their fill of Hong Kong,” said a person working in the finance industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nFree flights and country clubs\n\nThis exodus means that top companies in the city are working extra hard to attract — and retain — skilled workers.\n\nTwo senior headhunters in Hong Kong said that job candidates were increasingly pricing in the inconvenience of living in the city — if they were even persuaded to do so.\n\n“Most of them are just kind of immediately saying no,” said John Mullally, regional director of Southern China and Hong Kong financial services at recruitment agency Robert Walters.\n\n“You’ve got a smaller candidate pool, especially when it comes to those with overseas experience.”\n\nMark Tibbatts, managing director of Southern China and Taiwan for the agency Michael Page, described it as “an ongoing battle” that had made it “nigh on impossible” to lure international talent.\n\nA view of Hong Kong's skyline, captured on Wednesday. Bertha Wang/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe circumstances have revived the so-called “expat package,” which had mostly been scrapped in recent years, according to both recruiters.\n\n“Let’s go back a couple of decades. Most of the senior expats in Hong Kong were on a pretty juicy package that might have included flights home, and education, and club memberships and all these types of things,” said Tibbatts. “Over the last, let’s say, 10, 15 years, most of that’s been phased out.”\n\nNow, some of those deals are “coming back,” he added.\n\nMullally also described a rising view that Hong Kong was becoming “a bit of a hardship posting” for expats, a term that typically refers to a place with hostile living conditions.\n\nThat perception was more common from the 1970s to early 1990s, and back then justified more perks for businesspeople, he said.\n\nNow, companies are “going to have to try to bring that back because … realistically, if you want to attract people, that’s kind of the package you’ll have to put together.”\n\nNowhere to go\n\nAs international executives jump ship, blue-collar workers and the city’s poorest are being left behind to face the darkening economic outlook.\n\nIt’s not just in Hong Kong: Inequality around the world has worsened throughout the pandemic, with billionaires making unprecedented gains in wealth as tens of millions of people fall into poverty.\n\nDespite a growing shortage of domestic workers in Hong Kong, “it is not easy to say whether [the pandemic] has as a whole positively or negatively impacted them,” said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers.\n\n“We definitely have seen a number of domestic workers who are being offered higher than statutorily mandated wages due to the shortage of incoming domestic workers,” she said.\n\n“But we have also seen domestic workers being forced to take on salaries lower than the minimum allowable wage … there is a power imbalance.”\n\nFrom January 2020 to the end of 2021, the city’s number of domestic workers dropped from more than 400,000 to roughly 340,000, according to government statistics.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Hong Kong Labor Secretary Law Chi-kwong pointed to flight bans from certain countries as a possible reason for the slump, saying that some workers had likely been stranded abroad.\n\nWhen asked about the plight of domestic workers, authorities told CNN Business that foreign workers who test positive for Covid-19 “will receive support and medical treatment like local people in Hong Kong.” And, if unemployed, they will be admitted to community isolation facilities, they said.\n\nA government spokesperson also said that it “has continuously reminded employers of their statutory obligations and requirements” during the pandemic, and “any breach of such requirements will render them ineligible to employ [a domestic worker] for a period of time.”\n\n‘Zero income’\n\nWhile big international firms may have the privilege to up and move, most local businesses have no choice but to hunker down.\n\nAs many as 50,000 small businesses could shut down over the city’s fifth wave of Covid, estimates Danny Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association.\n\nThat’s about one in seven such registered entities across the city — and there could be more, he said.\n\nDespite soaring infections, Hong Kong officials have been holding onto the “zero Covid” strategy in recent weeks, introducing social distancing restrictions that have stifled local activity.\n\nMany places, such as beauty parlors and fitness studios, have been forced to stop operating for months until the current measures end.\n\nHong Kong is facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s. Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce\n\n“They don’t have any income. Zero income,” Lau said of those business owners. He added that some had resorted to operating secretly just to keep making a living.\n\nLike elsewhere, small businesses had already been hit hard earlier in the pandemic, especially by the lack of tourists.\n\nThese firms were “almost half dead,” said Lau, noting that some entrepreneurs had already taken out significant loans or dug into their reserves just to stay afloat.\n\n“The worst thing is you cannot see the future,” he added. “We don’t know how long these restrictions will last for.”", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Lizzy Yee", "Michelle Toh", "Lizzy Yee"], "publish_date": "2022/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/economy/recession-inflation-economy/index.html", "title": "'Recession shock' is coming, Bank of America warns | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBank of America is warning that high inflation poses a credible threat to the economic recovery that began just two years ago.\n\n“‘Inflation shock’ worsening, ‘rate shock’ just beginning, ‘recession shock’ coming,” Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nThe warning came ahead of a new government report on Tuesday that showed consumer prices surged by 8.5% in March, the fastest pace since December 1981. There were record year-over-year price spikes on everything from new vehicles and men’s apparel to baby food and salad dressing.\n\nInflation is “out of control,” Hartnett wrote, adding: “Inflation causes recessions.”\n\nAlthough the last recession was sparked by a pandemic, economic expansions are often ended by the Federal Reserve slamming on the brakes to fight rising inflation.\n\nMarkets are bracing for the Fed to rapidly raise interest rates, at the fastest pace in decades, to get prices under control. The risk is that the central bank will do too much, sinking the economy in the process.\n\n‘Recessionary’ price moves in markets\n\nBank of America is not outright calling for a recession in the United States. But the bank is raising the specter of a slowdown and pointing to recession signals on Wall Street.\n\nHartnett noted that price action in financial markets has been very “recessionary,” citing steep declines for economically sensitive home builders, semiconductor manufacturers, small caps, retail and private equity.\n\nGlobal growth expectations plunged to record lows in April among investment fund managers surveyed by Bank of America, according to a separate report published Monday.\n\nThat survey also showed profit expectations among investors tumbled to their weakest level since March 2020, closing in on levels seen during other scares including the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2001 bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nLast week, Deutsche Bank became the first major bank to forecast a recession. The bank expects the Fed will push the economy into a “mild” downturn that begins in late 2023.\n\nCooling off the jobs market\n\nBut others think the Fed may be able to tame inflation without causing a recession.\n\nTo get inflation under control, Goldman Sachs said in a report Monday night that economic growth must soften to a “modestly below-trend pace – enough to persuade firms to shelve some of their expansion plans, but not by so much to trigger sharp cuts in current output and employment.”\n\nWhen labor demand falls significantly, downturns tend to follow. There has never been an increase in the unemployment rate of more than 0.35 percentage points on a three-month average basis that wasn’t associated with a recession, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nAlthough the overheating jobs market has “raised the risk of recession meaningfully,” the bank is not currently forecasting a recession in the United States.\n\nGoldman Sachs said its relative optimism is based on the strong balance sheets of businesses and families and its belief that cooling off the jobs market should be made easier by the post-Covid normalization process that will let more workers come off the sidelines.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}]}

The pair exchanged toasts about the legacy of human rights and the rule of law bequeathed upon the United States by Great Britain. Meanwhile, the Queen spoke about her previous visits to the White House and the history of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Bush said during his welcome address: \"We have got a lot of things in common. Americans share the Queen's love for horses. ... Most of all what links our countries is less a place than an idea. The idea that for nearly 400 years has been America's inheritance and England's bequest: the legacy of democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights.\" Jerome Delay/AFP/Getty Images Bill Clinton: Clinton met the Queen more than once during his tenure.

I think in the imagination of people throughout America, I think what the Queen stands for and her decency and her civility, what she represents, that's very important.\" Later, during a reception for G-20 leaders, Michelle Obama was seen to take the unusual step of putting her hand briefly on the back of the Queen.

In a Fox News interview just after the trip to London, Trump called the Queen an \"incredible lady\" and said they had a lot of fun together. Some members of the British public and press were not amused, however, when Trump briefly walked in front of the Queen during a ceremonial inspection of the troops at Windsor Castle. The monarch had to do an awkward sidestep around him. Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images Joe Biden: Biden first met the Queen as a young senator in 1982. He returned nearly 40 years later, after his first G7 summit as President. They held private talks inside Windsor Castle, and Biden later said he wished he could have spoken to her longer. \"She was very generous,\" Biden said. He said he did not think she'd be insulted if he said she \"reminded me of my mother in terms of the look of her and the generosity.\" Chris Jackson/Getty Images All the Queen's presidents: From Truman to Biden Prev Next\n\nIt was the first time Elizabeth would encounter a sitting American president. Over her reign, she would meet 12 more, each man paying a degree of homage to the duty-bound woman whose very life charted a century of history.\n\nPerhaps no other person had met personally with so many American leaders or had witnessed at close range the upheavals of war, technology and politics that have defined the “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRemoved from the politics of transatlantic relations, yet still at the very center of British identity, the Queen provided American presidents a connection to their predecessors, a reminder of what a life devoted to public service looks like and a bit of uniquely royal glitz.\n\nMany emerged enchanted, spellbound or starstruck.\n\n“Whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you,” Truman told Elizabeth that day in 1951, “they immediately fall in love.”\n\nIt was a sentiment that would be repeated, in so many words, for the next 70 years, as American leaders visited her at her palaces in the United Kingdom or when she traveled to the White House.\n\n“She is truly one of my favorite people,” then-President Barack Obama said during a visit to London in 2016, after the Queen and her husband drove in their Land Rover to pick him up at Windsor Castle. “She’s an astonishing person, and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.”\n\nSome presidents, like Ronald Reagan, bonded with the Queen over horses and country life. Others, like Bill Clinton, found themselves impressed by her political aptitude.\n\nIn recent years, as she aged, presidents saw in her their own pasts. President Donald Trump said after meeting her, his Scottish-born mother would be proud. When he visited the Queen at Windsor last year, President Joe Biden said she reminded him of his own mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first state visit to Washington came in 1957, hosted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at an important moment for the new sovereign to represent her country with its most important ally.\n\nYet even Eisenhower, the commanding general of US forces in Europe during World War II, found himself humbled in the presence of the Queen.\n\n“There have been a few times in my life when I have wished that the gift of eloquence might have been conferred upon me,” he said during his toast at the state dinner. “This evening is one of those times.”\n\nAs it turned out, the Queen had a penchant for bringing out the relaxed side of the American leaders she encountered. After inviting Eisenhower to Balmoral, her estate in the Scottish Highlands where she died on Thursday, the Queen promised to provide him her recipe for scones. She followed up in a letter several months later.\n\n“Dear Mr. President,” she wrote in her scrawling, distinct hand. “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper, standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy arrived in London for a state visit in 1961, he and his glamorous wife Jacqueline were met with crowds of Britons lining the streets. The dinner was described as “pleasant,” though later there were rumors of tensions between the Queen and first lady over the guest list.\n\nKennedy, who was assassinated two years later, did not meet the Queen again. But when Britain dedicated a memorial to Kennedy in Surrey, around 20 miles outside London, the Queen paid tribute alongside Mrs. Kennedy and the slain President’s children.\n\nShe never met President Lyndon B. Johnson as his presidency became consumed by the war in Vietnam; he remained the only president she did not meet during her reign.\n\nThe Queen had already met Richard Nixon when he was serving as vice president, but met him again as president in 1969, when he paid a visit to the United Kingdom. Later, when the Queen’s children – Prince Charles and Princess Anne – visited the Nixon White House, observers thought the President seemed unusually interested, hiring bands and arranging a special ceremony.\n\nThere was even a hint of potential romance – though it didn’t pan out.\n\n“That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon,” Charles recounted in an interview with CNN in 2021.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was serving in office as the United States marked the 200th anniversary of American independence, a bicentennial that also marked its severance from Britain. Perhaps in a show of enduring US-UK ties, Ford hosted the Queen for a state dinner underneath a tent in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn a yellow chiffon gown and diamond tiara, the Queen was whisked around the dance floor by the President.\n\n“The Queen was easy to deal with,” then-first lady Betty Ford recounted in her memoir. “She was very definite about what she wanted and what she didn’t want. She loves Bob Hope and Telly Savalas, so we invited Bob Hope and Telly Savalas.”\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had a somewhat more mortifying experience during his visit to Buckingham Palace in 1977: He kissed the Queen Mother on her lips.\n\n“Nobody has done that since my husband died,” she exclaimed. Her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.\n\nNo president appeared more comfortable with the Queen than Ronald Reagan, who became the first American leader to spend the night at Windsor Castle in 1982. A shared love of horses – she the English rider; he the Western cowboy (at least in movies) – seemed to cement their relationship.\n\n“I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. He invited her the following year to his Rancho Del Cielo property in California, initially making plans for her to sail into Santa Barbara harbor on the royal yacht.\n\nA severe storm scuttled the maritime plans, forcing the Queen to arrive by airplane. At the ranch, Reagan wore a jean jacket and bolo tie to serve her and her husband a Tex-Mex lunch: enchiladas, chiles rellenos, refried beans, tacos, rice and guacamole.\n\nTheir friendship would stretch beyond Reagan’s presidency. In 1989, she granted Reagan honorary knighthood to recognize the US assistance during the Falkland Wars.\n\nWhen she came to Washington a few years later, President George H.W. Bush brought her to a Baltimore Orioles game and hosted her at the White House – where she ended up encountering another, future president.\n\nSpeaking with George W. Bush in 1991 about the new pair of boots he was wearing for her visit, the younger Bush revealed they’d been stamped with the words “God save the Queen.” That prompted her to ask if he was the black sheep of the family.\n\n“I guess so,” he acknowledged.\n\n“All families have them,” she replied.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton’s presidency, he met with the Queen during a tour of her palace and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But during a visit to London in 1997, he and his wife Hillary turned down the Queen’s invitation to tea, preferring instead to “be a tourist,” according to documents released by the UK’s National Archives last year.\n\n“The Americans said that the President and Mrs. Clinton were very grateful for HM The Queen’s invitation to tea at the Palace, but would wish to decline politely,” a note from Blair’s private secretary, Phillip Barton, revealed.\n\nStill, Clinton was impressed by the Queen’s unique abilities.\n\n“Her Majesty impressed me as someone who but for the circumstance of her birth, might have become a successful politician or diplomat. As it was, she had to be both, without quite seeming to be either,” he wrote in his memoir.\n\nMore than a decade after their chance initial meeting in his father’s White House, George W. Bush meet the queen several times, including when he became the first US president to be received with a state visit to Britain in 2003.\n\nHe would host Queen Elizabeth’s final visit to the White House in 2007; it was a symbolic nod to her first State Visit as queen 50 years earlier and marked the 400th anniversary of the English settlement of Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nDuring his welcoming remarks, he inadvertently suggested the Queen had also visited the White House in 1776 – adding 200 years to her age.\n\n“She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,” he said after winking in the monarch’s direction.\n\nThe aging queen would not return to the White House again but continued receiving American presidents in Britain. When Obama and his wife arrived in London in 2009, they came bearing an iPod loaded with footage of her previous visits to Washington, along with recordings of some of Obama’s speeches.\n\nEtiquette hawks were aghast when Michelle Obama placed her hand on the Queen, but the Queen herself did not seem to care. Speaking with aides after a dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama remarked she reminded him of his own grandmother.\n\n“She’s just like Toot, my grandmother. Courteous. Straightforward. All about what she thinks. She doesn’t suffer fools,” he said, according to a memoir by one of his aides.\n\nHis two predecessors also felt pangs of maternal memory when they encountered the queen in the final years of her life.\n\n“I was walking up and I was saying (to wife Melania): ‘Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle,’” Donald Trump told an interviewer afterward.\n\nTrump’s mother, born on the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, was enraptured by the Queen; Trump recalled her watching Elizabeth’s coronation on television. While his own visit to Windsor had awkward moments, like when he walked in front of the Queen as they were reviewing an honor guard, the Queen herself evinced no displeasure.\n\nWhen Biden visited the United Kingdom for a Group of 7 summit in 2021, the Queen made a surprise decision to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders, a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nWhen she hosted Biden later at Windsor Castle, she asked him about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nUnlike Trump or Obama, Biden is not an Anglophile. He’s a proud Irish American who has – sometimes jokingly – made references to the long British rule over his ancestors’ island.\n\nLast year also wasn’t his first time meeting the Queen; as a young senator, he’d received advice from his mother – an Irish American born with the surname Finnegan – ahead of a planned engagement with the monarch.\n\n“Don’t you bow down to her,” she told him in 1982, according to a memoir Biden published several years ago.\n\nWhen he met her last year, he did not bow. But he did remark on a familiar resemblance.\n\n“I don’t think she’ll be insulted,” he said, “but she reminded me of my mother.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/trevor-noah-white-house-correspondents-dinner-line/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Trevor Noah's most important line from the White House ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time in more than two years, official Washington gathered Saturday night for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.\n\nIt was, largely, a sedate affair – most notable for its normality.

Since the initial incursion into Ukraine, Putin has systematically shut down any dissenting voices in the media, leaving the Russian people in the dark about the true state of the war.\n\nWhile many people insist no such thing could ever happen in America, we have lived through a four-plus-year assault on the very notion of truth – culminating in the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, an insurrection fueled by misinformation about the 2020 election.\n\nThe peaceful transition of power between administrations, which has long stood at the center of American democracy, was fundamentally disrupted. Eight Republican senators and 139 Republican House members voted to object to the Electoral College results, despite an utter lack of evidence of any sort of widespread electoral fraud. Polls show a majority of Republican voters now believe that Biden would not have won if not for (nonexistent) fraud.\n\nWhat the January 6 insurrection should have taught all of us that democracy is tenuous. When we take our rights and freedoms for granted, we run the very real risk of losing them.\n\nThat Noah could feel comfortable ribbing the President of the United States – while he sat just a few feet away – speaks to the strength of our democracy. Dissenting voices are both heard and welcomed.\n\nWe would all do well to remember that – in hopes that what Noah said Saturday night is always true in this country.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/politics/gallery/2022-white-house-correspondents-dinner/index.html", "title": "Photos: The 2022 White House Correspondents' Dinner | CNN Politics", "text": "1.

The queen's eldest son, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\n\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nQueen laid to rest alongside husband, Prince Philip\n\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband and her parents.\n\nCharles and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George’s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\n\nIn contrast to the pomp and pageantry of her grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's internment was a “deeply personal family occasion.” They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip’s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George’s.\n\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George’s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\n\nElizabeth II’s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch’s younger sister who died in 2002.\n\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I. It is also the home of the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of chivalry founded by King Edward III in 1348.\n\nWestminster Abbey: See Queen Elizabeth at the iconic church where she was married, crowned, laid to rest\n\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\n\nWhen will King Charles' coronation take place?\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned, following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out for decades, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a pandemic.\n\nThe queen's funeral was expected to draw millions of viewers\n\nThe state funeral, expected to be the biggest gathering of world leaders in years, drew millions of people to the streets of London and likely billions more to their TVs and computer screens. The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\n\nLondon’s mayor’s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey. More than 10,000 police officers were on patrol in London with reinforcements supplied from all of Britain’s 43 police forces, authorities said.\n\nThe royal family:A look at the British royal family tree, spanning four generations\n\nRead more about what to expect from the reign of King Charles III: What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\n\nCelebrities pay their respects to the queen\n\nSome celebrities posted on social media to pay their respects to the late queen, while others attended Monday’s events to do the same.\n\nDavid Beckham, who waited in the queue like thousands of others to visit the queen’s coffin as it laid in state last week, posted a photo on Instagram.\n\n“Our Queen is home.. Today we said a final farewell to Her Majesty The Queen,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nSandra Oh attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey, posting several photos on Instagram, featuring the actress wearing mourning colors.\n\nAnd Elton John posted photos, too, remembering some moments he shared with the queen and noting she will be \"sorely missed.\"\n\n“My own memories of her are filled with joy and admiration,\" he wrote. The Queen honoured me with a CBE, a knighthood and the Companion of Honour. I was lucky enough to perform at three of her Jubilees. They were always joyous and humbling experiences. But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\n\nWhat is the committal service at Windsor Castle?\n\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral? How she manages to stay stoic\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss arrives at St George's chapel\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary attended the queen's state funeral. They were also among early arrivals to St George's chapel for the committal service.\n\nAt the state funeral, Truss read a prayer from Bible’s John 14: 1-9.\n\nPrincess Kate, daughter Princess Charlotte honor the queen with poignant accessories\n\nMother and daughter duo Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte, who attended the state funeral, both wore simple black dresses topped with black overcoats, paired with black tights and black shoes. But their jewelry choices paid tribute to a beloved matriarch.\n\nPrincess Charlotte wore a dainty brooch on her coat in the shape of a horseshoe, a tribute to the queen, her great-grandmother, who had a lifelong passion for horses. The queen often attended races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\n\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law. She wore Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection, People reported.\n\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\n\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\n\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin – accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family – was carried through the capital’s streets.\n\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle – where Elizabeth spent much of her time – for another procession before a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/entertainment/barbara-walters-death/index.html", "title": "Barbara Walters, legendary news anchor, has died at 93 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nBarbara Walters, the pioneering TV journalist whose interviewing skills made her one of the most prominent figures in broadcasting, has died, her spokesperson confirmed to CNN. She was 93.\n\n“Barbara Walters passed away peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones. She lived her life with no regrets. She was a trailblazer not only for female journalists but for all women,” Walters’ spokesperson Cindi Berger told CNN in a statement.\n\nWalters began her national broadcast career in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member for NBC’s “Today” show before being promoted to co-host in 1974. In 1976, Walters joined ABC News as the first female anchor on an evening news program.\n\nAt that network, Walters launched “The Barbara Walters Specials” and “10 Most Fascinating People” before becoming a co-host and correspondent for ABC News’ “20/20” in 1984. Along the way, she interviewed every US president and first lady since Richard and Pat Nixon.\n\nFor more than five decades, Walters was a name to reckon with, whether speaking with world leaders on news programs, in celebrities’ homes for her regular “Barbara Walters Specials” or on “The View,” a daytime talk show in which a diverse panel of women discuss the latest headlines.\n\nBarbara Walters sits on the set of NBC's \"Today\" show in New York on April 23, 1976. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nHer shows, some of which she produced, were some of the highest-rated of their type and spawned a number of imitators. Indeed, “The View” – which debuted in 1997 – paved the way for American talk shows “The Talk” and “The Chew,” as well as such entries as Britain’s “Loose Women” and Norway’s “Studio5.”\n\nWalters left “The View” in 2014, but remained a part-time contributor to ABC News for two years.\n\n“I knew it was time,” Walters told CNN’s Chris Cuomo at the time. “I like all the celebration, that’s great, but in my heart, I thought, ‘I want to walk away while I’m still doing good work.’ So I will.”\n\nLooking upon the numerous women who had looked up to her throughout her career, Walters said they were her legacy.\n\n“How do you say goodbye to something like 50 years in television?” she said in conclusion. “How proud when I see all the young women who are making and reporting the news. If I did anything to help make that happen, that is my legacy. From the bottom of my heart, to all of you with whom I have worked and who have watched and been by my side, I can say: ‘Thank you.’ “\n\nWalters was married four times, to business executive Robert Katz, producer Lee Guber and twice to entertainment mogul Merv Adelson. The second marriage to Adelson ended in 1992. She is survived by her daughter, Jackie, whom she and Guber adopted in 1968.\n\nWalters’ big ‘get’ interviews\n\nWalters was born September 25, 1929, in Boston. Her father, Lou, was a nightclub owner and theatrical impresario, and young Barbara grew up around celebrities – one reason she never appeared fazed by interviewing them.\n\nWalters earned her college degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1953.\n\nBarbara Walters is seen at a news conference on September 30, 1976, in New York. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nNotoriously competitive, Walters was dogged in her pursuit of big “get” interviews, so much so that there were long-standing reports of rivalry between her and another of ABC’s news stars, such as Diane Sawyer, who joined the network in 1989. That included, most recently, jockeying to land the first interview with Caitlyn Jenner, which Sawyer conducted in 2015.\n\nWalters, though, was no slacker in terms of landing major interviews, including presidents, world leaders and almost every imaginable celebrity, with a well-earned reputation for bringing her subjects to tears. Highlights included her 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky – which was watched by an average of 48.5 million viewers – and a historic 1977 joint sit-down with Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Menachem Begin.\n\nWalter’s first job on air was on NBC’s “Today” show in the 1960s, where she reported what were then perceived as “women’s stories.” In 1974, she was officially named co-anchor of the show. Two years later she became, for a time, the best-known person in television when she left “Today” to join ABC as the first woman to co-anchor a network evening newscast, signing for a then-startling $1 million a year.\n\nThough her term in that position was short-lived – co-anchor Harry Reasoner never warmed to her – she had the last laugh, staying at the network for almost four decades and co-hosting the magazine show “20/20” (with her old “Today” colleague, Hugh Downs), “The View” and countless specials.\n\nShe was both mercilessly parodied – on the early “Saturday Night Live,” Gilda Radner mocked her as the sometimes mush-mouthed “BabaWawa” – and richly honored, with multiple Emmys, a Peabody and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nSometimes seen as brash, usually by men questioning her forthright demeanor, she could only shrug at the criticism.\n\n“If it’s a woman, it’s caustic; if it’s a man, it’s authoritative. If it’s a woman it’s too pushy, if it’s a man it’s aggressive in the best sense of the word,” she once observed.", "authors": ["Todd Leopold Emma Tucker Jamiel Lynch", "Todd Leopold", "Emma Tucker", "Jamiel Lynch"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/08/donald-trump-ted-cruz-dinner-white-house-lee-harvey-oswald-jfk/98916260/", "title": "Trump breaks bread with former foe Ted Cruz", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — It's not every day the president dines with a man whose father he once suggested was involved in the JFK assassination — or that a man dines with a president who once referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz, together again.\n\nThe president hosts a White House dinner Wednesday for the Texas senator, his wife Heidi, and their two daughters, Trump's latest effort to reach out to some of his critics, including those who opposed him in the 2016 Republican primaries.\n\nWhile Trump called Cruz \"Lyin' Ted\" during the campaign — and Cruz responded by describing the future president as a \"pathological liar\" — both made the right noises ahead of their White House bread breaking.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for our families to visit together and to spend some relaxed time in the residence,\" Cruz told reporters.\n\nThere are no apologies on the menu, officials said.\n\n\"This is a president who is going to engage with everybody who can help join in proposing ideas and thoughts and opinions on how to move the country forward,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \"So, he looks forward to dinner tonight with Senator and Mrs. Cruz, as he has with several others.\"\n\nSince moving into the White House on Jan. 20, Trump has had dinners and meetings with a number of past critics, including primary rivals Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Other GOP election opponents, Ben Carson and Rick Perry, found their way into Trump's Cabinet.\n\nThe GOP race between Trump and Cruz turned particularly nasty, however.\n\nAt one point, Trump poked at Heidi Cruz's looks, tweeting out an unflattering picture of her next to a glamour shot of Melania Trump, a former professional model. Then there was the JFK incident: In a television interview, Trump referenced a tabloid report that somehow tried to link Cruz's father to presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nCruz, meanwhile, accused Trump of planting tabloid stories alleging marital infidelity. Having denounced Trump as \"utterly amoral,\" Cruz pointedly refused to endorse the nominee during a speech at the Republican convention.

And like so many before her – and after – she was proudly American.” He also recalled his experience working with Albright in the 1990s when he was a senator.\n\n“As the world redefined itself in the wake of the Cold War,” Biden wrote, “we were partners and friends working to welcome newly liberated democracies into NATO and confront the horrors of genocide in the Balkans.”\n\nAlbright was a central figure in former President Bill Clinton’s administration, first serving as his US ambassador to the United Nations before he picked her in his second term to be the first female secretary of state. In office, she championed the expansion of NATO, pushed for the alliance to intervene in the Balkans to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing, sought to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, and championed human rights and democracy across the globe.\n\nClinton on Wednesday similarly remembered his former top diplomat as “a passionate force for freedom, democracy, and human rights” whose death “is an immense loss to the world in a time when we need the lessons of her life the most.”\n\nUS President Bill Clinton (left) and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talk together in the White House's Oval Office, Washington DC, September 8, 1997.

And that’s all she wanted to talk about. She was happy. She was upbeat,” he added. “And she didn’t want to venture into her health challenges. She said, ‘I’m being treated, I’m doing the best I can. The main thing we can all do now is to think about the world we want to leave for our kids.’”\n\nWhen Clinton nominated Albright to be his second secretary of state in 1996, he said the then-UN ambassador “embodies the best of America” and displays “determination to advance our interests around the world.”\n\n“It says something about our country, and about our new secretary of state designate, that a young girl raised in the shadow of Nazi aggression in Czechoslovakia can rise to the highest diplomatic office in America,” he said at the time.\n\n‘An American giant’\n\nMadeleine Albright, seen here in 1997, was the first woman to serve as US secretary of state.

Having seen America at its best, she pushed relentlessly for us to live up to our role as a moral beacon and defender of freedom,” Blinken said. “After leaving the State Department, when asked if she was relieved not to be dealing with crises around the world, she’d say simply, ‘I miss it every day.’ She loved this country. She loved this department.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nScott Jennings: DeSantis shows he can do what Trump can’t\n\nScott Jennings courtesy of Scott Jennings\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent a clear message to every Republican voter Tuesday night: My way is the path to a national majority, and former President Donald Trump’s way is the path to future disappointments and continued suffering.\n\nFour years ago, DeSantis won his first gubernatorial race by less than a percentage point. His nearly 20-point win against Democratic candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday sent the message that DeSantis, not Trump, can win over the independent voters who decide elections.\n\nDeSantis’ decisive victory offers a future where the Republican Party might actually win the popular vote in a presidential contest – something that hasn’t been done since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the candidates Trump endorsed in 2022 struggled, and it was clear from CNN exit polls that the former President – with his 37% favorability rating – would be a serious underdog in the 2024 general election should he win the Republican presidential nomination for a third time.\n\nMy friend Patrick Ruffini of Echelon Insights tweeted a key observation: DeSantis commanded huge support among Latinos in 2022 compared to Trump in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won the heavily Latino Miami-Dade County by seven points. DeSantis flipped the county on Tuesday and ran away with an 11-point win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Osceola County by nearly 14 points. This time, DeSantis secured the county by nearly seven points, marking a whopping 21-point swing.\n\nDeSantis combined his strength among Latinos with his support among working class Whites, suburban white-collar voters and rural Floridians. That’s a coalition that could win nationally, unlike Trump’s limited appeal among several traditional Republican voting segments.\n\nLast year, it was Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia who scored an earthquake in a Biden state by keeping Trump at arm’s length and focusing on the issues. Tonight, it was DeSantis who ran as his own man (Trump rallied for Marco Rubio but not DeSantis at the end of the campaign) and showed what you can do when you combine the political instincts required to be a successful Republican these days with actual governing competence.\n\nDeSantis made a convincing case that he, rather than Trump, gives Republicans the best chance to defeat Biden (or some other Democrat) in 2024. With Trump plotting a reelection campaign announcement soon, DeSantis has a lot to think about and a solid springboard from which to launch a challenge to the former President.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W.

If election night confirmed anything for me it is this: We can all – voters, doomscrollers, pundits and election deniers included – stop believing every election revolves around former President Donald Trump. Instead, when asked in exit polls across the country, younger people, women and other voters in key demographics said their top concerns were inflation, abortion rights, crime and other quality of life issues.\n\nWhat a relief. It finally feels like a majority of voters want to re-center American politics away from the toxic, conspiracy theory-driven rhetoric we’ve experienced over the past several years.\n\nYes, Republicans are still projected to take control of the House of Representatives, with a narrow (and narrowing) majority – but will that make much difference? Despite the advantage Democrats had in the chamber the past two years, President Joe Biden has still had to battle and compromise to get parts of his agenda passed. How the balance of power will settle in the Senate is unclear, with a few races in key states still undecided as of this afternoon. It will likely hinge, again, on Georgia, and a forthcoming runoff election between the incumbent, Democrat Raphael Warnock, and his GOP challenger, former football star Herschel Walker.\n\nNo matter what party you claim, there were positive signs coming out of the midterms. My hometown, Philadelphia, and its surrounding suburbs, came up big in another election – rejecting the Trump-backed New Jersey transplant, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and helping to send Democratic candidate John Fetterman to the US Senate. Pennsylvania voters also rejected an election denier, Doug Mastriano, in the race for state governor, and made history by electing Democrat Summer Lee as the state’s first Black woman to serve in Congress.\n\nMaryland voters, meanwhile, elected Democrat Wes Moore as their state’s first Black governor. And in New England, Maura Healey became Massachusetts’ first female governor. She’s also the first out lesbian to win a state governorship anywhere in the US.\n\nDemocracy, freedom and equality also won out on ballot issues.\n\nIn unfinished business, voters tackled slavery, permanently abolishing “involuntary servitude” in four states – Vermont, Oregon, Alabama and Tennessee. (Louisiana held on to the slavery clause under its constitution, however.)\n\nDespite efforts to limit voting rights across the nation, voters in Alabama approved a measure requiring that any change to state election law goes into effect at least six months before a general election. And, in Kentucky, voters narrowly beat back an amendment that would have removed constitutional protections for abortion rights – one of several instances in which voters refused to accept restrictive reproductive rights measures.\n\nStill, the highlight of my midterms night was watching 25-year-old Maxwell Frost win a US congressional race in Florida – holding a Democratic seat in a state whose 2022 results skewed red, no less. More and more, we are seeing young people energized, voting and stepping up with fresh ideas to lead this democracy.

Despite his efforts, many of his favorites not only lost but denied the GOP the usual out-party wave of wins that come in midterm elections. This leaves a diminished Trump with the challenge of deciding what to do next.\n\nIn the short term, the man who so often returns to his well-worn playbook resumed his years-long effort to ruin Americans’ confidence in any election his team loses. “Protest, protest, protest,” he told his followers, even before all the polls closed. In a sign of his declining power, no mass protests ensued.\n\nNevertheless, false claims of election fraud will likely be a major theme if he follows through on his loudly voiced hints that he plans to run for the White House again in 2024.\n\nTo run or not to run is now the main question. It’s not an easy choice. Trump could end up like other one-term presidents he has mocked, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, who retreated from politics and devoted themselves to new interests. However, he has other options. He could revive his television career – Fox News? – or return to his businesses. Or, he could develop a new role as leader of an organization that can exploit his prodigious fundraising ability, and give him a platform for grabbing attention, while leaving him plenty of time for golf.\n\nRunning could forestall the various legal problems he faces, but he has lawyers who might accomplish the same goal. Fox News is unlikely to pay enough, and his businesses are now being watched by a court-appointed overseer. This leaves him with a combination of easy work – fundraising and pontificating – combined with his favorite pastimes: fame, money and fun. What’s not to like?\n\nMichael D’Antonio is the author of the book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book “High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.”\n\nDavid Gergen: A sigh of relief for Americans\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nFor many Americans deeply worried about the future of our democracy, Tuesday’s elections brought a glimmer of hope. Instead of chaos, we had an orderly process of voting. So far, the streets have been free of violence, the courts are not clogged with petitions to overthrow the results and many election deniers have been cast aside. Overall, this was an election that rejected the extremists and rallied the friends of democracy. Whatever your political leanings, that is very good news.\n\nIt was especially encouraging to see voters of younger generations turn out in droves. John Della Volpe, the pollster for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, told me that this was the third straight national election – 2018, 2020 and now 2022 – in which the youth vote has surged. And their votes mattered: Drawing upon exit polls, Volpe estimates that voters over 40 were likely to vote for Republican candidates while voters under 40 went for Democrats – and those under 40 were the determining factor.\n\nIt was also inspiring that a number of newcomers to the political arena did so well in pledging to work with others across the aisle. There is no better example than Wes Moore, who was elected the first Black governor of Maryland. Moore had never run for office before, but he had a compelling background – a combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne, a powerful leader in the nonprofit world and far more – and he spoke with a humility that appealed.\n\nThis was also an election, of course, that will go down in history as a huge surprise. Give credit where it is due – President Joe Biden pulled it off even though his approval ratings were fairly abysmal. Now the question is whether he can translate his success (and that of other Democrats) into greater progress in governing. Knowing how recalcitrant his opponents can be, he was smart to reach out to Republican leaders within hours.\n\nBottom line: Tough days still lie ahead, but for one of the first times in recent memory, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief that there are still people in the public arena hungry to bring us together again.\n\nDavid Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN.

Gov. Hochul now has to deliver\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy of Jill Filipovic\n\nDemocrat Kathy Hochul won the New York State gubernatorial race, and thank goodness. Her opponent, Lee Zeldin, is not your typical moderate Republican who usually stands a chance in a blue state. Instead, he’s an abortion opponent who wanted voters to simply trust he wouldn’t mess with New York’s abortion laws.\n\nZeldin was endorsed by the National Rifle Association when he was in Congress. He is a Trump acolyte who voted against certifying the 2020 election in Congress, after texting with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and reportedly planning to contest the outcome of the 2020 election before the results were even in.\n\nNew Yorkers sent a definitive message: Our values matter, even in moments of profound uncertainty.\n\nPlus, Hochul made history as the first woman elected to the governor’s office in New York.\n\nThis race was, in its final days, predicted to be closer than it actually was. Part of that was simply the usual electoral math: The minority party typically has an advantage in the midterms, and Republicans are a minority in Washington, DC, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress. And polling in New York state didn’t look as good for Hochul as it should have in a solidly blue state: Voters who talked to pollsters emphasized crime fears and the economy; abortion rights were galvanizing, but didn’t seem as definitive in an election for a governor vastly unlikely to have an abortion criminalization bill delivered to her desk.\n\nThe polls were imperfect. It turns out that New Yorkers are, in fact, New Yorkers: Not cowed by overblown claims of crime (while I think crime is indeed a problem Democrats should address, New York City remains one of the safest places in the country); determined to defend the racial, ethnic and sexual diversity that makes our state great; and committed to standing up against the tyranny of an anti-democratic party that would force women into pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nHowever, Democrats shouldn’t take this win for granted. The issues voters raised – inflation, crime – are real concerns. And the reasons many voters turned out – abortion rights, democratic norms – remain under threat.\n\nHochul’s job now is to address voter concerns, while standing up for New York values: Openness, decency, freedom for all. Because that’s what New Yorkers did today: The majority of us didn’t cast our ballots from a place of fear and reaction, but from the last dregs of hope and optimism. We voted for what we want. And we now want our governor to deliver.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nDouglas Heye: In North Carolina, the issue of crime loomed large\n\nDouglas Heye Jeremy Freeman\n\nNorth Carolina’s Senate race received less attention than contests in some other states – possibly a result of the campaign having lesser-known candidates than states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nIn the waning weeks of the race, multiple polls had the candidates – Democratic former state Supreme Court chief justice Cheri Beasley and Republican US House Rep. Ted Budd – separated by a percentage point or less.\n\nPerhaps more than in any other Senate campaign, the issue of crime loomed large in North Carolina, with Budd claiming in his speeches that it had become much more dangerous to walk the streets in the state. That talking point, along with his focus on inflation, appeared to help propel him to victory in Tuesday’s vote.\n\nBeasley, by contrast, focused much of her attention on abortion, making it a central plank of her campaign that she would stand up not just for women’s reproductive rights, but workplace protections and equal pay.\n\nThe two candidates were vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Despite being seen as a red state – albeit that is less solidly Republican than neighboring southern states – North Carolina has elected Democrats as five of the last six governors and two of the last six senators.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama won the state in 2008 but lost it in 2012 by one of the closest margins in the nation. And while Donald Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020, he never received 50% of the vote.\n\nDouglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator.

Nelson\n\nMany of us suspected that Democratic Florida Congresswoman and former House impeachment manager Val Demings would have an uphill battle unseating incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, and weren’t entirely surprised when she lost the race. With 98% of the vote counted, Rubio won easily, garnering 57.8% of the vote to Demings’ 41.1%.\n\nAs it turns out, Tuesday was a tough night all around for Black women running statewide. Beyond Demings’ loss, Judge Cheri Beasley narrowly lost her Senate bid in North Carolina.\n\nAnd in the big heartbreak of the night, Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race to Gov. Brian Kemp – a repeat of her defeat to him four years ago, when the two tangled for what at the time was an open seat.\n\nAbrams shook up the 2018 race by expanding the electoral map, enlisting more women and people of color who turned out in record numbers – but she fell short of punching her ticket to Georgia’s governor’s mansion. And on Tuesday she lost to Kemp by a much wider margin than in 2018.\n\nHad Abrams succeeded, she would have been the first Black woman to become the governor of a US state. After her second straight electoral loss, America is still waiting for that breakthrough.\n\nMeanwhile, an ever bigger winner of the night was Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, who handily defeated Democrat Charlie Crist.\n\nDeSantis’ big night solidifies what some feel is a compelling claim to front-runner status for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, on what turned out to be a strong election night for Republicans in the state.\n\nIt’s hard for a Democrat to win statewide in the deep South. And as Demings, Beasley and Abrams have shown, it’s particularly tough for a Black woman to win statewide in the region: In fact, it’s never been done.\n\nAll three women were well-qualified and well-funded stars in their party. But, when we look at the final vote tallies, it tells a familiar story. Take Demings, for example, a former law enforcement officer – she was Orlando’s police chief – and yet, she did not get the big law enforcement endorsements. Rubio did, although he never wore the blue.\n\nThat was a big red flag for me, and it showed how much gender and race still play in the minds of male voters and power brokers of my generation and older. For Black women, a double burden of both race and gender at play. It is the nagging story of our lives.\n\nAs for Abrams, I think Kemp was helped by backing away from Trump and modulating his campaign message to appeal to suburban women and independents.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, just didn’t have the same support and enthusiasm this time around for her candidacy. And that is unfortunate, but for her to lose by such a big margin says much more.\n\nAt the end of the day however, these three women have nothing to regret. They ran great campaigns, and they created great future platforms for themselves. And they each put one more crack in the glass ceiling facing candidates for the US Senate and governors’ mansions.\n\nSophia A.

Still, as a longtime Pennsylvania election-watcher, I see three clear takeaways:\n\n1) Pennsylvanians don’t take to extreme anti-establishment candidates. The GOP candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano, broke the mold of just about any statewide candidate in the last few decades.\n\nThe state that delivered wins to center-right and center-left candidates like my father Gov, Dick Thornburgh, Sen. Bob Casey and Gov, Tom Ridge gave establishment Democrat Josh Shapiro a wipeout double-digit victory.\n\n2) “You’re not from here and I am” and “Stick it to the man” proved to be sufficiently powerful messages for alt-Democrat John Fetterman to win his Senate race, albeit by a much smaller margin.\n\nAmplified by more than $300 million in campaign spending (making PA’s the most expensive Senate race in the country), those two simple themes spoke to the quirky, stubborn authenticity that is a longstanding strand of Pennsylvania’s political DNA.\n\n3) In the home of Independence Hall, independent voters made a significant difference. Pretty much every poll since the beginning of both marquee races showed the two party candidates with locked in lopsided mirror-image margins among members of their own party.\n\nOver 90% of Democrats said they’d vote for Shapiro or Fetterman and close to 90% of Republicans said the same of Mastriano or Oz. The 20 to 30% of PA voters who consider themselves independent voters may have been more decisive than most tea-leaves readers gave them credit for.\n\nMost polls showed Shapiro and Fetterman with whopping leads among independent voters. They may not have been the same independent voters: Shapiro’s indy supporters could be former GOP voters disaffected by Trump, and Fetterman’s indy squad could be young voters mobilized by the abortion rights issue (about half of young voters are independents nationally).\n\nThe growing significance of this independent vote in close elections may increase pressure on both parties to repeal closed primaries so that indy voters can vote in those elections. Both parties will want to have more time and opportunity to court them in the future.\n\nWith Florida ripening to a deeper and deeper Red, Pennsylvania may loom larger and larger as the most contested, consequential swing state in the country: well-worth watching as we move inexorably to 2024.\n\nDavid Thornburgh is a longtime Pennsylvania civic leader.

There was a palpable sense of excitement and urgency around the election on campus. For many young people, especially young women, there was one motivating issue that drove their participation: abortion rights.\n\nOne of the most important and contentious issues on the ballot in Michigan was Proposal 3 (commonly known as Prop 3), which codifies the right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms, such as birth control, into the Michigan state constitution. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Michiganders have feared the return of a 1931 law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, and contains felony criminal penalties for abortion providers.\n\nThough the courts have prevented that old law from taking effect, voters were eager to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution, and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 3 with over 55% of voters approving the proposal. This is a major feat given the coordinated campaign against the proposal. Both pro-life groups and the Catholic Church strongly opposed it, and many ads claimed it was “too confusing and too extreme.”\n\nThe issue of abortion was a major focal point of the gubernatorial campaign between Gov, Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon. Pro-Whitmer groups consistently highlighted Dixon’s support of a near-total abortion ban and her past comments that having a rapist’s baby could help a victim heal. Whitmer’s resounding win in the purple state of Michigan is certainly due, in part, to backlash against Dixon’s extreme positions on the issue.\n\nAfter the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, so many young voters felt helpless and despondent about the future of abortion rights. However, instead of throwing in the towel, Michigan voters showed up and displayed their support for Whitmer and Prop 3, showing that Michiganders support bodily autonomy and the right to choose.\n\nIsabelle Schindler is a senior at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy.

Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, whose campaign received $3.75 million from Nike founder Phil Knight, conceded early Tuesday night, having garnered 9% of the vote – a clear rejection of the idea that big donors can buy elections.\n\nAs Kotek takes the baton from Democrat Kate Brown, the least-popular governor in the country, she’ll confront a rising tide of homelessness in Portland. Along with drug use and violent crime, homelessness tops concerns of the city’s voters, and Kotek brings to Salem a legislative track-record of tackling the issue head on.\n\nKotek’s victory indicates that Oregonians remain concerned about issues Democrats focus on, with voters this cycle passing one of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. The electorate also overwhelmingly approved a measure amending the state constitution to penalize lawmakers who walk out of legislative sessions in order to stymie bill passage, a strategy the Republican caucus deployed in 2019 and 2020 in opposition to vaccine, gun regulation and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bills.\n\nAnd, in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights loomed large in this gubernatorial election, with Kotek vowing to enshrine legal protections for Oregon abortion providers and to establish a fund to increase access to reproductive health care. Against a sea of Republican-led anti-LGBTQ initiatives across the country, Kotek also makes history as one of the first two openly-lesbian governors (Maura Healey, who won the governor’s race in Massachusetts, is the other).\n\nWhen she entered the race, Drazan declared this would be “a Republican year” in Oregon and across the nation. The “red wave” Republicans hoped for failed to materialize, but they came shockingly close to taking the governorship in a Democratic stronghold. Voters have signaled that while they’re staying blue for now, the state has serious problems – and they expect Democrats to step up and get results.\n\nLindsey Mantoan, an Oregon resident, is an associate professor of theater and resident dramaturg at Linfield University.

In the end, it wasn’t – with author and political newcomer J.D. Vance defeating Rep. Tim Ryan by over six percentage points.\n\nRepublicans also swept every statewide office in Ohio, including the elections for justices on the Ohio Supreme Court who, for the first time, had their political party listed next to their names on the ballot. This will give the Republicans a dependable majority on state’s highest court, which is significant since there is an ongoing unresolved legal battle over the drawing of state and federal legislative districts.\n\nIt is now safe to say that Ohio, for so long the quintessential swing state, is a Republican state. What happened is simple to explain: White, working-class voters have become a solid part of the Republican coalition in the Buckeye State. In 2016, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump convinced these voters that the Democratic Party had abandoned them to progressive and internationalist interests with values they did not share. This shift was symbolized by the movement of voters in the former manufacturing hub of Northeast Ohio, once the most Democratic part of the state, to the GOP.\n\nThe question going into 2022 was whether the Republicans could keep these voters if Trump was not on the ballot. The Democrats recruited Rep. Tim Ryan to run for the Senate because he was from Northeast Ohio, having grown up just north of Youngstown. They hoped that he could win those working-class voters back, and Ryan designed his campaign around working-class economic interests, distancing himself from Washington, DC, Democrats and even opposing President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. Once the votes were counted, however, Ryan performed only slightly better than Biden had in Northeast Ohio. In fact, he even lost Trumbull County, the place where he grew up and whose voters he represented in Washington for two decades.\n\nOhio Democrats will face another test in two years, when the Democratic Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown will be on the ballot. Brown won in 2018, but given last night’s result, the Republicans will have no problem recruiting a quality candidate to run for a seat that, right now, at least leans Republican.\n\nPaul Sracic is a professor of politics and international relations at Youngstown State University and the coauthor of “Ohio Politics and Government” (Congressional Quarterly Press, 2015).

Davis Courtesy Dan Gleiter\n\nPennsylvanians clearly rejected the worst of right-wing extremism on Nov. 8, sending a strong message to former President Donald Trump that his endorsement doesn’t guarantee victory in the Keystone State.\n\nTrump proved to be a two-time loser in the commonwealth this election cycle, despite stirring up his base with screaming rallies for Republican candidates Dr. Mehmet Oz, Doug Mastriano and Rep. Scott Perry.\n\nAnd a lot of people are breathing a long, hard sign of relief.\n\nMastriano, who CNN projects will lose the race for the state’s governor to Democrat Josh Shapiro, scared many Pennsylvanians with his brash, take-no-prisoners Trump swagger. He inflamed racial tensions, embraced Christian nationalism, and once said women who violated his proposed abortion ban should be charged with murder. On top of all that, he’s an unapologetic election denier.\n\nDr. Oz, meanwhile, couldn’t shake his carpetbagger baggage, and Oprah’s rejection – on November 4, she endorsed his rival and now-victorious candidate in the Senate race, John Fetterman – seems to have carried more weight than Trump’s rallies, at least in the feedback I’ve received from readers and community members.\n\nAll of this should compel some serious soul-searching among Republican leadership in Pennsylvania. What could have they been thinking to place all their marbles on someone so outside of the mainstream as Mastriano? Did they think Pennsylvanians wouldn’t check Oz’s address? Will they rethink their hardline stance on abortion?\n\nIn a widely-watched House race, Harrisburg City Councilwoman Shamaine Daniels made a valiant Democratic effort to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Perry, after the party’s preferred candidate pulled out of the race. But her lack of name recognition and inexperience on the state or national stage impacted her ability to establish a base of her own. So the five-term incumbent, who played a role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, will return to Washington – though perhaps with a clipped wing.\n\nMany Pennsylvanians may be staunch conservatives, but we proved we’re not extremists – and we won’t embrace Trump or his candidates if they threaten the very foundations of democracy.\n\nJoyce M.

Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock, all Democrats, won in the Peach State. There has been a raging debate in Georgia political circles since then as to whether these races signal a long-term left turn toward the Democratic Party, caused by shifting demographics, or whether they were merely a negative reaction to former President Donald Trump. Tuesday’s results point strongly to the latter.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp, who had rebuffed Trump’s demand to overturn the 2020 presidential result, cruised to a convincing reelection on Tuesday with a pro-growth message by defeating the Democrats’ rising star Stacey Abrams by some 300,000 votes. His coattails also propelled other Republican state candidates to victory – including the Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who had also defied the former President – and helped to keep the Georgia General Assembly firmly in GOP hands.\n\nHowever, before sliding Georgia from a purple political state back into the solid red state column, we still have one more contest to look forward to: a runoff for the US Senate, echoing what happened in Georgia’s last set of Senate races.\n\nGeorgia requires candidates to win over 50% of the vote and the presence of a Libertarian on the ticket has thrown the heated race between Warnock, the incumbent senator and senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Georgia football great Herschel Walker into an overtime runoff campaign to be decided on December 6.\n\nBoth Walker and Warnock survived November 8 to fight another day despite different strong headwinds facing each of them. For Warnock, it has been Biden’s low favorability rating – hovering around 40% nationwide, and only 38% in Georgia, according to Marist. For Walker, it has been the steady drumbeat of personal allegations rolled out over the past few months, some admitted to and others staunchly denied.\n\nWarnock has faced his challenge by emphasizing his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues and occasionally disagreeing with the President on others. Walker, who is backed by Trump, has pulled from the deep well of admiration many Georgians feel for the former college football star.\n\nBoth of these strategies were strong enough to get them into a runoff, but which strategy will work in that arena? The answer could be crucial to determining which party controls the US Senate, depending on the result of other races that have yet to be called. Stay tuned while Georgians enjoy having the two candidates for Thanksgiving dinner and into the holiday season.\n\nEdward Lindsey is a former Republican member of the Georgia House of Representatives and its majority whip.

Mack Donnell Harmon\n\nIn his bid to win a seat in the US Senate, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to appeal to working class voters who felt abandoned by establishment Democrats. Those blue collar voters – many of them formerly members of his party – overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for Ryan, his strategy failed. He lost to J.D. Vance by a decisive margin, according to election projections.\n\nIt was, perhaps, a predictable ending for a candidate who threw away the traditional approach of rallying your base and instead courted the almost non-existent, moderate Trump voter. And it’s a shame. Had Ryan won, Ohio would have had two Democratic senators. The last time that happened was almost 30 years ago, when Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn represented our state.\n\nBut in wooing Republicans and right-leaning moderates, Ryan abandoned many of Ohio’s left-leaning Democrats who brought him to the dance.\n\nThat approach was perhaps most evident in his ads. In a campaign spot in which he is shown tossing a football at various computer screens showing messages he disapproves of, he hurls the ball at one emblazoned with the words “Defund the Police” and dismisses what he disdainfully calls “the culture wars.”\n\nAnother ad showed Ryan, gun in hand, hitting his mark at target practice, as the words “Not too bad for a Democrat” appear on the screen. To imply you’re pro-gun rights when majority of Americans support gun control legislation – and when your party explicitly embraces a pro-gun control stance is bewildering. Ryan’s ads on the economy began to parrot the anti-China rhetoric taken up by Republicans. And when President Joe Biden announced his student debt plan in an effort to invigorate the Democratic bringing economic relief to millions of millennial voters, Ryan opposed the move.\n\nAs a Black woman living in a metropolitan area, I would have liked to see him reach out to communities of color, perhaps by making an appearance with African American members of Ohio’s congressional delegation Rep. Joyce Beatty or Rep. Shontel Brown. But I would have settled for one ad addressing the economic or social concerns of people who don’t live in the Rust Belt.\n\nRyan might have won if he’d gotten the kind of robust backing from his own party that Vance got from his – and if he’d courted his Democratic base.\n\nBrianna N.

Tony Evers surviving a challenge from businessman Tim Michels and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson barely holding off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.\n\nIn late February, Johnson, who Democrats hoped might be a beatable incumbent, was viewed favorably by only 33% of Wisconsin’s voters, according to the Marquette University Law School poll. He was viewed unfavorably by 45% of the electorate with 21% saying they didn’t know what to think of him or hadn’t heard enough about him. He finished the election cycle still seen unfavorably by 46% with 43% of the voters holding a favorable view of him.\n\nHowever, Democrats decided to run possibly the worst candidate if they wanted to win against Johnson. At one point in August, the relatively unknown Barnes actually led Johnson by 7%. But familiarity with Barnes didn’t help him. Crime was the third most concerning issue for Wisconsin voters this election cycle, according to the Marquette University Law School poll, and Johnson’s campaign successfully attacked Barnes for statements in support of decreasing or redirecting police funding and for reducing the prison population. In the end, Johnson came out victorious.\n\nSo, with Republicans winning in the Senate, what saved Evers in the gubernatorial race? Perhaps it was women voters.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade meant Wisconsin’s abortion ban from 1849 went back into effect. Michels supported the no-exceptions law but then flip-flopped and said he could support exceptions for rape and incest. Johnson, for his part, successfully deflected the issue by saying he wanted Wisconsin’s abortion law to go to referendum.\n\nAnother issue that may have soured women voters on Michels was the allegation of a culture of sexual harassment within his company. Evers’ campaign unsurprisingly jumped at the opportunity to argue that “the culture comes from the top.” (In response to the allegations against his company, Michel said: “These unproven allegations do not reflect the training and culture at Michels Corporation. Harassment in the workplace should not be condoned, nor tolerated, nor was it under Michels Corporation leadership.”) Michels’ divisive primary fight against former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also didn’t help his appeal to women voters, especially in Kleefisch’s home county of Waukesha, formerly a key to a Republican victory in Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republicans are going to win in 2024, they need to figure out how to attract the support of suburban women.\n\nJames Wigderson is the former editor of RightWisconsin.com, a conservative-leaning news website, and the author of a twice-weekly newsletter, “Life, Under Construction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/madeleine-albright-obituary/index.html", "title": "Madeleine Albright, first female US secretary of state, dies | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMadeleine Albright, the first female US secretary of state and who helped steer Western foreign policy in the aftermath of the Cold War, has died. She was 84 years old.\n\nThe cause was cancer, Albright’s family said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAlbright was a central figure in President Bill Clinton’s administration, first serving as US ambassador to the United Nations before becoming the nation’s top diplomat in his second term. She championed the expansion of NATO, pushed for the alliance to intervene in the Balkans to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing, sought to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, and championed human rights and democracy across the globe.\n\nBelow is a statement from the family of @Madeleine: pic.twitter.com/C7Xt0EN5c9 — Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) March 23, 2022\n\nPresident Joe Biden paid tribute to Albright in a lengthy statement Wednesday, calling her a “force” and saying working with her during the 1990s while he was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was among the highlights of his Senate career.\n\n“When I think of Madeleine, I will always remember her fervent faith that ‘America is the indispensable nation,’” said Biden, who ordered flags at the White House and all federal buildings to be flown at half-staff in Albright’s honor.\n\n“Few leaders have been so perfectly suited for the times in which they served,” Clinton said in a statement. “As a child in war-torn Europe, Madeleine and her family were twice forced to flee their home. When the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era of global interdependence, she became America’s voice at the UN, then took the helm at the State Department, where she was a passionate force for freedom, democracy, and human rights.”\n\nClinton later told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he had recently spoken with his former top diplomat.\n\nShe “spent the entire conversation talking about how Ukraine had to be defended and that we had put a lot of those who said we had made a mistake to expand NATO – she said (Russia’s) not going after NATO yet,” Clinton said on “The Situation Room.”\n\n“She just wanted to support whatever we could do to back Ukraine. And that’s all she wanted to talk about. She was happy. She was upbeat,” he added. “And she didn’t want to venture into her health challenges. She said, ‘I’m being treated, I’m doing the best I can. The main thing we can all do now is to think about the world we want to leave for our kids.’”\n\nAlbright was a face of US foreign policy in the decade between the end of the Cold War and the war on terror triggered by the September 11, 2001, attacks, an era heralded by President George H.W. Bush as a “new world order.” The US, particularly in Iraq and the Balkans, built international coalitions and occasionally intervened militarily to roll back autocratic regimes, and Albright – a self-identified “pragmatic idealist” who coined the term “assertive multilateralism” to describe the Clinton administration’s foreign policy – drew from her experience growing up in a family that fled the Nazis and communists in mid-20th century Europe to shape her worldview.\n\nShe saw the US as the “indispensable nation” when it came to using diplomacy backed by the use of force to defend democratic values around the world.\n\n“We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us,” she told NBC in 1998. “I know that the American men and women in uniform are always prepared to sacrifice for freedom, democracy and the American way of life.”\n\nPerhaps most notable were her efforts to bring about an end to violence in the Balkans, and she was crucial in pushing Clinton to intervene in Kosovo in 1999 to prevent a genocide against ethnic Muslims by former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. She was haunted by the earlier failure of the Clinton administration to end the genocide in Bosnia.\n\nThe breakup of communist Yugoslavia into several independent states, including Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia, in the 1990s generated savage bloodshed unseen on the continent since World War II. The term “ethnic cleansing” became synonymous with Bosnia, where Serb forces loyal to Milosevic tried to carve out a separate state by forcing out the non-Serb civilian population.\n\nThe Clinton administration did not intervene until the massacre at Srebrenica in 1995, when Serbs killed 8,000 Muslim men and boys, which led to the US-brokered Dayton Peace Plan. But when Milosevic then tried to move his ethno-nationalist plan to Kosovo, the Clinton administration gathered a coalition to stop him doing there what he had gotten away with in Bosnia.\n\nAlbright accused Milosevic of creating “a horror of biblical proportions” in his “desire to exterminate a group of people” – Kosovo’s Muslim majority. She came under heated criticism in Washington at the time, with some calling the NATO airstrikes “Albright’s War” while others accused her of misjudging Milosevic’s resolve. To that end, Albright said in 1999, “I take full responsibility along with my colleagues for believing that it was essential for us not to stand by and watch what Milosevic was planning to do,” adding that “we cannot watch crimes against humanity.”\n\nUltimately, the US-led coalition did stop Serbian aggression, and Kosovo declared independence in 2008.\n\nRwandan genocide among Albright’s greatest regrets\n\nMadeleine Albright, seen here in 1997, was the first woman to serve as US secretary of state.

At the time that Albright was representing the US at the United Nations, the Clinton administration, haunted by the military fiasco in Somalia a year earlier, argued for withdrawing the majority of UN troops from the country in the early days of the genocide. The ensuing planned slaughter of primarily ethnic Tutsis, as well as some moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists, would leave at least 800,000 dead.\n\nYears later, Albright would call it her “greatest regret from that time.”\n\nLate in Clinton’s second term, Albright also participated in unsuccessful talks to foster peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, which were followed by a second explosion of violence in the region. She was also part of the effort to coax North Korea to abandon its nuclear program by engaging with Kim Jong Il, an effort that was abandoned by George W. Bush.\n\nAlbright’s tenure as secretary of state also saw the al-Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people. She called the attack the “toughest day” of her tenure but would reject criticism that it should have prompted tougher US action against the terror group that would later carry out the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\n“It would have been very hard, pre-9/11, to have persuaded anybody that an invasion of Afghanistan was appropriate,” Albright told the 9/11 Commission in 2004. “I think it did take the megashock, unfortunately, of 9/11, to make people understand the considerable threat.”\n\nWhen pressed by the commission about the argument that the Clinton administration lacked actionable intelligence, Albright said “we used every single tool we had in terms of trying to figure out what the right targets would be and how to go about dealing with what we knew.”\n\nBut she also expressed frustration about the reluctance to push ahead with military force against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.\n\n“From my perspective, the Pentagon did not come forward with viable options in response to what the president was asking for,” Albright said.\n\nLifelong opponent of totalitarianism\n\nBorn Marie Jana Korbelova, the daughter of a Czechoslovakian diplomat, in Prague in 1937, Albright escaped then-Czechoslovakia with her family 10 days after the Nazi invasion. Her experience growing up in communist Yugoslavia and then fleeing to the US made her a lifelong opponent of totalitarianism and fascism. She was raised Roman Catholic, though she later converted to Episcopalian, and learned later in life about her family’s Jewish heritage.\n\nAlbright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and was married to Joseph Albright from 1959 until 1983, when they divorced. They had three children, twins Anne and Alice in 1961 and Katharine in 1967. She attended Columbia University for her master’s degree and Ph.D., which she completed in 1976 before launching on a decades-long career in government service and foreign affairs work under different Democratic politicians and causes.\n\nAlbright was aware of her role as a trailblazer and often spoke of the challenges of being the first woman to lead the State Department.\n\n“I think that there were real questions as to … whether a woman could be secretary of state. And not just in terms of dealing with the issues, but in terms of dealing with the people, especially in hierarchical societies. … I found, actually, that I could do that,” she told CNN in 2005. “And people, I think, now can understand that is perfectly possible for a woman to be secretary of state, and I am delighted that there is second one,” a reference to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThroughout her career, Albright was known for wearing brooches or decorative pins to convey her foreign policy messages. When she found out that the Russians had bugged the State Department, she wore a large bug pin when she next met with them. When Saddam Hussein referred to Albright as a snake, she took to wearing a gold snake pin; when she was called a witch, she proudly brandished a miniature broom. When she slammed as “completely un-American” acting Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli’s suggestion that only immigrants who can “stand on their own two feet” are welcome in the United States, Albright wore a Statue of Liberty pin.\n\nFollowing her tenure as secretary of state, Albright served as chairwoman of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in Washington from 2001 to her death, and she taught at Georgetown University. She was also a prolific author, penning several books, including a memoir in 2003 entitled “Madam Secretary.” She also worked in the private sector for a time.\n\nIn 2012, Albright received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, who said her “toughness helped bring peace to the Balkans and paved the way for progress in some of the most unstable corners of the world.”\n\nA forceful voice on foreign policy in retirement\n\nThroughout her retirement, Albright continued working for democracy around the world and speaking about US policy, leveling particularly harsh criticism toward President Donald Trump, whom she called “the most undemocratic president in modern American history.”\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed written last month just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Albright argued that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would be making “a historic error” and warned of devastating costs to his country.\n\n“Instead of paving Russia’s path to greatness, invading Ukraine would ensure Mr. Putin’s infamy by leaving his country diplomatically isolated, economically crippled and strategically vulnerable in the face of a stronger, more united Western alliance,” Albright wrote.\n\nAsked by USA Today in August 2020 how she defined courage, Albright replied, “it’s when you stand up for what you believe in when it’s not always easy and you get criticized for it.”\n\n“It took me a long time to find my voice. But having found it, I’m not going to shut up,” Albright said. “I’m going to use it to the best of my ability in terms of making sure that democracy is our form of government and that those around the world that want to live in a democracy have a possibility to do so.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction and details.", "authors": ["Caroline Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}]}

Can it make a comeback ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMarc Rosen didn’t flinch when he was offered the top job at JCPenney last year.\n\nA stalwart of twentieth-century retail for middle-class Americans seeking affordable clothing and home furnishings, JCPenney has struggled for more than a decade and fell into bankruptcy shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut Rosen, a retail veteran who previously worked at Walmart and Levi’s, said he “did not have any personal hesitancy at all” about trying to revitalize the 120-year-old brand and protect JCPenney from extinction like Barney’s, Lord & Taylor, Century 21 and other shuttered retailers.\n\n“I believe in taking on large scale transformation,” Rosen, 54, told CNN Business in a video interview this month. “There was an opportunity to really take this brand and make it relevant again.”\n\nRosen is staking his turnaround plan on appealing to “America’s diverse working families.”\n\nThe typical customer at JCPenney has a median household income of between $50,000 to $75,000. Roughly 30% of the retailer’s customers are Black, Indigenous and people of color, according to the company, a larger share than many competitors\n\nJCPenney CEO Marc Rosen took over last year. He is trying to regain working-class customers. Amy E. Price/Getty Images for SXSW\n\nSo JCPenney is chasing these shoppers with an overhauled beauty strategy after a long partnership with Sephora ended. It has remodeled stores and added new major brands and private-label clothing and home furnishings’ labels. The company has also improved its technology and online experience to draw more online sales. Just a quarter of JCPenney’s sales are online, trailing rivals.\n\nRosen said customers now are shopping at JCPenney more frequently, the first time that has happened for the brand in years, and it’s regaining market share in key departments such as home goods. (JCPenney does not break out sales publicly.)\n\nBut there are signs of pressure: visits to all JCPenney stores were down 29% as of October from the same time a year ago, according to data from Placer.ai. In October, traffic to JCPenney’s website increased only 1.26% from a year ago, according to data from SimilarWeb.\n\nNow, a year into Rosen’s tenure, he faces his biggest test at JCPenney yet: the holiday shopping stretch. And it comes at an uncertain moment for the US economy and shoppers.\n\nJCPenney faces a critical holiday shopping season. Richard Vogel/AP\n\nThe company said it’s off to a strong start to the holiday season. But JCPenney’s main customers are feeling strained by the highest inflation in 40 years and they have shown signs of pulling back on discretionary goods— the bulk of what JCPenney sells.\n\nRosen also has to dig out from years of mismanagement and failed strategies at the company.\n\nThe company faces unrelenting pressure from much larger retailers such as Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). TJX (TJX), the owner of TJMaxx and Marshalls and other “off-price” retailers that have undercut the department stores’ model by selling designer brands at bargain prices.\n\n“The future is going to be a challenging one because it’s difficult for department stores to navigate, even under the best circumstances,” said Erin Schmidt, a senior analyst at Coresight Research, a retail advisory and research firm. “The competition is really fierce.”\n\nRise and fall\n\nJCPenney started as the Golden Rule, a dry goods store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in 1902.\n\nIts founder, James Cash Penney, quickly expanded the business and by 1917, there were 175 stores, later renamed JCPenney. By 1929, on the eve of the stock market crash and Great Depression, JCPenney had 1,000 stores.\n\nIts stores were known for their low prices. Merchandise could be bought only with cash, not on credit.\n\nJCPenney survived the Depression and by 1950, Fortune Magazine declared the company the “King of Soft Goods.” Penney himself became known as the “Man with a Thousand Partners.”\n\nBy the time he died in 1971, JCPenney had more than 1,600 stores, many in newly-built suburban malls, and was the fifth largest US retailer.\n\nBut the company’s mid-market appeal was tested by growing competition during the 1980s and 1990s. Discount stores including Walmart and Target spread, stealing away JCPenney’s budget-conscious customers.\n\nThe company was hit hard by the Great Recession in 2008. It lost shoppers to discount stores and struggled to bring them back as the economy began to rebound.\n\nJCPenney was a retail powerhouse during the twentieth century. But it has struggled for more than a decade. Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nBy the end of 2010, JCPenney’s sales had fallen 10% from their 2006 high of about $20 billion, and the company attracted the scrutiny of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Ackman bought up a chunk of Penney and installed Ron Johnson, Apple’s former head of stores, as CEO.\n\nWithout testing shoppers’ reactions first, JCPenney under Johnson changed its advertisements, its logo and its store designs.\n\nPeople walk past a JCPenney store at the Queens Center Mall in New York in 2016. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Businessman James Cash Penney points to a picture of his first store in Kemmerer, Wyoming. JCPenney started in 1902 as a dry-goods store called the Golden Rule Store. At the time, Penney's business practices were revolutionary. He banned haggling, a common practice at the time, to keep prices low. And he encouraged his employees to \"serve the public to its ultimate satisfaction.\" The company changed its name a decade later, opened many more stores and went public in 1929.

And it ended coupons, a move that alienated loyal shoppers.\n\nJCPenney’s sales plunged $4.3 billion in 2012, a 25% drop from the previous year. Johnson left in 2013, 17 months into the job.\n\nThe company cycled through several CEOs and strategies in the following years and brought back appliances for the first time in decades, a move that didn’t resonate with customers. The company was unprofitable every year beginning in 2011 and its sales fell each year starting in 2015.\n\nIn May of 2020, soon after the Covid-19 pandemic began and JCPenney was forced to close stores temporarily, the company filed for bankruptcy after 118 years in business.\n\nAt the time, JCPenney had more than 800 stores and 85,000 employees.\n\nTurning around JCPenney\n\nJCPenney has around 670 stores today and has little debt for the first time in years.\n\nThe company is owned by mall landlords Simon Property Group (SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). The two firms rescued JCPenney out of bankruptcy for $1.75 billion in the fall of 2020. It was their interest to do so. JCPenney was a key tenant at hundreds of malls and a liquidation would have left vacancies in their shopping centers.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy process, JCPenney restructured its debt and closed more than 200 stores.\n\nRosen said JCPenney now has the financial flexibility to invest in upgrading its technology, supply chain and revamping stores under under its new owners.\n\nMall owners Simon and Brookfield bought JCPenney out of bankruptcy. Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n\n“That alignment with ownership is critical, especially as you’re going through a transformation that requires significant investment,” he said.\n\nInstead of chasing new shoppers, as several of Rosen’s predecessors tried to do, he has built a strategy centered on convincing existing budget-focused customers to visit more frequently and buy a wider array of goods at JCPenney instead of other stores.\n\nThe company is attempting to highlight merchandise and services like hair salons and family portrait offerings that resonate with the its core working-class families. Teachers are the number one profession among its customers, so JCPenney has focused on ensuring stores have clothing they want to wear to work.\n\nJCPenney’s 14-year partnership with Sephora ended in 2020 and it has started to replace many Sephora shops with new beauty departments. Roughly 20% of the products in new beauty areas come from a partnership with Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce company that features brands started by founders of color.\n\n“Customers want to see brands that are brought to them by Brown and Black founders, and they want to see brands that look relevant to their skin types,” Rosen said.\n\nRetail experts say that JCPenney is improving under Rosen and his strategy to target different customers than competitors is shrewd. Stores are better lit than they were before the bankruptcy and top vendors are selling merchandise to the company again.\n\n“A lot of people in the industry wrote them off,” said David Katz, chief marketing officer at Randa Apparel & Accessories, which makes Levi’s, Dockers, Haggar and other brands. “Today, they are a good partner. We’re giving them a lot more financial credit than we used to. We are developing more products for them because we have confidence they’ll be able to sell it effectively.”\n\nJCPenney and other department stores have been squeezed by competition in retail. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/ZUMA Press\n\nStill, JCPenney faces both short-term challenges and long-term questions about its survival.\n\nInflation is squeezing customers, particularly its middle-income shoppers. It’s not the only retailer facing that problem – Kohl’s said last week that its middle-income customers are buying fewer items when they shop and switching to private brands.\n\nRosen said that more JCPenney customers are buying the company’s lowest-priced products and switching to its cheaper private brands. The company plans to offer some products at 2019 prices during the holidays, including its St. John’s Bay cable sweater.\n\nThe bigger question remains whether there is a place for JCPenney in the changing era of retail and if it can draw younger customers.\n\nStiff competition has taken a toll on the entire department store landscape, including Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy’s (M).\n\nJCPenney can’t solely rely on winning more business from existing shoppers with limited discretionary ability, said Schmidt from Coresight. The chain needs to attract new shoppers, too. But winning new customers has never been harder.\n\n“They’re doing some really good things in terms of their positioning,” Schmidt said. “But the department store is a tough place to be. It will be a challenging road.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/05/19/memorial-day-furniture-sale-shop-furniture-deals-wayfair-target-and-more/5219258002/", "title": "The 26 best Memorial Day furniture sales you can shop right now", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/20/us-industries-being-devastated-by-the-coronavirus-travel-hotels-food/111431804/", "title": "Industries hit hardest by coronavirus in the US include retail ...", "text": "Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which has been designated a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, is having a devastating impact on the U.S. economy. After peaking at 29,000 in February, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 21,000 by mid-March – a nearly 30% drop. On March 16, the Dow fell by nearly 3,000 points, the largest single-day drop in history.\n\nAs the U.S. tries to stem the spread of the virus and contain the outbreak, life is slowly grinding to a halt – and with it much of the economy. While all industries have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, some bear the brunt of the downturn much more than others. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed industry publications and data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine the U.S. industries being devastated most by the outbreak.\n\nThe restaurant industry is one of the most exposed industries to major upheaval as a result of the pandemic, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended avoiding groups of over 50 people. Some cities and states have told restaurants to switch to takeout only. Millions of jobs in the sector could either be lost or severely impacted by the outbreak.\n\nSocial Security offices closed:How to get help with benefits during coronavirus pandemic\n\nDow, S&P 500 keep falling:So how will we know when the stock market drop is over?\n\nSome American workers have already been laid off or furloughed, and more job cuts are likely. As people start to socially distance themselves, those in white collar jobs will more easily be able to work from home, while hourly workers in sectors like hospitality and retail may be let go as their companies get less business. This further jeopardizes some of the least financially secure workers in the country – jobs in these fields are often part-time and typically pay low wages.\n\nGambling\n\nMuch of the nation's $261 billion casino gaming industry has been shuttered because of measures taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Casinos in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and other major gaming destinations have been closed, and some staff members have been furloughed or laid off. All casinos in Massachusetts and Illinois were ordered to close for two weeks, and Maryland's casinos, racetracks, and other betting facilities were ordered to close indefinitely.\n\nThe novel coronavirus also hit the U.S. just before the beginning of one of the industry's biggest events – the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. During the 2019 tournament, Americans wagered an estimated $8.5 billion on games. With the NBA, NHL, European soccer, and nearly every other major sporting event canceled for the foreseeable future, the sports betting industry has essentially dried up.\n\nSports books in Las Vegas typically handle $500 million worth of bets in a given month. Though some UFC events are still ongoing as of March 16, Joe Asher, CEO of sports bookmaker William Hill, told Sports Illustrated that the entire sports betting industry will have \"pretty much zero revenue\" until sporting events resume. This could take at least six weeks.\n\nUSA TODAY analysis:America's coronavirus 'curve' may be at its most dangerous point\n\nCasinos during coronavirus pandemic:Sports books in Las Vegas are getting creative to offset March Madness betting losses\n\nAirlines\n\nThe airline industry will likely be especially hard hit by the pandemic, as international and even domestic flights are restricted. The International Air Transport Association projected that the U.S. and Canadian airline industry could lose as much as $21.1 billion in revenue. The worldwide industry could see a decline in passenger revenue of nearly 20% under the extensive spread scenario, which would result in an estimated $113 billion in lost revenue. The CAPA - Centre for Aviation said most airlines in the world will likely go bankrupt by the end of May 2020.\n\nUnited Airlines said it was bracing for a $1.5 billion revenue drop in March 2020 compared to March 2019. It also plans to cut capacity in half for April and May. Other U.S. airlines are planning similar actions, as well as freezing hiring and asking employees to take unpaid leave. In what may be a sign of things to come, Norwegian Airlines laid off 90% of staff on March 16. As of 2018, there were over 445,000 workers in the airline industry. A group representing many of the country's largest airlines asked the government for $25 billion in grants and $25 billion in low or no-interest loans.\n\nRunning out of toilet paper?:These are the places where you can still some\n\nTesla and coronavirus:Elon Musk says automaker is working on ventilators for patients\n\nHotels\n\nThe U.S. hotel industry employs over 1.6 million Americans, making it the ninth-largest sector in the U.S. in terms of total workers. But as people have stayed home, demand for hotels has declined sharply. In the first week of March, there was an 11.6% decline in revenue per room available in U.S. hotels compared to the same week of 2019, according to hotel research firm STR.\n\nIn response, hotels in New York City, Seattle, Knoxville, Tennessee, and more have begun to lay off dozens of workers. Hotel workers in major tourist destinations have been told to brace for job losses as well. The hotel chain Marriott just announced plans to lay off tens of thousands of workers. Industry groups urged Congress to pass a supplemental aid package to help hotels through the pandemic.\n\nMovie theaters\n\nIt's been some time now that health officials nationwide have urged social distancing, and movie theaters felt the impact of that recommendation. Now that the CDC has requested that Americans avoid gathering in groups of 50 or more, movie theaters have no choice but close down. U.S. box office revenue for the weekend of March 13-15 came in at just over $54 million, the lowest since September 2000. For context, no weekend box office in 2020 pulled in less than $80 million.\n\nThe effects could stretch for months, as blockbusters like \"Mulan,\" \"A Quiet Place Part II,\" \"Fast 9,\" and the latest James Bond film, \"No Time to Die,\" were slated to be released in the coming weeks, but all these releases were pushed back. Over 100 theaters have closed, and more are expected to follow suit. Major theater chain AMC has announced the closure of all U.S. theaters. Regal announced it would close all of its theaters until further notice, more than 500 in total, leaving over 25,000 employees without work.\n\nLive sports\n\nThe postponement or suspension of sports leagues like the NBA, NHL, XFL, and more have created a huge vacuum not just for the leagues and players, but also the wide-ranging ecosystem that has cropped up around them. FiveThirtyEight estimates that, since about 21% of the NBA season remained when games were halted, the league stands to lose $350 million-$450 million from ticket sales alone if those games are not played – and that does not even include lost playoff revenues.\n\nThe league could also lose up to $200 million in non-ticket revenue, from sources like parking, concessions, merchandise, and more. Still, many NBA franchises – along with their owners and star players – have committed millions of dollars to ensure that arena staff hourly workers are paid during the pandemic. There are an estimated 300 staff workers in a 20,000-seat arena, like those that host NBA games.\n\nThe NHL does not make as much as the NBA but could lose a larger share of its expected yearly revenue. Because the league does not draw as many TV viewers, it relies more heavily on ticket sales. The MLB could be affected as well, as it will not begin games until mid-May, at the earliest.\n\nMarch Madness:'Heartbroken' over decision to cancel because of coronavirus concerns\n\nFood delivery:Lyft looking to add food, medical supplies to delivery service\n\nCruises\n\nAfter a luxury Diamond Princess ship became the first large outbreak cluster outside China, with at least 634 confirmed COVID-19 infections among passengers and crew and two deaths, the cruise industry has taken a huge hit. More recently, a Grand Princess cruise docking in Oakland resulted in 28 cases of the disease. As of March 16, there were at least seven cruise ships in limbo because passengers tested positive or were showing symptoms of the virus and no country was willing to take them in.\n\nShares of three major cruise companies – Royal Caribbean, Carnival Corp., and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings – dropped over 50% in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry group Cruise Lines International Association said the cruise industry contributes $53 billion to the U.S. economy every year. The White House has made clear it intends to help the industry weather the financial difficulty with some sort of relief bill.\n\nShipping\n\nA supply management survey found that three out of every four American businesses experienced a disruption to some part of their supply line due to the irregularities in the shipping industry stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. China is one of the world's foremost shipping hubs, but COVID-19 has forced the country to close ports and send factory workers home. The International Chamber of Shipping said the pandemic has cost the worldwide industry around $350 million per week.\n\nThe outbreak has affected everyone in this highly globalized industry, and Americans are no exception. In January, North American transport volume was down 9.4% compared to the same month of 2019. There are over 225,000 Americans working in the freight transportation industry, and the disruption has jeopardized over billions in wages for these workers.\n\nFilm production\n\nOscar-winning actor Tom Hanks announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus. Consequently, production of the film he was shooting at the time was shut down. Hanks' film was one of a dozens of films and TV shows that halted production – either out of caution or because a cast or crew member had symptoms, tested positive, or came into contact with someone who did. These films likely would have likely contributed billions of dollars to the U.S. box office and economy in other ways.\n\nEach time a production shuts down, it puts hundreds of crew members and cast out of work. Movies often have well over 500 crew members, including drivers, lighting technicians, directors, production assistants, camera operators, and more. Some of the larger films that have extensive visual effects have thousands of people credited. There are over 220,000 Americans working in the film production industry.\n\nAutomakers\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic lingers, the demand for cars is decreasing. Workers who are concerned about their job security and try to save their money for emergency use are less likely to buy a car. This jeopardizes the jobs of the nearly 1.3 million Americans who work in new and used car dealerships. Researchers have predicted that American auto sales could decline year-over-year by as much as 20% in 2020. The shares of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler have all lost over 25% of their value since the beginning of March.\n\nAutomakers have also faced serious supply chain disruptions as parts imports from China have become much more difficult as the country grapples with the disease. Four out of every five cars made in the world rely on parts manufactured in China.\n\nOil and gas\n\nAs people continue to work from home and avoid travel, the demand for oil and gas has plummeted. The International Energy Agency projects a decline in demand of 90,000 barrels of oil in 2020 compared to 2019. Prior to the pandemic, the IEA projected an increase in demand of over 800,000 barrels. The effects on the oil industry have been especially dire because China, the world's top energy consumer, was the first to be hit as the source of the outbreak. The price of oil has been in an unprecedented freefall, selling for under $30 per barrel as of March 16.\n\nRetail\n\nThe U.S. retail industry has been devastated by the coronavirus outbreak, and a number of stores have already had to close their doors. Apple has closed all stores outside of China until at least March 27, and other major retailers in fashion, sporting goods stores, and tech have made similar announcements, with more coming in every day.\n\nUrban Outfitters, Nike, and other companies have announced plans to pay workers at least in the short term for lost wages. This is good news for the employees, many of whom are among the lowest-paid American workers, but it will, of course, mean the companies' bottom lines will take a hit. One Jefferies analyst told CNBC, \"With stores accounting for 75% of sales for most retailers, we anticipate massive EPS [earnings per share] declines for 1Q, especially as most retailers appear to be paying employees during the 2 week closures.\"\n\nConfined amid coronavirus?:Here are best practices for remote-managing your small business\n\nTech\n\nMany Chinese factories in locked-down areas have closed operations since late January. This has had a major impact on the ability of many American tech companies to continue producing their products regularly. Production of video game consoles, smartphones, and smartwatches are all predicted to drop by over 10%. Apple could lose as much as $67 billion because of an iPhone shortage. Graphics card producer Nvidia lowered its projected earnings for the first quarter of 2020 by $100 million, saying the pandemic is disrupting its supply chain.\n\nApple, Samsung, and Google all closed corporate offices and factories in China. Many major tech companies are headquartered in and around Seattle – one of the areas hardest hit by the virus. Microsoft said it would continue to pay its 4,500 hourly employees, even as it sent many workers home.\n\nConventions\n\nAs mass gatherings of people have been declared unsafe, many of the massive conventions that draw thousands of attendees from across the globe have been canceled. The cancellations of tech conferences like E3, SXSW, and more have likely cost local economies over $1.1 billion. In 2019 alone, SXSW's full-time and seasonal workers had an economic impact of over $150 million on the Austin, Texas, economy, according to consulting firm Greyhill Advisors and SXSW.\n\nThe cancellation of the E3 conference has also cost the video game industry its biggest week of the year. New games and consoles are often unveiled at the event, which usually hosts over 65,000 guests a year. Facebook and Google also had to scrap their own conventions. This moratorium on large gatherings could devastate the 55,000-person industry of convention and trade show organizers in the U.S.\n\nFood service\n\nBetween full- and limited-service restaurants, caterers, buffets, and more, well over 10 million Americans work in the food service industry. Major cities have ordered restaurants to only offer takeout options as a preventive measure. This could jeopardize billions in wages for employees, many of whom are hourly workers. Chinese restaurants have been particularly hard hit over unfounded stigmas related to the outbreak.\n\nNation's Restaurant News reported that in Seattle, restaurants were expected to lose 20% of sales in the first week of March. By March 16, a dozen states had imposed restrictions on restaurants hosting dine-in customers. On the weekend of March 14, restaurants in most of America's major cities reported a decline in occupancy of anywhere from 30%-64%. Research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that over 600 food service industry job cuts were directly related to the pandemic, and that 7.4 million jobs in the sector could either be cut or severely impacted.\n\nTheme parks\n\nLarge theme parks have stopped welcoming guests in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, closing a massive industry for the foreseeable future. Disney is by far the largest theme park operator in the world, with six parks – all of which were shuttered initially as the outbreak spread. Disney reported over $26.2 billion revenue from its parks in fiscal 2019. Dividing this evenly throughout the year would mean the company could lose revenue of around $500 million per week that its parks were closed, assuming the same earnings this year.\n\nOther prominent parks have been affected as well. All SeaWorld parks are closed; Six Flags temporarily closed 10 of its parks; and Universal Studios closed its Orlando and Hollywood parks through the end of March. Nationwide, there are nearly 200,000 people who work at theme parks, many of whom could be out of work throughout the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nGyms\n\nGyms were already facing challenges from home exercise companies like Peloton, and social distancing recommendations and the fear of the spread of the coronavirus have further added to the challenges large gyms and group fitness classes face. Gyms and boutique fitness classes have ballooned into a $94 billion industry that is now in jeopardy.\n\nEquinox had to close its gyms in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and Barry's Bootcamp cut capacity in half. In Los Angeles, the mayor ordered all gyms to be closed. Gold's Gym and Orangetheory shuttered all corporate-owned locations. Planet Fitness stock lost 48% of its market value.\n\nConsumers:Don't overpay for these common items\n\nWork at home?:Charter, MicroStrategy reverse policies, allow it during coronavirus outbreak\n\nConstruction\n\nAs the coronavirus devastates the U.S. economy, companies will likely pull back on expansion, leaving a huge gap in the construction industry. Two large airlines, Delta and United, each announced plans to reduce capital investment by $2 billion each as a result of the pandemic's economic impact. Companies in many other sectors are expected to follow suit.\n\nSmaller construction companies may have to lay off workers as their supply of equipment and parts from China is disrupted. There are an estimated 7.6 million Americans working in the construction sector who could be affected by these changes.\n\nTransportation\n\nWith Americans working from home and staying in instead of visiting bars and restaurants, ride sharing companies like Uber and Lyft are seeing their potential ridership dissipate. Both companies announced they would stop letting different users share the same car.\n\nUber has pledged financial assistance to drivers who are quarantined and not able to work, though this would likely not impact most of the estimated 900,000 U.S. drivers. Many drivers are reporting 50% declines in income as fewer people use ride sharing services. Uber's stock has also cratered, going from over $40 per share in February to less than $19 as of March 17.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, has plummeted about 65% so far this year. It was trading at about $16,500 on Monday, according to CoinDesk. Analysts believe that it could fall below $10,000.\n\nEther, the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency, isn’t faring much better. It was trading at about $1,230 on Monday, having sunk over 20% over the last week, CoinDesk data showed.\n\nThe plunge comes as investors continue to grapple with the stunning implosion of FTX, one of the biggest and most powerful players in the industry.\n\nSome industry insiders have said the company’s downfall had triggered a “Lehman moment,” referring to the 2008 collapse of the investment bank that sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nThe episode has not just destroyed confidence in the crypto industry, but will also embolden global regulators to tighten the screws. Some of the biggest names in the business said they will welcome the scrutiny, if it helps restore faith in the industry.\n\nThere is a “lot of risk,” said Changpeng Zhao, who runs Binance, the biggest crypto exchange. “We have seen in the past week things go crazy in the industry, so we do need some regulations, we do need to do this properly,” he added.\n\nCZ, as he’s known, was speaking at a conference in Indonesia on Monday. He said last week that comparing the current crypto turmoil to the 2008 global financial crisis is “probably an accurate analogy.”\n\nBinance had reached a tentative rescue deal with FTX earlier last week, but that transaction almost immediately fell apart.\n\nFTX has continued its downward spiral after filing for bankruptcy on Friday. Another big name from the industry has also admitted to mishandling funds, spooking investors even more.\n\nHere is how things have unfolded over the last few days, showing the crisis has only just begun.\n\nCriminal investigation in The Bahamas\n\nFTX moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to The Bahamas last year, with former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried hailing it as “one of the few places to set up a comprehensive framework for crypto” at the time.\n\nOn Sunday, the authorities in The Bahamas said they were investigating potential criminal misconduct surrounding the company’s implosion.\n\n“In light of the collapse of FTX globally and the provisional liquidation of FTX Digital Markets Ltd., a team of financial investigators from the Financial Crimes Investigation Branch are working closely with the Bahamas Securities Commission to investigate if any criminal misconduct occurred,” the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a statement.\n\nIt’s not clear which particular aspect of the swift collapse of FTX authorities are investigating.\n\nBankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the exchange, was one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He had been viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in previously to rescue companies struggling after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in May.\n\nFTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world. Its collapse was preceded by the decision to lend billions of dollars’ worth of customer assets to fund risky bets by Alameda, Bankman-Fried’s crypto hedge fund, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\n\nA possible hack\n\nThe Bahamas probe came a day after the bankrupt exchange said it was launching an investigation of its own.\n\nOn Saturday, FTX said it was looking into whether crypto assets were stolen. Crypto risk management firm Elliptic said $473 million in crypto assets appear to have been nabbed from FTX.\n\nFTX General Counsel Ryne Miller said Saturday the company “initiated precautionary steps” on Friday and moved all its digital assets offline. The process was expedited Friday evening “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.”\n\nMiller said that FTX was “investigating abnormalities” regarding movements in crypto wallets “related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.”\n\nThe facts are still unclear, and the company will share more information as soon as possible, he added.\n\nAccidental transfers and Binance warning\n\nAs scrutiny of big players in the crypto world increases, Singapore-based Crypto.com admitted to accidentally sending more than $400 million in ether to the wrong account.\n\nCEO Kris Marszalek said Sunday that the transfer of 320,000 ETH was made three weeks ago to a corporate account at competing exchange Gate.io, instead of to one of its offline, or “cold,” wallets.\n\nThough the funds were recovered, users are withdrawing their funds from the platform, fearing it could collapse like FTX.\n\n“We have since strengthened our process and systems to better manage these internal transfers,” Marszalek tweeted Sunday. The platform’s native token has fallen over 20% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk.\n\nMarszalek said Monday that his firm has acted as a “responsible, regulated player since inception” and will soon “prove all the naysayers …wrong with our actions.”\n\nCrypto.com has 70 million people on its platform globally, and its business model is “completely different” from FTX, he added.\n\n“We never took any third-party risks, we do not run a hedge fund, we do not trade customer assets,” he said.\n\nMarszalek said his firm will publish an audited report showing its reserves soon.\n\nAt the conference in Bali, Binance boss Zhao signaled that regulating the industry won’t be easy.\n\nAuthorities’ “natural response is to borrow regulations from traditional banking systems … but crypto exchanges operate very, very differently from banks,” he said.\n\n“It is very, very normal for a bank to move user assets for investments and try to make returns,” he explained. If a crypto exchange operates that way it is “almost guaranteed to go down,” he said. adding that the industry collectively had a role to play in protecting consumers.\n\n“Regulators have a role… but no can can protect a bad player,” he said.\n\n— Matt Egan, Ramishah Maruf and Allison Morrow contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Diksha Madhok"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far.

It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fervent opponent of Biden who has called for his impeachment, yelled at him twice during the State of the Union address.\n\nThe first time came as Biden said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare – an accusation that Greene refuted when she stood up yelled “Liar!”\n\nGreene later yelled, “China spied on us!” near the end of Biden’s speech.\n\nShe also yelled to “close the border” and “it’s your fault” when the president talked about the fentanyl crisis.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nHeckling lawmakers:Marjorie Taylor Greene, other Republicans spar with Biden over Social Security, Medicare\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden on Tyre Nichols’ death: ‘Something good must come from this’\n\nBiden used his speech to pay tribute to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBiden called for more police training and more resources to reduce violent crime, along with more investments in housing, education and training.\n\nNoting that Nichols’ mother and stepfather were seated in the first lady’s box, Biden urged lawmakers to commit themselves to making the words of Nichols’ mother come true: “Something good must come from this.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTyre Nichols killing:7 more Memphis police employees under investigation in Tyre Nichols' death, city attorney says\n\nBiden invokes Uvalde massacre in call for gun reform\n\nIn a call to action on gun violence, Biden invoked his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after the Robb Elementary School shooting where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\n“Do something, do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with everyone.” Biden said, then pointing to the bipartisan gun reform law he signed. “Thank god we did. Passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nUvalde shooting:Her daughter was killed in Uvalde. She's suing police, the school district and a gunmaker.\n\nCOVID is under control but vigilance necessary, says Biden\n\nWhile COVID-19 deaths are down nearly 90%, and the end of the public health emergency is close, Biden said the country will remember the pain of losing loved ones will never go away for many.\n\n“Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. He urged Congress to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nThe COVID emergency declaration is ending:What it means for tests, vaccines, treatment\n\nBiden: Police departments 'must be held accountable'\n\nSaying Tyre Nichols’ mother wants something good to come from his death at the hands of police officers in Memphis, Biden called for police reform.\n\n“When police officers or departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable,” he said.\n\nBiden also pointed to an executive order he signed affecting federal officers that banned chokeholds, restricted no-knock warrants, and implemented “other key elements of the George Floyd Act.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nTyre Nichols:Ex-Memphis police officer took a photo of Tyre Nichols after beating, document says\n\nBiden urges Congress to act on labor reform\n\nBiden called for Congress to take up labor reform and worker protections as he touted his support for unions and his pledge to be “the most pro-union president.”\n\n“I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing,” said Biden. “Workers have a right to form a union.”\n\nBiden also urged action on additional worker protections and benefits, including paid family and medical leave and affordable child care, specifically calling for the return of the expanded Child Tax Credit.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nLabor secretary makes move:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBiden calls for rebooting the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nParents who qualify for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) won’t be getting as hefty checks as last year. That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023? Here's what you need to know about qualifying.\n\nBiden: Ban ‘junk fees’ on hotel bills, other services\n\nBiden urged Congress to pass legislation to ban excess fees that companies often tack onto hotel bills, airline tickets and other services.\n\n“Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” he said.\n\nThe Junk Fee Prevention Act, if approved, would bar so-called “resort fees” that can add up to $90 a night on hotel bills, stop cable internet and cell phone companies from charging up to $200 more when a customer switches providers, and prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families to sit together, Biden said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJunk fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nSocial Security and Medicare benefits draw tension during speech\n\nBiden’s State of the Union address comes as he and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have started talks on the debt ceiling and government spending.\n\nTension has been building between the two parties over Social Security and Medicare benefits. McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets? Answers here\n\nBiden calls climate crisis ‘an existential threat’\n\nBiden said “the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state” as he touted his administration’s work to take on what he called “an existential threat.”\n\nHe pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest climate package ever, and investments from his infrastructure law.\n\nHe later went off-script, saying, “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUN Secretary-General::'No more baby steps' on climate change\n\nBiden to Congress: Continue insurance subsidies that lowered uninsured rates\n\nBiden celebrated the fact that a record number of Americans have health insurance while calling on Congress to continue expanded insurance subsidies that helped boost that rate.\n\nThose enhanced subsidies for people who purchase insurance on their own, instead of getting coverage from the government or an employer, expire after 2025.\n\n“Let’s finish the job and make the savings permanent,” Biden said as he also called for extending expanded Medicaid coverage to all states.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden takes made in America a step further\n\nBiden touted American manufacturing gains and a campaign promise to move more production to the U.S. from foreign countries. Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections. Biden also congratulated her successor, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black American to be House minority leader.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat are burn pits?:Why were burn pits used? Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward.

But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/11/14/group-recent-princeton-grads-winning-lotteries-across-u-s/6254098002/", "title": "A group of recent Princeton grads is winning lotteries across U.S.", "text": "A group of recent Ivy League graduates is making a run on lotteries across America.\n\nSo far they’ve won more than $6 million from lotteries in Indiana, Missouri, Washington and the District of Columbia.\n\nExactly how they’re doing it – and how much they are profiting, if any – remains a mystery.\n\nThe unusual winning streak first came to light in Indiana after the apparent leader of the group, a 27-year-old Princeton University graduate named Manuel Montori IV, cashed in 61 winning Hoosier Lottery scratch-off tickets on a single day in September.\n\nAll of the winnings came from the same game, $7,000,000 MEGA CA$H, which sells for $30 a ticket. Most of Montori’s winners were for $1,000, but three were for $10,000, bringing his total haul to $88,000.\n\nBut that was just one day. Just one state.\n\nThe second gentleman:Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff breaks gender stereotypes\n\nRestaurants, stores struggle to survive:So why are many boosting spending, hiring workers?\n\nMontori has been on an 18-month winning streak, or so it would appear. It includes much larger paydays and is part of a scheme that includes at least three other Princeton alumni: Matthew Gibbons, Hannah Davinroy and Zoë Buonaiuto. All of them are associated with an obscure company Montori founded last year called Black Swan Capital LLC.\n\nTheir biggest payday came a week after the Hoosier Lottery bonanza. Montori collected a $5 million top prize from a scratch-off ticket in Missouri on Oct. 6. Other winnings identified by IndyStar include:\n\n$121,000 Davinroy collected from the Missouri Lottery in September.\n\n$1 million Davinroy collected on behalf of Black Swan from the DC Lottery on Dec. 16, 2019.\n\n$100,000 Montori collected from the DC Lottery on March 25, 2019.\n\nThey also had a 1-in-5 shot at another $1 million in a Hoosier Lottery second chance drawing at the Indiana State Fair last year. Gibbons was one of the finalists selected from players who submitted non-winning tickets. He didn't win that one, but did collect a $500 consolation prize.\n\nIt’s a good bet, however, they’ve had other big paydays that haven’t come to light yet.\n\nTheir record raises several questions. Are Montori, Gibbons, Buonaiuto and Davinroy really that lucky? Have they found a way to beat the lottery at its own game? Or are they investing far more money than they are winning in a scheme doomed to fail?\n\n'They would clean us out'\n\nIn Indiana, the group appears to have gone on a frenzied buying spree in the final months of the MEGA CA$H game.\n\n“Basically, they would clean us out,” said Darian Crites, a manager at Smoke ‘n’ Lotto in Bloomington, which sold one of the winning $10,000 tickets Montori claimed in September.\n\nShe said two women who identified themselves as Hannah and Zoe were involved in purchasing as many as 400 tickets at time during several visits that began in May. They said they were working for a man conducting a study and the results would later be shared on YouTube.\n\nAfter emptying the store’s inventory on their initial visit, Crites said one of the women asked to be notified when a new supply of tickets arrived. The woman would then return to buy up the new tickets. The pattern continued until the lottery informed the store that the game was sold out.\n\nUltimately, they purchased about 1,600 tickets at a cost of $48,000, Crites estimated.\n\nAnd that was just at her store.\n\nThe other 60 winning tickets Montori cashed in were purchased from more than four dozen different gas stations, liquor stores and other lottery outlets all over Indiana, the Hoosier Lottery website shows. If they purchased similar amounts at each store, Montori and his group would have spent at least $2.3 million. And that doesn’t account for the time, travel or people needed to scoop up tickets from places as far flung as Mishawaka, Corydon, Indianapolis, Richmond and Terre Haute.\n\nA winning $7 million ticket might have made Montori and his friends rich. But without the top prize, the group’s expenses may very well have exceeded its winnings in Indiana. Without knowing the size of the initial outlay, it’s impossible to know.\n\nIn other states, however, the group appears to have struck pay dirt.\n\nThis summer in Missouri, two women snatched up thousands of $5,000,000 Cash Extravaganza tickets during a series of visits to Break Time, a convenience store and gas station near a busy I-70 interchange in Columbia.\n\nThe spree unfolded as the lottery was preparing to close the game. It had been in operation for several years, but at least one of the three top prize tickets remained unclaimed as the clock ticked down.\n\n\"I know they were buying 20 books a day, three times a week here,\" said a store manager who asked that her name not be used. \"It was several weeks.\"\n\nEach book included 20 scratch-off tickets, which sold for $20 each. That meant the women were dropping $8,000 a visit. The manager said they paid with cash or cashier's checks, and they weren't just buying at Break Time.\n\n\"They were doing the same thing I think at least at two other stores,\" she said. \"And I think there's another store in another town that they were doing it, buying from them, too.\"\n\nThis time, the gamble paid off. Big. They found the unclaimed $5 million winner. And Montori swooped in to collect.\n\n'Needle in a haystack'\n\nThe group’s activity bears the hallmarks of a longstanding strategy for improving the odds to beat scratch-off games. The approach relies on publicly available data on ticket sales and unclaimed prizes to determine if and when it is advantageous to jump in and buy up tickets, several lottery experts and statisticians told IndyStar.\n\nThe Hoosier Lottery, for example, updates its website daily with information about how many prizes have been claimed for each scratch off game.\n\n“I think a good analogy is that needle-in-the-haystack type of thing, where the more information you have, the more hay you're likely to be able to remove, to where your chances of finding the needle are much, much better,\" said Jeffrey C. Miecznikowski, a professor in the Department of Biostatistics at SUNY University in Buffalo, New York. “I think that's most likely what's going on here.”\n\nBut pulling such a plan off on a large scale, he said, takes a gambler’s nerve and a fat bankroll.\n\nThat may be how Black Swan Capital, LLC, fits into the picture.\n\nMontori and Gibbons registered the corporation in Delaware on June 27, 2019. Buonaiuto's LinkedIn page and other online sources list her as portfolio manager and director of operations from April to October. The business address listed in a report filed in January is a nondescript, white frame house next to a cemetery in Princeton. It is the same address Montori used to register to vote.\n\nThe company is classified as an open-end investment fund. If its name is any indication, the Princeton grads appear to believe they’ve found a formula for playing the odds that could shake up the lottery industry. In the world of economics, the term “black swan” refers to an extremely rare and highly consequential event that is easily explainable, but only in hindsight.\n\nBlack Swan Capital first comes up in connection with the lottery winnings in a news release from the DC Lottery in December. It shows Davinroy posing with a giant $1 million check made out to the company. The winning ticket was purchased at the same liquor store as a $100,000 winner Montori cashed in nine months earlier.\n\nBeyond that, little is known about the company.\n\n'Call me back in a year'\n\nMontori and his Ivy League chums aren’t talking about their lottery gambit. All four have avoided interviews and generally kept a low profile regarding their winnings across the country.\n\nMontori appears to have posed for just one of the ubiquitous jackpot winner photographs. In a promotional shot for the DC Lottery, he has a big grin as he holds an even bigger check. He is wearing a black t-shirt and dark-rimmed glasses with a faint beard and hair down near his shoulders.\n\nPublic records and social media sites indicate Montori has lived in Florida and New Jersey and is the son of a prominent Peruvian businessman who lives in Florida. He has no obvious connection to Indiana or other locations where he’s won big lottery prizes.\n\nHe attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, one of America’s most elite boarding schools and alma mater of President Franklin Pierce, 19 U.S. senators and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He was co-president of the Republican Club and on a four-member team that won the Yale University Economics Association's annual High School Economics Competition during his senior year.\n\nAt Princeton, he majored in philosophy. He graduated in 2017 and landed a job as an analyst at the Princeton University Investment Company, which manages the New Jersey school’s endowment.\n\nMontori did not respond to phone and email messages from IndyStar. Attempts to reach him through his family and Gibbons were unsuccessful.\n\nIt was at Princeton where Montori appears to have met his partners in the lottery scheme. Like him, they're young, smart and come from affluent backgrounds.\n\nGibbons, 26, is from Short Hills, New Jersey, and was an Eagle Scout. He was elected president his senior year at Delbarton, a private Benedictine preparatory school for men in Morristown, New Jersey, where he played golf and was an Advanced Placement Scholar. He majored in computer science and history at Princeton, then went to work for ZX Ventures, a New York City investment banking company.\n\nHe declined comment when contacted by phone on Nov. 2. \"I'd rather not speak to a reporter,\" he said. He locked down his LinkedIn page later that day.\n\nDavinroy, 25, was an honor student and captain of the track team her senior year at Centaurus High School in Lafayette, Colorado, a wealthy suburb about 10 miles east of Boulder. She studied physics at Princeton, graduating with Montori and Gibbons in 2017. She then got a job in New York at BloombergNEF, which provides research on clean energy, advanced transport, digital industry, innovative materials and commodities.\n\nShe did not respond to a phone message or attempts to reach her through family and social media.\n\nBuonaiuto, 29, attended Piedmont High School in the San Francisco Bay area and studied history and French at the University of California, Los Angeles. She entered a graduate history program at Princeton in 2013 and earned her Ph.D. in 2018.\n\nShe declined to comment when contacted by phone. “Call me back in a year,” she said. “I'm happy to talk to you in a year. ... It’s exciting.”\n\n'Shooting in the dark'\n\nEven if the group developed a system for using public information to improve their odds, experts expressed skepticism that it could result in reliable profit.\n\nFor example, the odds of winning the $7 million jackpot in the Hoosier Lottery scratch-off game was about one in 2,691,807. Even if the group improved those odds and purchased thousands of tickets, they would still face a significant risk of missing the jackpot.\n\n“That would still be shooting in the dark with better odds, but not with a real strategy for winning,” said Phillip Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies lottery odds. “Somebody doubled their odds, but they haven't made their odds into a reasonable investment.”\n\nHow much players can improve their odds \"depends a lot in terms of how much information you're bringing into the problem,\" said Miecznikowski, the SUNY biostatistician.\n\n\"To win multiple jackpots, I think it's incredibly rare. But there's a lot of variables that go into that in terms of how many tickets are they buying and so on,\" he said. \"I don't know how they're doing it, but they must have access to information most likely that the average person doesn't ... my guess is that (lotteries) are not putting out enough information that you could use some fancy data science algorithms to figure this out.\"\n\nThe lotteries, however, do not seem concerned about the group’s winning streak.\n\n'Nothing out of the ordinary'\n\nThe four participants have not been accused of any crime. In fact, lottery officials in Indiana, Missouri and the District of Columbia told IndyStar that Montori and Davinroy, like all major prize winners, were vetted before receiving their winnings.\n\n\"We have not conducted an investigation that fell outside our standard clearance processes for big winners.\" Wendy Baker, communications manager for the Missouri Lottery, said in an email to IndyStar last week.\n\nLottery officials said there is nothing wrong with players using data about the number of prizes outstanding during the lifetime of scratch-off games, which is regularly updated online.\n\n\"We do it so that there's transparency to our players, so they understand what tickets that they're playing and what money still left on those tickets. It's an industry standard,\" explained Nicole G. Jordan, director of marketing and communications for the DC Lottery.\n\nJordan said the information also can be a resource for players, if they choose to use it. \"Some people are better gamblers,\" she said. \"So they're looking to see what top prizes are still available.\" It is not uncommon for some players to buy large numbers of tickets, she added, but the amount purchased by the Black Swan group is not something most individual players could do.\n\nAnd just because a prize hasn't been collected doesn't necessarily mean the ticket is still in the field, said Baker, the Missouri Lottery spokeswoman.\n\n\"Until a Scratchers top prize is actually claimed at one of our offices,\" she said, \"we don’t know if a top-prize ticket has been sold or whether it’s sitting in someone’s safe deposit box or has even accidentally been thrown away.\"\n\nJulie Henricks Mahurin, director of public relations for the Hoosier Lottery, said Montori’s 61 claims were received and approved “consistent with our statute and administrative rules.”\n\nShe said it’s not uncommon for a player to submit several winning tickets. There are several potential explanations, such as tickets being purchased over an extended period and/or an individual claiming on behalf of a group.\n\n“There was nothing out of the ordinary on the way this game was designed,” she said. “As is indicated on each ticket and on the Hoosier Lottery website, scratch-off tickets with higher price points (such as the $30 ticket you mention) tend to have better overall odds.”\n\nAt this point, it’s impossible to know exactly how much Montori and his pals have profited from the $6 million they’ve collected so far. They appear to have spent tens of thousands of dollars, if not much more, and may have lost money in Indiana.\n\nThe answer, like the explanation of a Black Swan event, will apparently only be revealed by the benefit of hindsight.\n\nContact Tim Evans at 317-444-6204 or tim.evans@indystar.com.

A stunning $44 billion takeover offer with uncertain financing. And a surprise early morning tweet putting the deal on hold, temporarily.\n\nEven by the standards of Twitter, a company that has known plenty of chaos and dysfunction in its history, the weeks-long effort by billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company has proven to be uniquely tumultuous – and there’s no clear end in sight.\n\nShould the deal go through, it would place the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls “free speech” on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates. He has also said he would reverse Twitter’s ban of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of Tesla (TSLA), which he’s partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal – or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk’s Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk’s stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he wrote, with a poll for users to vote “yes” or “no.”\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?”\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to “discuss the future direction of social media,” according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter’s board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company’s board, according a later securities filing. Dorsey is said to have told the board that “he and Mr. Musk were friends,” according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to “‘standstill’ provisions”,” according to the filing. This would effectively “limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.”\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,” Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company’s shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo. From Twitter\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. “I believe this is for the best,” Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company – and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and ‘unlock’ its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company’s closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company’s biggest shareholder.\n\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,” Musk writes in his offer letter. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter’s board of directors adopts a “poison pill” provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt/Getty Images\n\nApril 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in financing\n\nMusk lines up $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions and one equity commitment letter from himself, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe billionaire also reveals that he has not received a formal response from Twitter a week after his acquisition offer. He said he is “seeking to negotiate” a definite acquisition agreement and “is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately” — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his “best and final” offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about “the future of civilization,” not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.

The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing.\n\nMay 6: Musk’s lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter’s annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk’s pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter’s subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company’s reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump’s account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter’s Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal ‘temporarily on hold’\n\nMusk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts. The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk’s announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. “Still committed to acquisition,” he wrote.\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter’s numbers and “picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.”\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter’s legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform’s sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n“Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,” wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money?” Musk asked. “This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal ‘cannot move forward.’ Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter “cannot move forward” until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is “20% fake/spam accounts” and suggests Twitter’s previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: “Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?” before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform’s numbers. “Hello @SECGov, anyone home?” Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.” Later, the company says it intends to “enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter’s head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is “actively resisting and thwarting his information rights” as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right “not to consummate the transaction” and “to terminate the merger agreement.”\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement. A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter’s top lawyer that the company is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n“For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to ‘make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform,’” the letter reads. “This information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. … Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.”\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n“The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,” Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. “We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has “disdain” for the company, and at another saying, “Musk’s strategy is … a model of bad faith” — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter’s board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter’s lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter’s favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk’s legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter’s legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the “harm” to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the “drop dead” date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former head of security at Twitter, is sworn-in as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on data security at Twitter, on Capitol Hill, September 13, 2022 in Washington, DC. Zatko claims that Twitter's widespread security failures pose a security risk to user's privacy and information and could potentially endanger national security. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nSeptember 13: Whistleblower testifies before Congress\n\nTwitter whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko testifies before Congress in his first public appearance after his bombshell allegations against the social media company were reported in August by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nIn a whistleblower disclosure sent to multiple lawmakers and government agencies in July, Zatko accused Twitter of failing to safeguard users’ personal information and of exposing the most sensitive parts of its operation to too many people, including potentially to foreign spies. Zatko — who was Twitter’s head of security from November 2020 until he was fired in January — also alleged company executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, have deliberately misled regulators and the company’s own board about its shortcomings.\n\nZatko claimed in his testimony that Twitter is extremely vulnerable to being penetrated and exploited by agents of foreign governments, as well as detailed some of the personal information Twitter collects on users and alleged that the company does not know where the majority of its collected data goes.\n\nDays earlier, a judge allowed Musk’s legal team to add arguments based on the whistleblower disclosure to its case.\n\nOctober 3: Musk wants Twitter at the full price?\n\nMusk sends a letter to Twitter proposing to complete the deal as originally signed for $54.20 per share, citing people familiar with the negotiations. News of the letter, revealed in a security filing the next day, sends Twitter stock surging more than 20%, approaching the deal price for the first time in months.\n\nSuch an agreement could bring to an end a contentious, months-long back and forth between Musk and Twitter that has caused massive uncertainty for employees, investors and users of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nOctober 6: The clock is officially ticking\n\nMusk has until October 28 to close his acquisition of Twitter or face a trial that was previously delayed to allow both parties to close the deal, Judge McCormick rules.\n\n“If the transaction does not close by 5 p.m. on October 28, 2022, the parties are instructed to contact me by email that evening to obtain November 2022 trial dates,” the judge said in the order.\n\nOctober 27: Elon now owns Twitter\n\nMusk completes his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, according to a source familiar with the matter. Musk immediately fired Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to sources.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet saying, “the bird is freed.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: The corporate bond sell-off isn't as scary as it ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nFears of a recession and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes have pushed investors to dump corporate debt in recent weeks. The sell-off hasn’t gotten as much attention as the bleeding in stocks or cryptocurrencies, but it’s been painful.\n\nWhat’s happening: A major exchange-traded fund that tracks blue chip bonds from top-rated companies is down almost 18% year-to-date. So-called “junk” bonds issued by less creditworthy firms are 16% lower.\n\nWhen traders offload corporate bonds, an unsettling question often arises: Are they worried that companies could fail to meet their debt obligations?\n\nA string of defaults that drags down the economy and generates market turbulence could turn into a big problem. But that’s not exactly what bond markets are signalling now.\n\n“It basically looks worse than it is,” Fraser Lundie, head of fixed income for public markets at Federated Hermes, told me.\n\nBreaking it down: Some of the sell-off in corporate bonds has been driven by recession expectations, which would likely push up the number of defaults. In a downturn, some businesses would see revenue dry up, making it harder to cover other costs. Rising interest rates could also create headaches.\n\nBut a more technical factor is also at play. Government bond yields, which move opposite prices, have been rising as surging inflation is met by a more hawkish Fed. That makes corporate bonds — which typically have appeal in part because they have higher yields — look less enticing, especially when Wall Street is in selling mode.\n\nCorporate defaults are expected to climb through the beginning of 2023, according to S&P Global Ratings. The credit rating agency expects a key default rate to rise to 3% by next March, up from 1.4% the previous year.\n\n“You’d think it would start picking up in the next three months,” said S&P analyst Nick Kraemer.\n\nStill, those who trade corporate bonds aren’t overly anxious, even if they agree a recession is on the cards.\n\nThat’s because companies are in better shape than they were during the early days of the pandemic. They took advantage of rock-bottom borrowing costs over the past two years to stash cash and took steps to refinance their debt, which they now have more time to repay.\n\n“Generally, corporate balance sheets are in a good place, and there’s only a very small number of corporates that need to refinance,” Tom Ross, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, told me.\n\nThis will allow companies to absorb the effects of rising rates over a longer period, lessening the shock.\n\n“If rates stay high for long period, higher interest costs will bite. But they’re not going to bite for a long time yet,” Ross said.\n\nPlus, companies have been lavishing shareholders with stock buybacks and higher dividends during the recovery from the pandemic. If they really need to, they can use that money to cover debt costs instead, according to Lundie.\n\n“They can turn that off really quickly if they wanted to or if they needed to, and divert that money to paying down debt,” he said.\n\nBiden’s gas tax holiday wouldn’t change much\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday called on Congress to suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes until the end of September, framing the move as necessary to provide relief to American consumers — while acknowledging it would not solve the problem of surging energy prices.\n\n“We can bring down the price of gas and give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said in a speech from the White House.\n\nNot so fast: The proposal — which is viewed skeptically by leading economists — almost certainly won’t make it through Congress.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama once dismissed the tactic as a gimmick. Even if savings from lifting taxes were passed directly to consumers — which isn’t guaranteed — they may only amount to a few dollars for one fill-up.\n\nPlus, suspending the federal gas tax could ultimately stoke demand for fuel. That would only further strain limited supply.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped short of endorsing the plan in a statement after Biden’s remarks.\n\n“We will see where the consensus lies on a path forward for the president’s proposal in the House and the Senate,” she said.\n\nBut it’s the latest sign that the Biden administration views inflation as a serious political problem, especially in the run-up to elections in November.\n\nThe numbers: The average price of a gallon of regular gas in the United States dropped below $5 a gallon again this week, giving drivers a bit of breathing room.\n\n“The recent high prices may have led to a small drop in domestic gasoline demand as fewer drivers fueled up last week,” said AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross. Global oil prices have also dropped as recession fears rise.\n\nRevlon’s stock surges after bankruptcy\n\nBankruptcy isn’t scaring off hordes of armchair traders. In fact, it seems to be luring them in.\n\nShares of makeup company Revlon have skyrocketed more than 300% over the past three trading sessions — jumping from about $2 to more than $8 — after falling 13% on the day it announced its Chapter 11 reorganization plan.\n\nAnalysts at Vanda Research told clients that a spike in chatter on social media and the prevalence of riskier options trading— a trademark among the Reddit cohort — “confirm that retail crowds are behind the latest moves higher.”\n\nThe surge is eerily reminiscent of what played out with Hertz in 2020. After the rental car company filed for bankruptcy, shares soared. The move was accompanied by cheering from traders on Reddit, who were betting against short sellers that thought Hertz stock would continue to fall.\n\nShort sellers have also been circling Revlon, which may have caught retail traders’ attention, Vanda’s team said.\n\nA note of caution: When a company declares bankruptcy, most investors are hung out to dry. Bondholders and other creditors are often first in line to get back some of their money. Holders of the stock typically don’t stand to benefit, and their investments are wiped out if new shares are issued.\n\nUp next\n\nAccenture, Darden Restaurants and Rite Aid report results before US markets open.

{"question_id": "20230428_9", "search_time": "2023/05/25/04:57", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/13/world-leaders-celebrities-athletes-death/94676192/", "title": "Deaths of these famous faces stunned world in 2016", "text": "Compiled by Jessica Durando, USA TODAY\n\nTheir lives were filled with unparalleled accomplishments, fame and some tough times to overcome.\n\nTake a look back in memoriam of 16 world leaders, celebrities, athletes and other notables who died in 2016:\n\nMuhammad Ali (Jan. 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016)\n\nMuhammad Ali was widely hailed as the greatest heavyweight boxer in the sport’s history. Born Cassius Clay, Ali changed to a Muslim name and refused, on religious grounds, to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. His opposition to the war cost him the belt and led to a three-year ban from boxing. His conviction for dodging the draft was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1971.\n\nAli's prowess in the ring and his personality and social activism make him one of the most recognizable sports figures of the last century. He secured an Olympic gold medal in the 1960 Summer Games and became one of the youngest heavyweight champions of all time, stunning the boxing world with a knockout of Sonny Liston to claim the title in 1964 at age 22.\n\n30 of Muhammad Ali's best quotes\n\nIt marked the first of three times Ali would win the heavyweight title. He became the only heavyweight to win the crown on three occasions. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 with a 56-5 record, three of the losses coming in his final four fights. He had 37 knockouts. After his retirement, he concentrated on philanthropy and social activism. He died of medical complications related to Parkinson's disease at age 74.\n\nDavid Bowie (Jan. 8, 1947 - Jan. 10, 2016)\n\nBowie was a transformative figure and an ever-evolving one, a shape-shifter who remained constant in his dedication to exploring, and defining, new forms of expression.\n\nOn tour and through his music, the legendary singer slipped in and out of various personas and alter egos: most famously, the androgynous Ziggy Stardust, eccentric Aladdin Sane and drug-fueled The Thin White Duke, created during his mid-'70s Young Americans era. After hitting critical and commercial highs in the 1980s with albums such as Tonight and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), Bowie continued to reinvent himself artistically to varying degrees of success.\n\nFrom Bowie to Prince, America lost some great musicians in 2016\n\nUnlike many of the myriad performers he influenced — among them female superstars such as Madonna and Lady Gaga — Bowie remained an elusive figure, as private in personal matters as he was charismatic as an entertainer. By turns androgynous and dapper, rugged and ethereal, he kept admirers guessing in a way that would be unimaginable for an icon coming up in the age of social media. He died of cancer just days after his 69th birthday.\n\nFidel Castro (Aug. 13, 1926 - Nov. 25, 2016)\n\nDuring his nearly half-century in power, Fidel Castro helped bring the world to the brink of nuclear war, tormented 11 American presidents and exerted almost total control over the last remaining communist government in the Western Hemisphere. Few other world leaders in history could boast the longevity or influence of the iconic bearded, cigar-chewing Cuban dictator.\n\nFor 47 years, Castro maintained his grip over the island nation by forging close bonds with the Soviet Union, Venezuela and China, inspiring a wave of anti-American leaders throughout Latin America along the way. Despite years of economic difficulties following the fall of the Soviet Union, Castro still held extraordinary sway over many of his people. “Fidelismo,” or a kind of personality cult around Castro, managed to survive. Raúl Castro succeeded his older brother as Cuban president in 2008. After years of failing health, Fidel Castro died at age 90.\n\nPatty Duke (Dec. 14, 1946 - March 29, 2016)\n\nPatty Duke, who died at age 69, will be remembered as the teen who won an Oscar for The Miracle Worker and later played \"identical cousins\" in her own TV sitcom.\n\nDuke won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the blind-and-deaf American icon Helen Keller, first on stage and later in the 1962 film, both of which told the story of how Keller learned to communicate as a child through her tutor Anne Sullivan (Anne Bancroft).\n\nBut Duke really charmed her way into American pop culture in 1963, when she was given her own series.\n\nThe Patty Duke Show, which ran from 1963 to 1966, was hard work: She played both characters, Patricia \"Patty\" Lane, a \"typical\" rock 'n roll American teenager who occasionally got into minor trouble at school and home, and Catherine \"Cathy\" Lane, her more well-behaved cousin from Scotland who adores \"a minuet, the Ballet Russes and Crepe Suzette.\"\n\nAcclaimed for her acting (her career dates back to the late 1950s), Duke became known in later life as an advocate for mental health issues, after she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982 and wrote about it in her 1987 autobiography.\n\nBesides appearing on stage and screen, Duke even had success as a singer, with two Top 40 hits in 1965, Don't Just Stand There and Say Something Funny. She also wrote two books, Call Me Anna, and Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic Depressive Illness. And she served as president of the actors union, the Screen Actors Guild, from 1983 to 1988.\n\nCarrie Fisher (Oct. 21, 1956 - Dec. 27, 2016)\n\nCarrie Fisher, the princess of Hollywood who became a young star playing a princess in Star Wars, died after a heart attack suffered on a flight from London to Los Angeles. Fisher was 60.\n\nThe actress and author had been on tour to promote her latest memoir, The Princess Diarist, based on the diaries she kept as a 19-year-old shooting what is arguably the biggest movie of all time, 1977's Star Wars, playing Rebel Alliance leader Princess Leia Organa, she of the famous double-bun hairstyle.\n\nHer books, whether novels or memoirs, were funny, sharp and revealing. Among other things, her latest revealed her brief affair with co-star Harrison Ford, who was 14 years older and married with kids when they made Star Wars. She was also an outspoken advocate for mental illness, having told the world that she was bipolar.\n\nThroughout her up-and-down movie career, she remained a product of Hollywood who could step back and explain its history and rituals to the outsiders, always ready with a caustic comment or pointed joke.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor (Feb. 6, 1917 - Dec. 18, 2016)\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor, 99, the former beauty queen and actress, was ahead of her time. In the Hollywood Golden Age, Gabor, or simply Zsa Zsa to most, was perhaps the first celebutante.\n\nAlthough after her television career Gabor had become a punchline or a caricature, known for her run-in with a Beverly Hills cop or for her many marriages, it wasn’t always that way. Gabor was of a time when “socialite” was not yet a term of derision.\n\nDespite a spotty film career, she became a staple on TV. She often appeared as herself and spoofed her active social life with a quip and a “dahlink” that became her signature term of endearment.\n\nShe was glamorous, quick-witted and not afraid to make fun of herself or her nine marriages (including to Conrad Hilton, Paris Hilton’s great-grandfather), seven divorces and one annulment.\n\nJohn Glenn (July 18, 1921 - Dec. 8, 2016)\n\nJohn Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, and later a four-term U.S. senator from Ohio, died at age 95.\n\nTo understand why John Glenn became so important in America, it is important to remember how badly the United States was losing the space race in the early 1960s. The Soviet Union had pulled ahead in this Cold War battle when it launched Sputnik, the first man-made object to be placed into orbit. It then made a mockery of the American program by sending the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit. Then the Soviets sent a second cosmonaut into orbit.\n\nSo all of America was watching at 9:47 in the morning on Feb. 20, 1962. Sitting in the cramped quarters of the Friendship 7 spacecraft, Glenn took off from Cape Canaveral. Scott Carpenter, the backup astronaut for the mission, famously said: “Godspeed, John Glenn.”\n\nAstronaut Glenn climbed into space, circled the globe three times, and then dropped down into the Atlantic Ocean. The flight took all of 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds, but it changed the space race and restored American pride.\n\nFlorence Henderson (Feb. 14, 1934 - Nov. 24, 2016)\n\nAlthough her best-known role as the cheerful matriarch of The Brady Bunch ran for only five seasons, it lived on in syndication for decades, cementing Florence Henderson's status as one of TV's most beloved moms.\n\nThere were spinoffs and reunion specials like 1977's The Brady Bunch Hour, 1981's The Brady Brides and The Bradys in 1990, a Fuller House-style outing that featured the marriages and families of the six grown Brady children. She also joined the cast of the 1995 spoof The Brady Bunch Movie, playing Grandma Brady opposite Cheers star Shelley Long as Carol.\n\nAs her TV career blossomed with The Brady Bunch, Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host The Tonight Show for the vacationing Johnny Carson.\n\nAfter The Brady Bunch ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including Hart to Hart, Fantasy Island and The Love Boat.\n\nIn later years she made guest appearances on such shows as Roseanne, Ally McBeal and The King of Queens. Henderson died at age 82.\n\nGwen Ifill (Sept. 29, 1955 - Nov. 14, 2016)\n\nKnown as a trailblazer in many ways, Gwen Ifill was one of the nation's most prominent journalists. She worked as moderator and managing editor of Washington Week, a weekly political discussion television show. Ifill was also managing editor of PBS NewsHour, an hour-long evening newscast she co-anchored with Judy Woodruff. In 2009, she also wrote a book about President Obama, The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.\n\nIfill covered seven presidential campaigns in her career and was the first African-American female journalist to moderate a vice-presidential debate. In 2004, she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and the 2008 debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. She died at age 61 after several months of cancer treatment.\n\nHarper Lee (April 28, 1926 - Feb. 19, 2016)\n\nNelle Harper Lee grew up to write one of the 20th century's most culture-changing novels: To Kill a Mockingbird. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has sold more than 30 million copies in English, remains in print (selling more than a million copies a year) and in every school in America, and, until last year, was her only book.\n\nAfter Mockingbird was published, after the Oscar-winning movie starring Gregory Peck came out in 1962, Lee stopped talking to the press, went home to Monroeville, Ala., and closed her door. She kept it closed for decades, emerging only occasionally to write something for Oprah Winfrey's magazine, or to receive the 2007 Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in the White House.\n\nAfter years of being left alone, Lee was catapulted back into the public eye in 2015 with the release of Go Set a Watchman, a “newly discovered” novel she wrote in the 1950s and only the second book from her. The controversy over the novel, and worldwide publicity over the re-emergence of the elderly writer, made Watchman an instant best seller. Lee died at age 89.\n\nGeorge Michael ( July 25, 1963 - Dec. 25, 2016)\n\nGeorge Michael, the British singer, musician and founding member of Wham!, died over the Christmas holiday. He was 53.\n\nMichael sold more than 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy Awards, and recorded duets with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and John, among others.\n\nFew teen idols have made critics eat their words more handily than Michael did back in his late-’80s heyday, when the former Wham! frontman emerged as one of the most successful and admired singer/songwriters of that decade. But in the years that followed, Michael made news more frequently for his professional struggles and personal scandal, even as he continued to record and tour profitably and inspire younger acts.\n\nArnold Palmer (Sept. 10, 1929 - Sept. 25, 2016)\n\nArnold Palmer became one of the best known sports figures. He was a telegenic golfer who burst out of black-and-white television sets in the late 1950s and into the 1960s and took the game to the masses.\n\nPalmer, who died at age 87, was the accessible common man who became one of the sport's best players, as well as a successful businessman, philanthropist, trailblazing advertising spokesman, talented golf course designer and experienced aviator.\n\nPalmer won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average on the PGA Tour four times, played on six Ryder Cup teams and was captain twice.\n\nHe received virtually every national award in golf and was the \"Athlete of the Decade\" for the 1960s in a national Associated Press poll. Palmer, who helped found the Golf Channel decades later, also helped usher in the Champions Tour, where he won 10 times, including five majors.\n\nPrince (June 7, 1958 - April 21, 2016)\n\nLike all great artists, Prince was himself a synthesizer of influences; his ranged from Sly Stone to Joni Mitchell to Todd Rundgren.\n\nThe music he produced as a result — as a singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist — defied genre, blending a mastery of pop hooks and funk grooves on singles that could be as lush as the gospel-tinged Purple Rain, as muscular and rocking as Let's Go Crazy and as ferociously propulsive as When Doves Cry — and that was just on one album, 1984's commercial behemoth Purple Rain.\n\nPrince, a 2004 Rock Hall of Fame inductee, won seven Grammy Awards. He also won a best-original-song Oscar for his 1984 film Purple Rain.\n\nMore recently, the social consciousness that had figured into his music became prominent. His 2015 song Baltimore responded to the death of Freddie Gray and related, racially charged events with a defiantly positive spirit. The prodigy and provocateur died at age 57 at his Paisley Park compound in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen.\n\nNancy Reagan (July 6, 1921 - March 6, 2016)\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan will be remembered as the indispensable partner and protector of the Ronald Reagan, the nation's 40th president, who became a fierce advocate in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAfter the frugal Carter years of turned-down thermostats and cardigan sweaters, Nancy Reagan moved into the White House determined, as she later wrote, \"to reclaim some of the stature and dignity of the building.\"\n\nThe first lady raised money to renovate the executive mansion, which had grown shabby. She ordered the first complete set of White House china since the Truman administration. She hosted lavish parties and 57 state dinners, inviting old Hollywood pals like Frank Sinatra and close friend Merv Griffin. Top fashion designers like Halston, Adolfo and Galanos provided her size 4 evening gowns, often in her signature \"Reagan Red.\"\n\nFirst take: Nancy Reagan was a huge influence on her husband's presidency\n\nAfter a second term that saw the president survive colon cancer surgery and the first lady undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer, the Reagans retired to their California ranch. When she watched her soulmate taken \"to a distant place where I can no longer reach him,\" Nancy Reagan spoke out in favor of embryonic stem cell research and its promise in treating Alzheimer's. That put her at odds with many, including President George W. Bush, in what had become \"the party of Reagan.\" She died at age 94, nearly a dozen years after her husband passed away.\n\nJanet Reno (July 21, 1938 - Nov. 7, 2016)\n\nJanet Reno, who died at age 78, was the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general. Her tenure spanned some of the most tumultuous periods in American life.\n\nThe second-longest serving attorney general in history, Reno’s Justice Department was thrust into a nearly unending series of tests, from the government’s deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, and the first World Trade Center attack investigation to the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the international custody battle for a Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez.\n\nHer improbable political survival during a grueling eight years in office, while also battling Parkinson’s disease, may be the most striking aspect of her tenure.\n\nReno's quiet, no-nonsense manner ultimately was celebrated with a regular parody on Saturday Night Live, called “Janet Reno’s Dance Party.’’ The skit featured Will Ferrell, dressed in a Reno standard royal blue dress and pearls. She embraced the parody and joined the cast to share in the fun.\n\nReno, who unsuccessfully ran for Florida governor in 2002, never enjoyed dealing with reporters, though when she did it often featured references to her deceased mother, Jane Reno, known as a coarse character who built the family home at the edge of the Florida Everglades.\n\nAsked once how her mother would assess her performance as attorney general, Reno said: \"After scoffing, she would have said she was very, very proud of me.\"\n\nDebbie Reynolds (April 1, 1932 - Dec. 28, 2016)\n\nDebbie Reynolds' celebrated career in Hollywood lasted more than 65 years. The Oscar-nominated actress starred in memorable films including 1952's Singin' in the Rain, 1962's How the West Was Won and 1956's Bundle of Joy.\n\nThe outspoken Reynolds made a specialty playing offbeat mothers onscreen, alongside Albert Brooks in 1996's Mother and on the sitcom Will & Grace (1999 to 2006) as Debra Messing's screen mom.\n\nBut the most famous is her true-life role as Carrie Fisher's mother, the subject of Fisher's semi-autobiographical novel and 1990 film Postcards From the Edge. Reynolds, who was 84, died a day after her daughter Carrie passed away.\n\n\"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,\" Reynolds' son, Todd Fisher, said from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nAntonin Scalia (March 11, 1936 - Feb. 13, 2016)\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the loquacious leader of the Supreme Court's conservative bloc and a leading force in American life for three decades.\n\nScalia's sharp intellect and acerbic opinions made him a hero to conservatives and a target for liberals. Yet he also was a close friend to a leader of the court's liberal wing, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe first Italian-American to serve on the court when he was named by President Reagan in 1986, “Nino” Scalia established himself as a firm opponent of abortion, gay rights and racial preferences.\n\nDuring his three decades on the court, Scalia managed to steer the federal judiciary toward his twin theories of “originalism” and “textualism” — strictly reading the Constitution and federal statutes to mean what their authors intended, and nothing more. He died at age 79.\n\nPat Summitt (June 14, 1952 - June 28, 2016)\n\nLegendary coach Pat Summitt won more games than anyone in college basketball history.\n\nThe Tennessee native drew upon her early experiences of learning to expect the most out of herself as a guidepost to her coaching career.\n\nThe coach who never had a losing record in 38 seasons, shocked the sports world in May 2011 when she announced she would continue at the University of Tennessee despite the diagnosis of early onset dementia, Alzheimer's type.\n\nPresident Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, recognized, with the Congressional Gold Medal, as the nation’s highest civilian awards. She died at age 64.\n\nAlan Thicke (March 1, 1947 - Dec. 13, 2016)\n\nAlan Thicke achieved widespread fame as Dr. Jason Seaver on the 1980s ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing the psychiatrist dad opposite Joanna Kerns.\n\nAside from his popular '80s patriarch, Thicke also had a career as a game show host and songwriter, composing memorable theme songs for classic shows including Diff’rent Strokes, The Facts of Life and Wheel of Fortune.\n\nHe was nominated for three Emmy Awards for TV-show writing in the 1970s and nominated for a Golden Globe award for Growing Pains in 1988. The Ontario-born actor, 69, died after suffering a heart attack.\n\nElie Wiesel (Sept. 30, 1928 - July 2, 2016)\n\nElie Wiesel made Holocaust education his mission in life after surviving the Auschwitz and Buchenwald death camps.\n\nThe Wiesel family was deported in 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where Elie, 15, was separated from his mother and sisters.\n\nHe managed to stay with his father for most of World War II as they worked at an Auschwitz sub-camp and were transferred to the Buchenwald camp in Germany in early 1945. But his father died just weeks short of that camp's liberation. His mother and younger sister also did not survive.\n\nSome 11 years after leaving Buchenwald, he wrote Un di Velt Hot Geshvign (And the World Remained Silent), a Yiddish memoir that would become known as Night and be translated into 30 languages. He opted not to let Hollywood touch his book.\n\nIn 1978, Jimmy Carter selected Wiesel to lead the President's Commission on the Holocaust, followed two years later by his appointment as chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. His work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. Wiesel died at age 87.\n\nGene Wilder (June 11, 1933 - Aug. 29, 2016)\n\nGene Wilder brought his deft comedic touch to such unforgettable roles as the charismatic candy man in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the obsessed scientist of Young Frankenstein.\n\nWilder left an indelible impression through his performances from Wonka to the boozy gunslinger in Blazing Saddles and, in later years, screwball roles in comedies including Silver Streak and Stir Crazy.\n\nEmotional Mel Brooks remembers Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein'\n\nBorn Jerome Silberman on Milwaukee's west side on June 11, 1933, Wilder started entertaining when he was 7 by performing to make his ailing mother laugh. Then he got interested in theater.\n\nThe role of nervous accountant Leo Bloom in Brooks' 1968 comedy The Producers — put Wilder in the front ranks of comic actors, and forever linked him with Mel Brooks. It also earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. In the 2000s, Wilder largely stopped acting, apart from some personal appearances, telling interviewers he'd lost the taste for the modern entertainment industry. He died at age 83.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/10/25/best-phoenix-restaurants/1448361002/", "title": "Phoenix restaurants: The ultimate guide to the best dining spots", "text": "Finding great restaurants in Phoenix isn’t hard. The hard part is choosing which to highlight.\n\n“Still,” I thought to myself, “if we go for broke and put together a massive list of 100 Phoenix restaurants you should try, there will be plenty of room for all of my favorites.”\n\nI couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nCompiling this list was as agonizing as it was exhilarating. I could have easily filled a list twice this size with places I love to eat, and deciding where and how to draw the line was torture.\n\nIn the end, though, I settled on one single criterion for deciding which restaurants to include: How excited I am for you to try them.\n\nI hope you find them as exciting as I do.\n\nAl-Hana at Baiz Market\n\nWe rightly lament the Valley’s lack of a grand food-market culture, but it’s worth remembering the spirit of the world’s grand markets is alive in Phoenix, albeit in smaller doses. There is a buzz about Baiz that can’t be faked, a feeling of community grounded in food, where Middle Eastern, Arabic and North African cultures come together. Al-Hana, the diminutive restaurant squeezed into a corner of Baiz, remains one of the city’s best spots to sample Arabic cuisine, a bustling place to catch a bite while taking a break from shopping for groceries. Breads are tender and steaming, topped with seasoned beef, spinach and cheese or a simple sprinkling of za’atar. Familiar mezze like baba ghannouj and hummus have an atypical richness (along with a proper helping of olive oil). Rotisserie-seared shawarma is juicy and gorgeously seasoned, piled atop rice or wrapped up with garlicky toum and pickled vegetables. Al-Hana might lack the polished efficiency of its contemporaries, but its pure flavor and energy cannot be denied.\n\nDetails: 523 N. 20th St., Phoenix.

If there’s one thing my readers seem to feel they lack, it’s meat-and-potatoes fare with a little Old-World charm. It’s here, but it can be a little hard to find, and All Pierogi kitchen is a standout. A no-frills Ukrainian mom-and-pop joint run by friendly folks, this is the go-to spot for pierogi, cabbage rolls and sausage. It’s distressing how many restaurants around town prepare this kind of food with the grace and dexterity of a drunken elephant, but that only makes it easier to appreciate a place that gets it right. Pierogi, whether boiled or pan-fried, are tender and flavorful; meat fillings have just the right texture and consistency; and sauces taste fresh and well-seasoned. Add a little soup, some vegetable salads, reasonable prices and you have some of the best Old-World cuisine in town.\n\nDetails: 1245 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-262-3349, allpierogi.com.\n\nAlzohour\n\nA meal at Alzohour is a long, lingering affair and that’s as much a matter of necessity as it is of design. Zhor Saad practically runs the restaurant by herself, which means dinner is outstanding, but it’s going to take a while. Unceremoniously tucked into a market and clothing store, Alzohour is a place where diners can drown in the sultry scent of Moroccan fare that’s equal parts bold and lusty. Arabic classics of variable quality round out the offerings, but the meat of the menu is in dishes like a silky, perfumed lamb tagine, meat dripping off the bone, heavy with saffron and spice. Couscous billows with steam, saturated with vegetables and topped with tender meats. Bastilla — a nutty ground chicken pie wrapped in crisp phyllo and dusted with cinnamon and sugar — is a mind-bending blend of savory and sweet. On the purely sweet end of the spectrum, Saad’s kunafeh is next level, almost custardy with a deep golden, crisp crust and a heavy dose of pistachio. Not all will appreciate the market-chic environment, but none of that matters when your host prepares everything with a warm heart and you’re lost in a saffron-scented cloud.\n\nDetails: 7814 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

When the Calabrian native tired of trying to please the white tablecloth crowd, he opened Andreoli, a casual neighborhood grocery with a few tables that serves some of the best traditional Italian fare in town. This culinary curmudgeon with an uncompromising vision is as likely to be in the front of house sipping espresso and watching soccer as he is to be in the back of house running the kitchen. His work is a devastating combination of simplicity, technique and killer ingredients that exposes the purveyors of oafish red sauce concoctions and pretentious, overworked modern Italian for the charlatans they are. Grab a loaf of craggy bread, order a perfect pasta or grilled seafood from the white board, snag some sticky cornetti marmelatta or crisp, layered sfogliatelle from the pastry case and consider yourself lucky that such a skilled Italian traditionalist calls Scottsdale home.\n\nDetails: 8880 E.

Sparingly decorated and showing its age, this strip-mall stalwart makes its impact on the plate; and a dual-menu system makes it the ideal place to ease neophytes into more traditional fare. The black-rimmed American menu features juicy pot stickers, crisp orange beef and sizzling pepper beef. But drift over to the red-rimmed traditional menu and the skies open. Meltaway duck is wrapped in a crisp taro crust; West Lake soup suspends gossamer threads of egg in a silky broth; braised tofu bubbles in a clay pot with sweet shrimp. And whole fish pulled live from the tank is buried in scallions and ginger and splashed with a bit of soy and shaoxing. Keep exploring, and when you’re ready for the stuffed duck feet, they’ll be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 9880 S. Rural Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-705-7486. Search \"Asian Hong Kong\" on Facebook.\n\nAtlas Bistro\n\nTodd Sawyer’s restaurant is a chameleon. Quiet and unassuming, hidden in a strip mall on the fringes of the Old Town spotlight, it changes its colors through the years as chefs come and go. It’s also one of the most reliably excellent restaurants in the Valley — a BYOB, to boot — that has never been better than it is under the auspices of chef Cory Oppold. The stark antithesis of flashy downtown Scottsdale just a few blocks to the north, Atlas Bistro piggybacks on AZ Wine Company, an intimate room with minimal decor and sound-deadening walls. While the setting is modest, the plates are filled with pyrotechnics, showy but thoughtful multi-component affairs that nimbly merge disparate flavors and techniques to compelling effect. Think slivers of tender beef tongue pastrami with a honey mustard emulsion; kombu-marinated black cod with yerba mate béarnaise; or a goat cheese mousse spiked with Jidori chicken skin crisps and poached cranberries. Wine geeks love the capable bottle service and, as a bonus, Oppold’s vegetarian creations are some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 2515 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

The Osmic family first opened Balkan Bakery a decade ago, and while a short list of common baked goods and sweets are solid offerings, it’s the Bosnian specialties that make Balkan Bakery a destination. Aldijana prepares the cevapi, seasoning and stuffing the little sausages in preparation for the grill, where they take on a crisp char. Her brother, Jasenko, handles the stuffed breads, stretching a thin layer of dough over the prep table, stuffing and rolling it into a tube and, with a quick flick of his wrist, curling it into a tight swirl the size of a lunch plate. Stuffed with meat (burek), cheese (sirnica) or spinach (zeljanica), it’s divine, contrasting a light, crisp shell with a steaming, tender, layered interior.\n\nDetails: 1107 E. Bell Road, Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-996-4598, facebook.com/BalkanBakery.\n\nBar Pesce\n\nBeginnings don’t come much humbler than a counter at the Steven Paul Salon, but Cullen Campbell’s evolution from goofy genius behind one of the Valley’s all-time zaniest guerilla operations into one of its most vibrant, alluring and sure-handed chefs is a testament to his culinary acumen. At Bar Pesce — the recently refreshed moniker for what used to be Crudo — Italy may be the inspiration, but this born-and-bred Southerner is after something a little more lusty, weaving crudi, composed cheese plates and succulent meats from smoke and olive oil and acid. Uni is dressed with shaved shallot and avocado, while bottarga and i’itoi onions give sweet raw yellowtail a salty, spicy sting. Burrata is amped up with an unctuous pancetta vinaigrette; and ricotta is simply paired with walnuts and desert honey. Meltaway semolina gnocchi drown in a succulent lamb neck sugo, while lamb belly gently braises in milk and mirepoix. Even when Campbell’s flavors are light, they’re distilled down to a knee-buckling, vivid intensity. And the modest prices on the prix fixe aren’t a mistake — not only is this one of the best restaurants in town, it’s also one of the best bargains.\n\nDetails: 3603 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-358-8666, barpesce.com.\n\nBarrio Cafe\n\nSilvana Salcido Esparza was hardly a timid wallflower to begin with, but she set off a technicolor bomb of sass, graffiti and regional Mexican flavor on 16th Street when she opened Barrio Café in 2002. Not to knock Sonora, but Mexico is a big country and most of its cuisine is still brutally underrepresented in Phoenix. Barrio Café gives the central and southern Mexican states a local voice. Cochinita pibil — pork steamed in achiote and sour orange — sneaks up from Yucatan. Puebla’s symbol of national pride, chiles en nogada, are stuffed with a chunky, fruit-laced picadillo and drenched in almond cream. The moles of Oaxaca — from a dark and smoky mole negro to the herbal, pungent pipian verde — are gorgeously complex. The kitchen throws caution to the wind, more concerned with dropping flavor bomb after flavor bomb than dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s. Fun-loving, sometimes irreverent servers are the antithesis of the standard-issue scripted corporate dullards.\n\nDetails: 2814 N. 16th St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-636-0240, barriocafe.com.\n\nBarrio Cafe Gran Reserva\n\nIf Barrio Café is where Silvana Salcido Esparza slings unbridled, brash flavor, Gran Reserva is where she takes that burst of energy and focuses it to pinpoint intensity. Tucked into a tiny wedge of a dining room with a wraparound view of Grand Avenue, Gran Reserva is Barrio Café’s elegant cousin, draped in white tablecloths and colorful trompe l’oeil. An a la carte menu rehashes many of Barrio Café’s greatest hits, but Gran Reserva’s mission is revealed in the menu de degustación, where Mexican fare reaches levels of refinement not seen elsewhere in the Valley. Sous vide duck meets sultry cranberry mole; suckling pig confit is treated with chile de arbol demiglace; and a cap of lime foam and queso Oaxaqueño sits half melted, wrapped in fragrant hoja santa with a touch of chile and peanut oil. The best part? At less than $50, the degustación menu is priced for the people, and a bevy of vegan dishes make Gran Reserva a viable option for anyone.\n\nDetails: 1301 W. Grand Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-252-2777, barriocafe.com.\n\nBinkley's\n\nKevin Binkley is a titan of the Phoenix food scene who climbed to the top of the mountain and decided he hated the view. He achieved the dream of a local restaurant group with enough concepts to make some coin but not so many that he had to sacrifice his integrity. But Binkley shut it all down for one reason: He isn’t a restaurateur and he desperately missed the kitchen. Now, the celebrated chef with obsessive focus and puckish tendencies has turned a Phoenix bungalow into his personal culinary playground — and everyone is invited. Fine dining has never been so welcoming, like a private dinner party that starts with a series of modernist amuses on the veranda; moves into the bar for snacks like grilled soppressata chips and confit duck wings; and ends in the dining room with coddled goose eggs, sweet pea agnolotti and whole roasted lamb. There is no fourth wall here (literally). Roll up your sleeves, step into the open kitchen and lend a hand. There’s plenty of joy to go around.\n\nDetails: 2320 E. Osborn Road, Phoenix.

But its sneaky, under the radar bar bites deserve their fair share of attention, too. Bob Tam’s menu — an irreverent foil for Ross Simon’s encyclopedic cocktail list — isn’t meant to be taken too seriously, but Tam’s puckish Asian fusion creations reveal his deep understanding of the underlying cuisines. The Angry Panda wraps crisp peanuts, chiles and dried anchovies in cool lettuce leaves with fresh herbs. Seoul fried chicken gets a sweet and spicy lift from watermelon kimchi with a dab of sesame ranch. Chinese buns are filled with deeply caramelized chunks of pork belly, a throwback to Tam’s days at San Francisco’s Betelnut. The Dragon Dumpling Burger is a juicy beef and pork concoction that channels the spirit of xiaolongbao into a burger slathered with mayo and Sichuan pickles, complete with dipping sauce. Best part? It all goes well with booze.\n\nDetails: Luhrs Building, 1 W. Jefferson St., Phoenix.

Under the auspices of celebrity chef Michael Mina and executive chef Sara Garrant, the flagship restaurant at Fairmont Scottsdale Princess sports a contemporary elegance and refinement. If you’re looking for a dry-aged tomahawk rib eye, they’ve got you covered. But the offerings also drift into esoterica, such as a butter-poached Snake River Farms rib eye cap that’s so tender and sweet it’s almost like a different animal altogether. If you really want to go big, the roster is deep with domestic and imported premium beef that runs up to $45 per ounce. Excellent sauces abound and sides show a penchant for Asian flavors, like mushrooms plied with white soy and mirin; or a dynamite short rib fried rice with kimchi and chunks of sweet Chinese sausage. It has the luxury prices to match, but, put simply, Bourbon Steak is operating at a higher plane than the rest of the pack.\n\nDetails: Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 E. Princess Drive.

But the Pua family came to the rescue in 2015 and still stands tall as the lone ambassador for Malaysian cuisine. Thankfully, it’s a charming, casual little spot with an extensive menu filled with dishes unobtainable anywhere else in town. Batter-dipped chicken wings are fried to a shattering crisp and served with two spicy-sweet sambals — the “mama” and the “papa.” Roti canai pairs thick, oily flatbread with a rich coconut-based curry sauce for dipping and slurping. Laksa — the iconic Malaysian soup that takes many forms — is done here as a rich and fragrant coconut and lemongrass broth with noodles, seafood and bean sprouts. Sweet, steamed Hainan chicken is paired with rich, oil-splashed rice. And char kway teow — a universal crowd-pleaser — is a warm and steaming stir-fry of thick rice noodles in a sweet and comforting soy-based sauce.\n\nDetails: 1845 E. Broadway Road, Tempe.

Jamaican food is hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop fare, a quarter of fiery jerk chicken or slippery stewed oxtails ladled into a to-go container with rice, beans and plantains, right? But island cuisine can bring an air of refinement just like any other, and here’s the proof. Jamaican-born rum savant Dwayne Allen takes a deep dive into his spirit of choice, slinging educational flights and stellar cocktails in the dark and cozy Rum Bar. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Danielle Leoni has adopted the flavor and fire of her husband’s homeland, leading a kitchen that puts Jamaican fare in a context rarely seen in the States. Scallops seared in cast iron get a splash of Appleton rum for a sweet, rich glaze, while vinegary sauteed shrimp explode with cayenne and habanero. Pan-fried escovitch fish is buried under a pile of sultry vegetables. And Leoni’s house jerk — whatever it seasons — pulls no punches, an uncompromising blend of vinegar, spices, chiles and herbs that is as flavorful as it is incendiary.\n\nDetails: 108 E. Pierce St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-267-1266, thebreadfruit.com.\n\nBri\n\nYoung, upstart chefs who launch shoestring operations where they can experiment and play are vital to any serious dining scene. Vince Mellody is playing that part at one of the Valley’s more quirky and delicious recent openings. Housed in a decidedly chill Coronado bungalow without a hint of pretention or ego, Bri (rhymes with pie) slings an ever-changing collection of small, creative plates, most of them forged in a South African-style grill over live coals. The room is comfortable and Mellody’s food is on point. But Bri’s greatest asset, perhaps, is a menu that’s almost pointedly out of lockstep with its contemporaries. Frico caldo, Italian pan-fried cheese and potato cakes, sport a gorgeous lacy crisp and a dollop of tomato relish. Tender, charred pork ribs are laced with fermented black beans and crisped shallots, while slow-roasted duck breast gets a topping of crisp chile sauce. A pureed Persian salad called bademjan employs eggplant to devastating effect, charred jet-black to lend a little bitterness and a ton of depth.\n\nDetails: 2221 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

Truth is, Buddyz makes a better deep dish than most of the joints back home, and I include the big, beloved goons like Lou Malnati’s, Giordano’s and Gino’s East. All of which is to say that somebody has to sing the praises of this place. A recent expansion effort has brought Buddyz out of the pastures of Queen Creek, which is a good thing; it was flying under the radar for too long and there’s nobody who doesn’t need this in their life. A thick, crunchy crust gets a none-too-subtle (but not overwhelming) puddle of melty cheese and a crown of bright, chunky tomato sauce, seasoned just so and spruced up with the requisite punch of dried herbs. Equal parts dinner and architecture, it’s a gooey, hedonistic mess. Deep dish isn’t pizza? It’s a casserole, you say? Call it whatever you want, tough guy. Now shut up, eat it and then tell me to my face that it didn’t taste good.\n\nDetails: 18423 E. San Tan Blvd., Queen Creek. MAP IT! 480-822-1225.

Sun Johnson, who was born and raised in Korea, teamed up with Nick Rocha to open a Korean restaurant that’s a rarity in the Valley. Why? It doesn’t act as though Korean cuisine is exclusively about grilled meat. Forget the tabletop grill. Ga Hyang doesn’t have them — it doesn’t need them. Start with duk boki, a mix of chewy rice cakes and tender fish cakes, swimming in a bath of pure onion and chile fire. Follow with haemul pajeon, a thick, crisp pancake stuffed with sweet scallions and seafood of all manner. When it’s a furnace outside, take refuge in mul naeng myun, slippery noodles with beef brisket and slivers of crisp, fresh fruit in a mustard-spiked beef broth that is literally iced over. Or warm yourself with a pure, milky sul long tang, slow-simmered from beef bones. The best thing here comes free of charge. Johnson’s banchan — the collection of pickled, marinated and fermented little dishes that accompany the meal — run circles around every other Korean restaurant in town. Nobody even comes close.\n\nDetails: 4362 W. Olive Ave., Glendale. MAP IT! 623-937-8550.

That’s no less true of the original Carolina’s near downtown Phoenix, where some dishes are better than others. But what Carolina’s does right is very, very right, and a diverse crowd that seems to represent the entire city comes down every day to take part in it. If we’re being honest, Carolina’s is a decrepit hole in the wall with little more than folding tables and chairs and a couple of soda machines. But what comes out of the kitchen is nothing less than the soul of Phoenix. Carolina’s was making giant flour tortillas decades before California decided it was cool, and they’re still some of the best — made to order and hot enough to burn your tongue. They make some fabulous, soupy burros, wrapped around stewed green or red chile, though the less iconic Oaxaca Special — with beans, cheese and chorizo — may be my favorite. Better yet, go ahead and get a machaca chimichanga. Here, it’s light and crisp, almost like pastry, and they might be the best argument for the form around.\n\nDetails: 1202 E. Mohave St., Phoenix.

Shouldn’t we have gotten over this by now? I say a lusty celebration of all things fragrant and funky is the cure, and Casa Filipina is where we’re going to throw the party. The poster child for laid-back international fare, Casa Filipina is a cozy mom-and-pop shop that joins a bakery and restaurant. The former fills multiple cases with wild and colorful sweets; the latter fills a menu with homestyle classics of Filipino cuisine. The uninitiated can ease into things with papery-crisp, cigar-shaped lumpia — Filipino spring rolls — or tortang talong, a gentle, comforting omelet stuffed with eggplant and pork. Speaking of pork, swineophiles will lose their minds over the crisp pata, a massive pork hock fried to a golden crisp; or the lechon kawali — chunks of crispy pork with a liver-enriched, sweet-and-sour sauce. When you’re ready, the funky, peanutty intensity of the kare kare or the dinuguan — a gorgeously thick, black vinegar and pork blood-enriched stew — will be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 3531 W.

Cantonese, Sichuan, Hunan, sure, but who had even heard of Dongbei, nestled up to Korea in the far northeast reaches of the country? For many, Sunny Zhao and Lulu Zhou’s dumpling-dispensing destination was the first glimpse into a world of Chinese cuisine that stretched far beyond Americanized versions of midcentury standbys. Out with the rice, in with the wheat, formed into nubby chilled noodles dressed with tingling oil, baked into bread stuffed with leeks and rolled into the wrappers for Chou’s signature beef pies. The size of a hamburger patty with the juice of a soup dumpling and a sizzling, crunchy crust, they’re not to be missed. The winter gets cold in northwestern China, and Chou’s packs the kind of hearty soups and stews meant to insulate you from the cold and generate some heat. Not that we need more heat in Phoenix, but it’s a fascinating subset of Chinese cuisine to explore.\n\nDetails: 910 N. Alma School Road, Chandler, 480-821-2888. MAP IT! Also, 1250 E.

Sure, this is casual fare served from behind a fish counter, but its diminutive footprint belies the oversize impact it’s having on the local scene. Jon Heflin and Hogan Jamison truck in stellar seafood from San Diego three times a week, and the few staples they can’t catch or trade themselves are flown in from excellent sources. What isn’t sold in the case or distributed to local restaurants goes to chef Juan Zamora, who has crafted a compact but robust list of bowls, salads and sandwiches with everyday character and a hint of refinement. Cool mounds of cubed fish are joined by shishito peppers, slivered watermelon radish or pickled beech mushrooms. A delicately composed tostada or bruschetta might light up the specials board. Wednesday’s green chile tuna melt with fresh confit tuna and kimchi chimichurri has developed a fan club. There’s a reason the line is out the door and you can’t swing a stick in the place without hitting at least three chefs who are grabbing lunch on the way to work.\n\nDetails: 8015 E.

Formerly the right-hand man of Binkley’s culinary operation, Gauthier recently took over Carefree’s Café Bink and converted it into Confluence, a new spot that has the Valley’s fine-dining geeks all atwitter. In appearance, this is still a casual restaurant, little changed from the Café Bink days. But while the plates show Binkley’s influence on Gauthier’s work, this wild, creative fare is worlds apart from the bistro classics that previously anchored the space. A roasted peach dusted with cocoa and drizzled with honey plays against a creamy, funky Epoisses cheese fondue. A gloriously salty pork broth with simmered cockscomb works its way into the fibers of a slab of smoked pork belly, lightened with shiso and edamame. Fish dishes are tight. Golden pan-seared red snapper contrasts earthy lentils with sweet grapes and a light broth set ablaze with Calabrian chile. Halibut sits in a lush corn crema with little nibbles of Spanish chorizo and crispy garlic chips. Just a few months old, Confluence is doing some seriously exciting things and may be the sleeper hit of 2018.\n\nDetails: 36889 N. Tom Darlington Drive, Carefree.

Having parted ways with Helio Basin Brewing Co., Stanger teamed up with Sean Traynor to open a neighborhood restaurant/watering hole in suddenly red-hot south Tempe. The joint is no-frills, casual and a little raucous with a young drinking crowd. Cocktails, appropriately light and summery in the early going, have made for a nifty collection of refreshing concoctions. Stanger’s food, meanwhile, already is equal parts sharp and fascinating. Corn dumplings that resemble hush puppies sit in a thin, onion-rich Parmesan cream that’s good enough to be served on its own as a chilled soup. Forget the veggie burgers — Stanger builds a “burger” from celeriac and roasted vegetables that’s more satisfying than most meat substitutes. Medallions of beef swim in a Cheddar-scented beef jus; and the Belgian hare, with root vegetable pipian and a bit of apricot, is dynamite. Whatever you do, don’t skip the pie.\n\nDetails: 1006 E.

It took a bit of a culinary kook to open a restaurant based around creative crepes in south Tempe long before south Tempe suddenly became cool. And thank heavens Kraus has no fear, because six years later, Crepe Bar still thrives, its namesake serving as a foundation to pitch a technicolor panoply of Kraus’ wild concoctions. His crepes might sport pork belly in a sweet espresso-maple glaze, drizzled with chile aioli under a soft, runny egg. They might be rolled and crisped like dosa, to be shattered and dipped in hummus with crispy chickpeas. They could be turned into chips to make crepe chilaquiles or smothered with jerk sausage and Fontina. They could be plied with lemon curd and hibiscus jelly, maple butter with bruleed bananas and pecans; or formed from buckwheat with Sonoran honey. Not to knock tradition, but creations like these are an expression of pure culinary joy — the intersection of a wild imagination and obsessive attention to detail with the humble crepe as the hook.\n\nDetails: 7520 S.

There is also the fact that Rich Hinojosa’s creations — whatever you wish to call them — are flat-out delicious. In Crujiente’s case, consider the taco a template, where tortillas serve as the flavorful foundation for meticulously crafted small plates that draw from Hinojosa’s heritage, his fine-dining pedigree and a wide palette of international flavors. A gorgeous slip of Texas wagyu is dressed with puckery pickled shimeji mushrooms, cilantro mojo and a dab of karashi mustard. A steaming wedge of crisp tempura-fried avocado pairs with black beans and pickled onions and chiles. Fish, tender and juicy or deftly fried, is perfectly seasoned and dressed. And the tacos Crujientes, piled into a craggy, crisp shell, exemplify the Mexican-American crossover dishes of Hinojosa’s San Antonio upbringing.\n\nDetails: 3961 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

What can I say? David Najor serves a flipping-good dog at the Tempe original (the downtown Phoenix location is independently owned). This is a decadent coney we’re talking about: A gently spiced, natural-casing dog with a killer snap — made for Najor by a Michigan sausage maker — drowning in meaty sauce, onions and a squirt of yellow mustard. Fries are spot-on, too, freshly cut and fried with a little crisp and a steaming, tender core. The burgers are just as good. Tiny golf-ball-size wads of meat are smashed on the griddle and cooked to a juicy, sizzling crisp, then layered with cheese and stacked tall. They’ll happily make them larger or smaller, but three to five of these skinny patties is the sweet spot, in my book. Grab a Faygo and a bag of chips and you’re good to go. Sure, it’s just burgers and dogs. But burgers and dogs are rarely so correct.\n\nDetails: 930 W. Broadway Road, Tempe.

A boutique hotel is in the works for the corner where Don & Charlie’s now stands, and pending city approval, Don Carson stands poised to enjoy a well-deserved retirement. But at the very least, this Chicago-style tavern with enough sports memorabilia to fill a museum will have one final sendoff during spring training. This is the kind of fare that appeals to the baseball crowd: chopped liver with crunchy bagel chips; scampi “Chicago style” (that’s shrimp DeJonghe for those in the know); baby back ribs sauced and charred to a smoky crisp; and a meat locker full of steaks, including a killer prime rib eye with a deep, blackened crust. This is well-prepared, easy-to-enjoy food served in a comfy old Barcalounger of a restaurant, and she’ll be dearly missed.\n\nDetails: 7501 E. Camelback Road, Scottsdale.

Justin Park’s food is meant to be consumed with alcohol, plain and simple, and it’s riotously fun. Tteok kochi — chewy little rice cake nubbins basted with gochujang, broiled to a sticky crisp and dusted with crushed peanuts — is the ultimate bar snack, as far as I’m concerned. The fire chicken is a rare spicy dish that lives up to its name, swimming in a screaming hot chile gravy beneath a blanket of melted mozzarella. Crispy chunks of fried chicken abound, whether doused in a sweet and spicy Korean red sauce, served with slivered onions and a creamy dressing or offered as padak — topped with a mountain of shredded scallions and a sweet soy-mustard dip. And the seafood pancake is an unusual take thereon, loose and eggy on the top with a delicately crisped bottom. Come for the food, stay for the booze and karaoke, then order a second round of snacks.\n\nDetails: 1954 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

On recent visits to the Phoenix icon’s namesake steakhouse, I’ve had immolated chops, sauteed spinach that’s mostly unseasoned cream and salads composed of limp, wilting spring mix. And yet I find myself unable to leave Durant’s off my list. Not because I’m afraid to slay a sacred cow — there are enough popular omissions here to jam my inbox with angry reader emails for months — but because goldarnit, I just can’t help but love the place. Durant’s is as much a museum as it is a restaurant, a rare relic of a bygone era filled with red leather banquettes, patterned velvet walls and worn wooden bars. Meanwhile, servers are there when you need them, gone when you don’t, and they hit that perfect note of graceful deference with just a faint, sardonic wink. Restaurants like Durant’s simply don’t exist anymore, except when they do, apparently. I can’t look past what a rare and special place it is, no matter how badly the kitchen overcooks my steak. No, the food isn’t especially good. But I’ll be there, if they’ll still have me, sitting at the bar with a shrimp cocktail and a very large martini.\n\nDetails: 2611 N. Central Ave., Phoenix.

Sonoran hot dogs abound, particularly late at night, when the air starts to cool and the temporary street stands set up shop. One crucial quality separates good from the great: toasting. The worst Sonoran dog with a freshly griddled bun will be better than most of those with a steamed bun, but El Caprichoso doesn’t force us to choose. This is the quintessential Arizona street dog — a cheap, low-quality sausage wrapped in crisp bacon with a grocery list of Mexican toppings and a sweet bun griddled to a deep, gorgeous gold. A folding table, a pop-up tent, some fluorescent light and 100-degree temps at 2 a.m. and you have an Arizona rite of passage.\n\nDetails: 2826 N. 35th Ave., Phoenix.

Serving breakfast and lunch to a pickup-truck crowd, Rosa Avitia’s Mexican diner is a casual charmer. There’s something unassuming and honest in her minimal chilaquiles, stale tortillas toasted in oil, doused with fresh salsa and topped with melted mozzarella cheese and a dusting of cotija. A dead-simple birria pairs tender goat with thick corn tortillas, a basic broth that only comes alive when doctored to your taste. But the killer app, so to speak, is the machaca. At so many restaurants, it’s rehydrated sludge with the flavor of acrid pot roast. Here, it’s simple dried beef, pounded and cooked with just a splash of liquid, still dense and chewy — almost jerky-like — and perfect with eggs. The cebada, an horchata-like drink made with barley, is still too sweet, but it’s more flavorful and less overly sweet than most. Served in a giant red plastic cup, it somehow makes the whole meal feel correct.\n\nDetails: 2140 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix.

It’s been more than a year since Eugenia Theodosopoulos closed the Tempe location of Essence Bakery Café, and if fans of the original are still a little raw, it isn’t hard to see why. She is an enormously skilled baker who brought her French training to the desert and — this is no easy task — learned to adapt her techniques to our environment. Her delicate macarons are what set the Pinterest crowd on fire. But there are stellar baked goods aplenty, like perfect croissants, crisp baguettes, fruit Danish and seasonal specials like buche de noel. More substantial fare is also a delight. Theodosopoulos makes an excellent turnover studded with crumbled sausage and Gruyere and — to nobody’s surprise — a killer quiche. Come lunchtime, a béchamel-drenched croque monsieur with a bit of jalapeño buzz or a silky chicken pot pie are both winners. And she sneaks in a little bit of her heritage in the form of a gloriously light spanakopita.\n\nDetails: 3830 W. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

This is the kind of place that restaurateurs will tell you isn’t supposed to succeed on the left half of the map. And yet there it is: A tiny independent serving straight-up traditional Italian classics, made with exceptional care and steadfastly refusing to drift into red sauce territory to please the masses. Fabio Ceschetti’s decision to abandon Scottsdale in favor of Peoria has paid him in spades, and it wasn’t a complex equation. This is the soul of casual Italian dining, serving wood-fired pizza and paste fatte in casa, such as lasagna plied with meaty ragu and smooth besciamella or airy gnocchi simply dressed in a silky, Gorgonzola-laced cream. Pizzas are spot-on, a gentle balance of chew and crisp and deeply developed flavor, topped with just a few perfect ingredients. Small, family-run spots that do so little but do it so well are the backbone of Italy’s restaurant culture, and the perfect antidote to a barrage of chains that overpromise and underdeliver.\n\nDetails: 8275 W.

There are endless reasons to love FnB, a quirky, cozy space that embodies its proprietors’ penchant for marching to their own beat. There’s Charleen Badman’s preternatural ability to coax vegetables into revealing their truest nature; her talent for sizzling premium proteins on the grill; and Pavle Milic’s zeal for Arizona wines and spirits. But perhaps more than all of that, their work has put a bold stamp on the Valley’s emergence as a maturing, sophisticated culinary scene that can run with the big boys without feeling the need to mimic them. Potted smoked trout rillettes join rustic bread and a rainbow of pickled vegetables. Creamy Peruvian aji amarilllo is wrapped in a crisp spring roll shell. And the Gilfeather rutabaga is a witty play on a classic baked potato, plied with ginger creme fraiche and chives. The way Badman ropes in diverse international influences while expressing Arizona’s underappreciated agricultural bounty is unparalleled. If one restaurant best exemplifies the blossoming of our cuisine over the past decade, it’s FnB.\n\nDetails: 7125 E. Fifth Ave., Scottsdale.

He followed his daughter to New York, and it seemed that his charming destination for classic Italian fare might be lost forever. But in 2012, he returned to Old Town and opened up a time portal on Scottsdale Road, leading straight into a bygone era of white tablecloths, soft music, servers who know when not to talk and Italian fare that sports a little class while satisfying on a deep, visceral level. Photos of Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren line the walls; a pungent swipe of fresh garlic lines the bruschetta; and a crisp, perfectly seasoned crust lines the exterior of the orecchie elefante, Fazzuoli’s take on a juicy, thick-cut veal chop Milanese. Franco’s gently tiptoes the line between Italian and American, embracing some of the New World’s meatier, saucier habits without drifting into full-blown red sauce territory. This is classic cuisine done right, a bit of old-school elegance and a nod to the days when we used the word “continental” without some of the era’s clunky heft. And if anything starts to feel a touch too rich, a taste of Fazzuoli’s sweet, airy merenghata will take care of that... subito.\n\nDetails: 4327 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

It’s even more unfortunate the one dish that has achieved widespread attention — fry bread— isn’t rooted in indigenous people’s centuries of history and culture. Rather, fry bread was a food of necessity prepared with government rations during a time when that same government was evicting them from the land that had sustained their culture. Still, here’s a dish that has become an emblem — both good and bad. The Fry Bread House, recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of America’s Classics, makes by far the most delicious version I’ve tried in Phoenix. The first taste of Fry Bread House’s steaming, resilient bread with a gorgeous golden crisp is an “Aha!” moment, whether it’s piled with beans and meaty chile or dusted with cinnamon or powdered sugar and drizzled with honey.\n\nDetails: 4545 N.

When Gallo Blanco left the Clarendon Hotel, chef Doug Robson promised the white rooster would rise again. It took a few years, but the new Gallo Blanco is worth the wait. Robson’s casual, stylish spot in the Garfield district is leading a new wave of contemporary Arizona Mexican fare that’s smartly conceived, crisply executed, made with top-notch ingredients and a bargain for the price. Thick tortillas cradle taco fillings that get a quick sizzle in a wok. Salads composed with pristine produce boast a textural pop that gives them uncommon appeal. Quick-cured fish dishes like coctel de mariscos and ceviche de pescado are light and vibrant. And drippy, hedonistic affairs like the egg-soaked naco torta or the envuelto — pork al pastor suspended in gooey, griddled cheese — are completely irresistible. Toss in JT Taber’s breezy cocktails and it’s hard to want for more in a casual Mexican restaurant. If this is the wave of the future, we’re in for a good ride.\n\nDetails: 928 E. Pierce St., Phoenix.

Just as Asian fusion was newly reborn as a subtler, more sophisticated version of its schlocky ‘90s self, Chamberlin and his chefs, Rene Andrade and Roberto Centeno, are doing the same with the Southwest fare of yore, making it lighter, fresher and more thoughtful. A couple of months into its run, Ghost Ranch is making a mark. A stylish New Mexico-inspired room designed by Gennaro Garcia proves an airy and colorful home to dishes that reference the history of Southwest cuisine while bucking its more dated conventions. Pumpkin soup is smooth and lush, its richness derived from caramelization rather than abundance of cream. Enchiladas are fried to a crisp and lightly dressed rather than smothered in an earthy, smoky sauce made with Chimayo chiles. The chile relleno is roasted rather than fried, stuffed with intense mushroom duxelles and topped with a nest of crispy leeks. And in a true nod to the times, one of the strongest dishes on the menu is the plato vegano, a gorgeous and hearty collection of roasted vegetables with a splash of coconut milk and a chipotle cashew cream.\n\nDetails: 1006 E.

But the soft-spoken Kantak is so much more than a salad slinger. The Gladly, his sophomore effort, is on point, a casual and stylish American restaurant that isn’t afraid to have fun. Sassy, hearty and just a little wonky enough with the fundamentals to satisfy, The Gladly slings a mean chicken liver pate with pistachio and sage mustard. Plus, a gorgeous duck meatloaf enriched with foie gets a smoked cherry demi-glace. Larded scallops are plied with a cola gastrique; and coffee-rubbed short ribs are eye-opening in more than one sense of the term. What’s more, Donald Hawk’s raw bar — offering straight-up chilled seafood alongside creations like his signature ahi crudo with brown-butter vinaigrette and raising relish — is the icing on an already formidable cake.\n\nDetails: 2201 E.

Glai Baan is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Cat Bunnag’s achingly charming little bungalow took a while to find its footing (though accurate at the time, I wish I could have that review back). But in 2018, it’s consistently spitting fire. With the ease of a seaside beach house and the warmth of a neighborhood bar, Glai Baan is a time-slowing destination that combines a mellow room with explosive dishes. That doesn’t always mean chile heat (nor should it). Coconut-marinated pork skewers are tender and sweet; deep-fried son-in-law eggs are dressed with a tart, punchy sauce; and mackerel fried rice is a steamy, comforting affair with a distinctive fermented richness. But when the fire arrives, it’s on. Funky salted crab papaya salad is dense with bird chiles. Kapro gai kai dao perks up minced chicken and a lacy egg with basil and no shortage of chiles. And a complex panang curry has some heat, but not at the expense of layer after fragrant layer of fresh, intense flavor. We were long overdue for a place like this.\n\nDetails: 2333 E.

Right up until that part of me was stuffed in a sack and tossed in a river by the part of me that can’t recall having more juicy, succulent, perfectly grilled meats anywhere else in town. I surrender. Yes, Green Corner looks like an antiseptic neighborhood counter-service joint, but just try to keep me away from the kifta kabob, scented with sumac and cinnamon, tender and meaty and dripping with sizzling lamb fat. You’ve seen this menu a hundred times before, and standards like baba ghannoug, hummus and kibbeh are all solid, if less than stellar. But anything off the phalanx of rotisseries or the kitchen’s grill is something to target, whether it be charred shawarma, plump chicken thighs or lamb chops seared on the grill. The truth is, most of the Valley’s widely revered Middle Eastern restaurants don’t season and cook their meats nearly as well as Green Corner.\n\nDetails: 1038 W. Southern Ave., Mesa, 480-835-2313.

Here, you’ll find a mix of classic maki and nigiri built on a solid foundation of excellent seafood and rice alongside Hashimoto’s more brash, contemporary creations. Among them: the Hana Egg, a soft-boiled, tempura-fried egg paired with a zippy mentaiko sauce; and grilled lamb marinated with miso and pomegranate juice. This is a family that can bring the wow factor if you want it. But the unsung heroes of the menu are Hana’s classic Japanese comfort dishes, whose charms are rooted in culinary tradition. Chicken karaage is perfectly seasoned, crisp and juicy. Bento boxes feature popular items like teriyaki and tonkatsu, but they’re anchored with simple simmered vegetables. Chilled soba noodles come with ethereal tempura and an icy, crystal-clear tsuyu dip; and ramen is firm to the tooth and bathed in lush, flavorful broths. The gleaming raw fish and colorful oyster shooters may win Instagram, but while plenty of neighborhood sushi joints can feed your eyes, few can feed your soul like Hana.\n\nDetails: 5524 N.

The new, contemporary resort is less the swingin’ hot spot of its ‘60s heyday and more a luxe oasis that’s built as a picture frame for nearby Camelback Mountain. At Hearth ’61, chefs Charles Wylie, Richard Garcia and Alfred Muro walk the tightrope of producing inventive cuisine while adhering to the constraints of being the resort’s primary restaurant, and the restaurant is finding its stride. A swanky and lively room complete with a water feature is the proper home for a spicy, rough-hewn ahi tartare dressed with crisp, fresh vegetables or roasted prawns with andouille-flecked polenta. Soups like a squash puree or a lobster bisque have a silky feel and bold intensity; and a side of ancient grain risotto is a nutty delight. Hefty short rib agnolotti splashed with horseradish cream are like an Italian-Polish crossover dish; and simple roasted meats are beautifully prepared. But I’m still stuck on the swordfish steak, a juicy specimen set ablaze by an herbal, green harissa.\n\nDetails: Mountain Shadows Resort, 5445 E. Lincoln Drive, Paradise Valley.

The cure for this epidemic of meaty myopia rests in places like Hodori. An ancient stalwart of the Valley’s Korean restaurant scene, Hodori continues to stand tall as one of its best and most welcoming. Kimchi jun with a gentle sourness and prominent burn sizzles; and bosam — steamed pork with spicy fermented accompaniments and cabbage to wrap — is a decadent platter that could feed a few dozen. Soups and stews are the thing, whether they include delicate tofu swimming in a sea of soondubu fire or milky dogani tang, an ox knee and brisket elixir with a gentle, restorative countenance. And don’t worry. If you insist on meatifying, the kitchen does a very respectable job with standards like juicy chok kalbi and daeji bulgogi in a fire-laced marinade.\n\nDetails: 1116 S.

A Western-trained chef who spent a year working in Japan, Hebert has developed a very personal style of ramen that might get under the skin of the tonkotsu fanboys, but it’s hard to see that as a bad thing. It isn’t that he hasn’t done his homework. He’s a student of the cuisine who made his name blending French and Japanese flavors and techniques in upscale environs. But like so many shops in Japan that are playing with convention, Hebert’s humble ramen bar uses the framework as a means of self-expression. What he’s expressing is one of the best bowls of noodles in town. The goma is the signature item, a sesame-spiked pork broth with a nutty countenance. But the gently smoky shoyu and the chile-spiked seafood ramen are also personal favorites. Spiked with some unconventional ingredients and possessed of non-traditional tweaks, they’re solidly grounded in careful technique.\n\nDetails: 15689 N. Hayden Road, Scottsdale.

Some do it better than others and a few are quite good, but the rote collection of pho, bun and broken rice dishes has achieved the formulaic predictability of a fast-food chain. At Mekong Plaza, the sit-down restaurants in the front may be more popular, but the food court in the back is where you’ll find the action. Hue Gourmet features the flavors of central Vietnam, and if your experience with Vietnamese food is limited to your neighborhood pho joint, this will be a game-changer. Chewy, thick tapioca noodles and chunks of crab comprise the viscous, briny banh canh cua. Mi quang marries turmeric-spiced noodles with shrimp, pork, vegetables and crisp sesame crackers. Banh beo, glutinous rice coins, are dotted with dried shrimp and served with a lip-puckering sauce. The bun bo hue is the genuine article — a fiery, funky lemongrass soup thick with beef and pork, rather than the doctored pho you’ll find elsewhere in town. And speaking of pho, don’t bother: They don’t make it, and you won’t miss it.\n\nDetails: Mekong Plaza, 66 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

Yeah, Chelsea’s Kitchen makes the Arcadia moms swoon; Buck & Rider’s parking lot is jam-packed at all hours with silver and black SUVs; and La Grande Orange has practically achieved historical landmark status at this point. But I love Ingo’s sun-dappled patio and circular dining bar. I love those tart, mustardy deviled eggs and shattered potato chips with yogurt and searing hot sauce. I love the crispy fried sandwiches, both chicken and fish. I love the barbecue and bacon-laden Paris Texas burger. I love the Farmer’s Daughter burger, with tart sauerkraut and funky fol epi. And I love that I can eat one of those burgers and not feel like I just consumed half a cow. The thing is, Lynn is a student of careful design and he runs a tight ship. When you’re talking about a neighborhood burger stand, that makes it just a little special.\n\nDetails: 4502 N. 40th St., Phoenix.

Though I’m a hopeless fanboy, by all public accounts, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has barely set foot in Arizona since J&G opened. But to overlook it on that basis would be a grand disservice to Jacques Qualin, who has taken the international super chef’s vision and made J&G Steakhouse his own. Yes, the steaks are excellent, and if you’re the saucy type, they’re accompanied by the best in town. But to my mind, that’s the least interesting part of the menu. I geek out on piping-hot Dungeness crab fritters with cool Asian pear and a sweet sauce laden with black pepper. I swoon over chilled crab and avocado with a smooth and creamy cocktail sauce tarted up with brandy. I marvel at ruby-red, sweet-and-sour beet risotto with a puckery lemon foam. I salivate over seared beef cheeks with a buttery habanero hot sauce. And I chill with baked Alaska, like a creamy bruleed hedgehog, cool pineapple sorbet waiting within. I have a Vongerichten trading card pinned up in my cubicle. But to me, this is Qualin’s restaurant.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

That’s the kind of stridently unpretentious hole-in-the-wall barbecue dive that fulfills all our romantic storybook notions of what American smoked meat should be. James Lewis didn’t even have a restaurant to call home until 2017, before which he sold barbecue from a guerilla street operation parked under a bridge. But now with a south Phoenix storefront of his own, it’s far easier to sample his ruby ribs with tender chew, juicy and succulent smoked chicken and a barky, chaotic tangle of pulled pork that’s the best I’ve tried in the Valley. His understated, Zen-like sauce is a supplement, not a distraction, and a killer cup of peppery stewed greens headlines unusually good sides. The secret? The ebullient Lewis will insist it’s what the “JL” in JL Smokehouse stands for: “Just Love.”\n\nDetails: 1712 E. Broadway Road, Phoenix.

The atmosphere is essentially nonexistent and the line can be long and slow. But none of that matters when you’re presented with a smooth, elastic round of yam fufu, bathed in a spiced tomato soup brimming with goat meat. This is west African cuisine — hewing closest to Ghanaian — built on seasoned starches, meats and thick, sultry stews. The chicken stew is deep and ruddy with the rich sweetness of reduced tomatoes, while the bean stew is round and robust with beans that have perfect bite. Jollof rice arrives with tender chicken and slippery sweet plantains. Waakye — Ghana’s take on rice and beans — goes equally well with stewed goat or a mound of seasoned spinach. And the peanut soup defies the sweet conventions to which Americans are accustomed, striking a deliciously deep, earthy note.\n\nDetails: 325 W. Elliot Road, Tempe.

Under the direction of chef Ryan Swanson, Kai is as good as ever, and maybe better. From the room to the service to the plates, here’s a rare restaurant that exudes refinement at every turn, weaving a palette of indigenous ingredients into a striking collection of dishes. A soup of pureed squash takes on the sultry scent of mesquite-charred hahl with hits of sweet i’itoi onion and tart red berry dust. A mélange of pickled veggies join cactus shoots, planted in rye soil and bathed in saguaro mist, creating a wild to behold and wilder to eat vegetable forest. And meaty buffalo tenderloin joins asparagus-scented cholla buds and tepary beans, sweetened by saguaro syrup. Kai has one foot in the past, but it’s looking to the future. Here’s hoping fine dining of this caliber continues to have one.\n\nDetails: Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, 5594 W. Wild Horse Pass Blvd., Gila River Reservation.

Iridescent exterior paint job aside, Las 15 Salsas looks like any old neighborhood taco joint, conjuring visions of greasy gorditas and immolated carne asada. What it contains, however, is an explosive menu of regional Mexican specialties, from crisp, bean-smeared tlayudas to thick, steaming molotes. The heart and soul of the menu is an assortment of moles — all five of them. Hernandez serves the familiar rich and ruddy mole coloradito and the popular chocolate-spiked mole negro, bursting with the complexity of burned chiles. But she also slings a vibrant, herb-dense mole verde; a smooth and lightly sweet mole Amarillo; and the even harder to find mole estofado, which plays like a Mexican-Mediterranean mashup. Bring some friends and try them all. Object lessons don’t get much more delicious than this.\n\nDetails: 722 W. Hatcher Road, Phoenix.

Maybe we got a little carried away with the notion that our pizza needed a seal of approval from overseas. But it speaks to Justin Piazza’s care and attention to detail that his pizzerias are one of only two restaurant groups in the Valley to get the official benediction from Napoli. What Piazza prepares, both in his Glendale and downtown Phoenix locations, is a faithful rendition of the classic — flour, water, olive oil and salt crafted into a chewy, flavorful dough with a blistered cornicone and a paucity of quality toppings. None of which is to downplay the antipasti, paste and more heavily laden pizzas, but the menu’s raison d’être is anything with the initials “D.O.C.” at the end.\n\nDetails: 5803 W.

Our local fare is represented by a range of Mexican restaurants, some more closely resembling the traditional fare of northern Mexico and some — like La Piñata — more heavily influenced by American conventions. This joyously colorful retro AZ-Mex stalwart is where you go for ladlefuls of tingling chile sauce, gobs of sour cream and oodles of melty yellow cheese, a breed of naturally occurring fusion fare all its own. Cheese crisps are a model for the genre, but even more decadent is the Mary Lou — a stoner mashup of a dish that folds an entire cheese crisp around a core of molten red or green chile. Enchiladas are soft and tender, filled with flavorful meats and completely smothered in a ruddy, spicy bog of chile sauce. Crunchy tacos and flautas are piled with chopped tomato and icy crisp shredded lettuce. Even though I’m an unadorned chimichanga evangelist, here’s the place where letting them smother that crisp shell in a bucket of sauce feels like the only way to go.\n\nDetails: 5521 N. Seventh Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-279-1763, lapinatarestaurantaz.com.\n\nLamp Wood Oven Pizzeria\n\nChris Bianco inspired a generation of Arizona pizza makers and, simply put, Matt Pilato is one of the best. In a town bursting at the seams with wood-fired pizza, Pilato has focused an obsessive attention to detail on local conventions to create a signature style that’s descended from Bianco, but entirely his own. Oft overlooked due to its distance from the city’s core, Lamp serves a pizza that’s modestly topped, roundly flavored and crisper than most. Pizza menus that stretch into double-digit offerings tend to get diluted, but every one of Pilato’s 28 creations is well-balanced and carefully thought-out. The Scientist offsets a plethora of salumi with dense, meaty Castelvetrano olives. The Gepetto takes a sweet and pungent route, pairing Pilato’s boozy house sausage with caramelized onions and blue cheese. And though it’s one of Phoenix’s prime specimens, the pizza isn’t even the best thing on the menu. That title belongs to the mignulata, a type of Sicilian bread that sports a tender, layered core stuffed with pungent onions, sausage and pecorino enveloped in a crackling crisp crust.\n\nDetails: 8900 E.

Jones had been around the block, cheffing his way through a series of Valley gigs before hitting his stride with a lunch-counter version of The Larder + The Delta. Now, finally with his own space and kitchen, he’s turning up the heat. His modern Southern fare with a little local flair and a dash of Chicago soul is electric, and now it’s unchained. The Low Country perlou has gotten a king-size upgrade, its Carolina Gold rice now piled with clams, mussels and colossal prawns. A Two Wash Ranch chicken strikes a pose, one talon in the air, resting on a panzanella built on cucumber, Arizona melon, cornbread and plenty of sweetened vinegar. But perhaps nothing exemplifies Jones’ work more than his hoppin’ John. Some call it sacrilege, but pulling out the pork to put the focus on the sizzling rice, red peas and herbs is like seeing the flavors through a microscope for the first time. The Larder + The Delta was already one of the Valley’s most exciting spots. Now we get to see what Jones can really do.\n\nDetails: Portland on The Park, 200 W. Portland St., Phoenix.

This is as informal as it gets. Grab a ticket, mark off a few selections, poke your head into the kitchen and try to flag down somebody to take your order. Wedge yourself into a tiny table, and in a matter of moments you’ll be feasting on pani puri, diminutive spheroid crisps ready to be stuffed with potato and chickpeas and a splash of tamarind chutney. Papri — small, thin wafers — are smothered with yogurt, a mix of fragrant chutneys and sev, a flurry of tiny, crisp noodles. The bada paav — a fried potato burger, for lack of a more elegant description — is hearty, playfully spiced and served up on a no-frills sesame burger bun. And a panoply of sultry curries and stewed vegetables stand at the ready for sipping and dipping. Plates are small and the prices are smaller, making it easy for those unfamiliar with chaat to dive in and explore.\n\nDetails: 1813 E. Baseline Road, Tempe.

Though the Valley was awash in barbecue joints before Scott Holmes hit the scene, a couple of exceptions aside, they ranged from serviceable to shameful. But even the standouts couldn’t touch the product Little Miss BBQ put out from day one: A trayful of succulent smoked meat that turns dedicated carnivores into blubbering fools willing to stand in line for hours in 115-degree heat. Holmes has achieved a quantum leap in Valley barbecue, and now, everybody else — some respectably so — is playing catch-up. It has become an arms race, folks, but Holmes still holds the ultimate doomsday device: A peppery smoked brisket that oozes fat with a gentle nudge, flakes into silky bliss on the roof of your mouth and packs a smoky wallop. Taking nothing away from Holmes’ ribs, house-made sausage and killer grits and beans, the fatty brisket is the dish that pushed Phoenix barbeque to the next level.\n\nDetails: 4301 E.

It’s easy to quip that Phoenix is still green, an immature city without a strong sense of history and time. Then you descend the narrow staircase for a special dinner in the timber-supported basement at The Hermosa Inn where Megargee (reputedly) sold bootleg hooch and hosted illicit gambling, and it’s a stark reminder that the history is here if you’re willing to look. Lon’s at The Hermosa is bursting with rustic charm, not to mention the beauty of one of the best dining terraces in town, and Jeremy Pacheco is so perfect for the place he came to work here twice — returning after a stint in Las Vegas because he couldn’t stay away. This is contemporary dining, but there’s a lingering hint of cowboy cuisine in Pacheco’s menu, from a smoky tortilla soup with pulled chicken to a confit duck crepe with spiced mole to gorgeous pecan-roasted lamb. If Mangalitsa is on the menu, don’t miss it. Pacheco knows his swine.\n\nDetails: Hermosa Inn, 5532 N. Palo Cristi Road, Paradise Valley.

Peruvian is such a fascinating cuisine, blending Spanish, Japanese, African, Italian, Chinese and indigenous influences into a complex jigsaw puzzle where you can still see the seams but the pieces fit perfectly. The Valley’s Peruvian restaurants all have their specialties, but I find myself returning to Los Andes for dishes like fiery ceviche plied with sweet potato and onions and spiked with pisco. Causa — cool mashed potatoes tarted up with lime and yellow chiles and layered with shrimp or chicken salad — has a light, fresh pop. And skewers of grilled beef heart bring the smoky, meaty spice. Lomo saltado, always a crowd-pleaser, is a hearty stir-fry of beef and potatoes. Graham makes my favorite aji de gallina in town — a bizarre and utterly comforting dish of chile-spiked stewed chicken in a creamy morass of potatoes, Parmesan and ground walnuts.\n\nDetails: 6025 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

Really, this is all I want in a Puerto Rican restaurant. Now with a little room to maneuver (their previous space could seat eight if everybody held their breath), it’s a little easier to bring a crowd and work your way through a list of Puerto Rican classics, still charmingly unpretentious, served in baskets and Styrofoam trays. Pasteles — pork-laced tamales steamed in banana leaves — have a smooth texture and herbal fragrance. For mains, starch lays down the baseline in the form of rice and pigeon peas or beans with squash; and they pair with luscious meats like roasted pork with a citrus marinade or gloriously tender baked chicken. Plantains are abundant: As crisp tostones, sweetly caramelized amarillos or substituting as bread for the jibarito, which is a steak sandwich laden with cheese, vegetables and garlicky mayo. And the Mofongo is outstanding, a mash of plantains, pork and enough garlic to make you think they buy it by the truckload.\n\nDetails: 1916 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-223-8217, facebook.com/milliescafeaz.\n\nMora Italian\n\nMaybe the most wildly anticipated opening in recent memory, Mora Italian — predictably — has come to rest somewhere between the life-changing culinary experience Scott Conant’s fans were expecting and the overrated faceplant the celebrity schadenfreude crowd was hoping for. Which is to say, this is an exciting place that’s sometimes more solid than sensational, but it can hit some screaming highs when it’s firing on all cylinders. Mora is busy and loud and where you want to be when you want to be seen, managing to stand out even on a strip as brash and brazen as Seventh Street’s new restaurant row. Antipasti like a crisp fritto misto or creamy carbonara suppli hit the mark. But the polenta bosciaola — pairing rich polenta with an intense brew of seasonal mushrooms — is a flat-out stunner. Pastas like the black campanelle — a smart and spicy spin on clam pasta — and meltaway lobster gnudi are strong, and grilled meats and fish can hit similar highs. But the best dish on the menu may still be Conant’s signature pasta al pomodoro, as simple and perfect as they come.\n\nDetails: 5651 N. Seventh St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-795-9943, moraitalian.com.\n\nMowry & Cotton\n\nIt’s tough to stifle a chuckle when the “casual” restaurant at one of the swankiest resorts in town cites Arizona’s dusty, Wild West history as the inspiration for a spare-no-expense space that’s gorgeously appointed in crisp leather and smooth sanded wood. But while Tandy Peterson’s menu displays a sneaky level of refinement commensurate with The Phoenician’s usual luxury, it’s applied to dishes that evoke a kind of rustic sass. Mowry & Cotton’s stunning oven is a far cry from a campfire, but char and smoke permeate her creations. Robust, earthy flatbreads take atypical toppings like mushrooms with apricots and horseradish. Smoked yogurt and mustard greens dress barbecued beets; and crisp roasted potatoes are plied with fiery chorizo and hot sauce. A whole bass turned inside out and roasted to a juicy crisp makes for delectable do-it-yourself tacos. And grilled pheasant — deeply lacquered with an anchovy wash and buried beneath broccolini, almonds, citrus and cherries — is a remarkable dish.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E.

Hartman slings what might be the best brisket in town not made by a guy named Holmes. He does it with a Southern Pride smoker, which usually raises the floor and lowers the ceiling. I say “usually” because Hartman plays an instrument designed for volume like a virtuoso, coaxing a surprising level of subtlety out of meat that’s more gently seasoned than some of the widely popular styles — everyday rather than occasion barbecue, if you will. Of course, brisket isn’t the be-all and end-all. His ribs, pulled pork and hot links join some solid sides to make for one of the most consistently excellent barbecue options in town. Sauces are numerous and thoughtfully concocted, but they’re best used sparingly. The place is called “Naked” for a reason.\n\nDetails: 2340 W. Bell Road, Phoenix, 602-439-4227. MAP IT!

Among the best of the newcomers is Nishikawa Ramen, which recently opened a second Valley location. Nishikawa serves solid gyoza and surprisingly excellent takoyaki, crisp and creamy with a nice nugget of octopus in the center. But the ramen is the thing here, and pork broth is Nishikawa’s medium. It’s a creamy and rich tonkotsu with a luscious, clean scent, and it serves as the base for six bowls, all of which are quite good. The straight tonkotsu with skinny Hakata-style noodles is lush, with tender pork chashu and a bump of pungent fish powder. Nishikawa’s miso ramen substitutes a more substantial kinky noodle along with the requisite corn, while the curry ramen is a nice change of pace. The signature bowl, however, is Nishikawa’s best. Laced with black garlic oil and fried onion, the Nishikawa Black lends a nice allium pungency and sweetness to an already exquisite broth.\n\nDetails: 1901 E. Ray Road, Chandler.

In a rare victory for quality and care, Raducha is now rightly recognized as one of the Valley’s most important bread makers, and his “modern wood-fired deli,” Noble Eatery, carries that ethos through to the lunch counter. Tender ciabatta is stuffed with fresh mozzarella and slivered finocchiona. Robust toast is smeared with creamy ricotta and topped with roasted mushrooms. The wheaty crust of a diminutive pizza is topped with potatoes and a whiff of rosemary. The tuna salad, gently dressed with olive oil and premium vinegar, is still a showstopper. At a time when most “feel-good” eating is factory-farmed bird food, we need more of this breed of rugged culinary honesty.\n\nDetails: 4525 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Nobuo Fukuda serves dazzling food that’s smart and precise. But the way he has so naturally married the techniques and ethos of his native Japan to the soul and flavors of Arizona is what makes his work unique. In a historic building subtly adorned with Japanese accents, his contemporary izakaya gracefully marries East and West, pairing tako with tomato and mozzarella, hamachi with grapefruit and avocado, tuna with roasted beets, and saikyo miso with foie gras. Moreover, Fukuda goes as humble as crisp tonkatsu sandwiched between slices of shokupan at lunch, and as refined as a delicate chawanmushi duo — cold and hot — served by appointment at the four-seat counter as part of his omakase. If you glimpse beneath the surface, Nobuo at Teeter House is as much about Arizona as it is about Japan. Seeing desert flavors and products focused through a Japanese lens is nothing short of revelatory.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 622 E. Adams St., Phoenix.

Noca was defined by Wexler’s obsessive food-geek palate. Nocawich is no different, slinging a short list of sandwiches and salads composed from stellar ingredients like Biellese salumi, Snake River Farms beef, Russ & Daughters lox and H&H bagels. The Italian Stallion layers killer giardiniera with slivers of fine salumi; and the Clubber Lang, with house roast beef and spicy provolone, conveys all the punch of its namesake. Wexler’s patty melt is a refined take on the genre made with Gruyere and a slick bordelaise; and his “What the cluck?” is probably the best fried chicken sandwich in town, with seasoned fries carefully engineered to a precise crunch. A breakfast burrito spiked with chimichurri crema and crispy potatoes is a game changer. Deep in Arizona State University territory with a menu almost entirely priced in the $8 to $12 range, it’s priced for a student’s budget. Let’s hope they appreciate what a gem they have there.\n\nDetails: 777 S. College Ave., Tempe. MAP IT! 480-758-5322, nocawich.com.\n\nOcotillo\n\nThis place fascinates on a number of levels. Approaching Ocotillo is like entering the quad of a culinary campus — a smartly designed compound that combines restaurant, event space, coffee shop, public park and biergarten all into one. It’s a study in urban oasis, connecting space, food and community. But from a culinary standpoint, Ocotillo is remarkable in the way it takes the spirit of the tiny restaurants that have shaped contemporary Arizona cuisine and finds a way to deliver that upstart ethos on a large scale. Snappy vegetable dishes like smoked beets with ricotta and pistachios or a whole head of cauliflower roasted to a deep, nutty brown with an aleppo vinaigrette and fresh herbs showcase fine produce. Robust pasta dishes like pappardelle in a rich ragu join meaty mains like mesquite grilled chicken, loaded with local honey, dates, citrus and chiles. This is the desert expressed on a plate in a restaurant that isn’t a sneaky, in-the-know hot spot. Put another way, Ocotillo is proof of concept that this new wave of Arizona cuisine needn’t be reserved for the fooderati.\n\nDetails: 3243 N. Third St., Phoenix.

Of course, communities need community gathering spots, and Old Town Sarajevo is one of Phoenix’s most prominent, serving Bosnian cuisine since 2001. A casual café gives way to a country village-themed dining room with a short list of hearty fare. Meaty cabbage rolls are splashed with a tomato-laced broth; bean soup is thick and earthy; and pastries stuffed with meat, spinach or cheese are tender and comforting. The pljeskavica, a monstrous spiced meat patty, is mighty fine. But the stars are the cevapi, juicy little veal sausages stuffed into a steaming bread called lepinja with a cloudlike crumb and a crisp, oily crust. The cevapi are as comforting as they are succulent — served with chopped raw onion, kajmak (a close cousin of sour cream called) and ajvar, a sweet and slightly pungent spread made with roasted eggplant and red peppers. The best way to end the meal? Turkish coffee and good conversation.\n\nDetails: 3411 W. Northern Ave., Phoenix.

Ho hum, another little hipster coffee shop with nice-looking pastries and a smattering of breakfast and lunch dishes. But a few bites deep, Ollie Vaughn’s starts to separate itself from the pack. Flaky, buttery almond croissants, lemon poppy-seed cake with a sharply sour glaze and a light, creamy tomato quiche emerge from the pastry case. Ricotta pancakes are gorgeous, light and tender, with fresh fruit compote and real maple syrup. Stellar biscuits can be smothered with sausage gravy or stuffed with eggs, meat and cheese for a build-your-own breakfast sandwich. Green chile pork, in stripped-down fashion, eschews the soupy standard and shoots instead for an understated burn. Hash browns that have a smooth, creamy core with a shattering, golden crisp — above and beneath — are the Olympian ideal of the form. Lunch excels as well, with a “Cuban” sandwich that features the green chile pork and an almost pungent tuna salad with the sweet-spicy punch of jalapeño marmalade. And to nobody’s surprise, Ollie’s coffee game is strong.\n\nDetails: 1526 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix.

But the true depth and breadth of this pillar of the Chinese culinary pantheon is poorly understood in the West, and better revealed at Original Cuisine than anywhere else in the Valley. A new wave of contemporary Sichuan cuisine — rooted in tradition but pushing creative boundaries — has washed over California and finally reached Arizona, where it rests in a well-tended whitewashed box of a restaurant in Mesa’s Asian market district. You can get the saline sting of fuqi feipian; the chile-laced tingle of Chongqing chicken; and a ginger- and garlic-packed mapo dofu, to be sure. But you can also get tender meatballs and slivers of winter melon in a simple, silky broth; moan-inducing slices of slippery pork belly dipped in a pungent sauce; and pickled Sichuan “kimchi” that’s gently tart and almost effervescent. The menu isn’t quite the murderer’s row that it was when the restaurant first launched, but this is still next-level Sichuan fare in a town that desperately needed it.\n\nDetails: 1853 W. Broadway Road, Mesa.

Now, with the new Gallo Blanco’s simplified menu, Otro stands in starker contrast. They’re both rooted in the same earth, but like the difference between Gallo’s corn tortillas and Otro’s flour tortillas, they explore some of the same themes in different ways. Both have killer breakfasts and sharp salads in common, but Otro maintains the more contemporary taco style, plying succulent pork belly with a sweet glaze and tomatillo relish; or chicken with mushrooms, poblanos and aji amarillo. Mains cast a wider net, letting Robson explore his Vietnamese heritage a bit with fresh spring rolls or caldo de pollo — chicken pho in disguise on a Mexican menu. Spanish and New Mexican influences play stronger as well. And if you’ve been skipping the burgers because who gets burgers at a Mexican restaurant, you’ve been making a huge mistake. They’re some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 6035 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

It would be easy to say a chef like Urciuoli belongs in the kitchen of a fine-dining restaurant, but he’s after something bigger. Pa’La is culinary populism at work, a declaration of war on the notion that premium ingredients and refined presentations should be reserved for the well-heeled. At Pa’La, a spartan counter-service joint in a blue-collar neighborhood, Urciuoli serves simple tapas composed of perfect ingredients. The Italian native pairs imported mozzarella and burrata with roasted vegetables. He bakes bread to order and fills it with roasted wood-grilled skate wing and sizzled Spanish sausage. And he tops his Ramon Navarro bowl — a blend of ancient grains, beans, nuts and seeds dressed with premium oils and vinegars — with whatever smoky, charred seafood strikes his fancy that day. Put these dishes on fine china instead of paper plates, add a ritzy room and service staff, and he could charge quadruple the price. But that would be missing the point, wouldn’t it?\n\nDetails: 2107 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Restaurateur Aric Mei — also involved in the forthcoming Los Olivos Farm project — has become something of an urban farming evangelist. So nearly a decade into its run, The Parlor has gone from neighborhood Italian restaurant to a working lab where Mei tries to practice what he preaches. On the surface, this is any old casual, contemporary Italian joint, slinging pizza, pasta and salads. But something as simple as lightly sweet caponata bruschetta sings, supported by excellent produce and careful balance. Salads based on mixed greens, usually a throwaway, are atypically bright and crisp. Pastas with substantial bite are generously dressed with rich ragus. And the pizzas, a light and chewy variety, are smartly dressed. Sausage is fine, but sausage with grilled radicchio and sage is compelling. A pizza puttanesca laden with tender, spicy seafood is a delight. And when summer rolls around, the sweet pop of roasted corn and chiles with a touch of spicy crema is impossible to resist.\n\nDetails: 1916 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

Husband-and-wife team Walleye Lai and Tina Truong started by selling exotic fruit from the back of a van before moving the operation to Winglee Market, a partnership with a California poultry farm that specializes in breeds of chickens popular with Asian chefs. These stellar birds make the Truongs’ lightly seasoned chicken pho some of the best in town. But there’s a lot more to Pho Winglee, the market’s next-door companion restaurant. Fried chicken wings are piping hot, paper-crisp and encased in a salty-sweet fish sauce lacquer. Grilled meats served with broken rice are tender and juicy. Rice vermicelli is topped with perfect spring rolls; shrimp paste wrapped in lacy crisp tofu skin and sweet, smoky slivers of pork. Pho Winglee isn’t substantially different from other Vietnamese spots that dot the landscape. But it’s fresher, crisper and more flavorful than the rest.\n\nDetails: 111 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

It’s tempting to tell the whippersnappers to remember their history. Sure, it’s everywhere now, but this kind of pizza didn’t exist in this town before Bianco. I want to respect differences of opinion, while digging into one of Bianco’s pies, but I find it hard to accept that the anti-hype is anything but pure contrarianism. This is outstanding pizza with a depth of flavor built on heritage grains and a crisp and craggy character forged in the wood oven, simply topped with vibrant ingredients expressed at their peak. What’s more, at the Town & Country location, the pasta may be even better. Bianco is as much an ethos as a name, one that reveres local agriculture, seeks to extract the most from every ingredient and is constantly seeking honesty, both from the dishes themselves and the people who make them. It’s all right there on the plate.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 623 E. Adams St., Phoenix, 602-258-8300. MAP IT!

But it has evolved into something more — a local restaurant group that has harnessed popular Italian fare and elevated its integrity without sacrificing its broad appeal. Restaurateur Stefano Fabbri runs a boisterous, contemporary establishment. His collection of wood-fired pizzas and fresh pastas is a delectable, never-ending work in progress that pushes diners just a little bit further with each successive year. VPN-certified (that’s food geek speak for “hardcore traditional”) Neapolitan pizzas, such as the margherita and bufala verace, do a fine job of conveying the style’s chewy countenance, bubbling cornicone and straightforward adornment. But less conventional items like the charred, paper-thin, Rimini-style pizzas and the cheese-stuffed focaccia di Recco can steal the show from the main event, and Pomo slings a mean lasagna to boot.\n\nDetails: 8977 N.

More to the point, Dustin Christofolo is helping purge the antiquated notions of desert cuisine from our systems, replacing them with something gorgeously delicate and refined, and grown — to a large extent — right on the property’s farm. The charming farmhouse and some of the most serene, romantic outdoor dining around would make this a popular destination even if the kitchen were in shambles. Thankfully, it’s quite the opposite. Christofolo shares creations that border on ethereal, such as uni removed from its usual umami bomb context and offset instead by light, pickled kohlrabi, grapefruit and meringue. His beef carpaccio, on crisp bread spoons with tempura-fried herbs and a light blue cheese aioli, borders on precious. Even a tangle of sausage-studded cappellacci is lightened with cauliflower, spigarello and a whiff of tarragon. The rest of the world may see the surrounding country as a harsh, if beautiful, wasteland. But here is food that gives a stage to the fruits of the desert more rarely seen and appreciated.\n\nDetails: The Farm at South Mountain, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix.

She opened this Scottsdale institution nearly 25 years ago, but unlike so many moldering relics of the era that now feel clumsy and dated, Rancho Pinot is as fresh and relevant as any newcomer to the scene. Filled with California- and Italian-influenced classics you can ease into like a worn leather chair, the menu’s focus on pure flavor, unfussy presentations and classic comforts is at once timeless and squarely on trend. A round of house-pulled burrata is a rich and creamy morsel, whether paired with a stone fruit relish or swimming in a roasted tomato broth. Grilled quail are succulent and sweet; and delicate gnocchi are nestled into a rich lamb ragu. But Nonni’s Sunday chicken, simply braised with mushrooms and white wine and paired with crisp polenta, exemplifies Rancho Pinot’s appeal. Restaurants new and old struggle to show this kind of grace and maturity in their food, but Robertson, as always, makes it look easy.\n\nDetails: 6208 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

Fortunately, it’s an enviable one. Reathrey Sekong is the kind of charming and tasty spot that food geeks dream of opening. Mother-and-son team Lakhana and Yuth In serve a list of Khmer specialties even more colorful and vibrant than the surroundings, which is saying something given the room’s neon paint job. Pleah, a Cambodian salad made here with marinated raw beef, is a light and pungent affair, cool and plied with fresh herbs. Soups are superb, in particular a lemongrass-scented number with coconut and a touch of tangy tamarind to lend a bracing sourness. The Phnom Penh noodle soup, fortified with pork liver and intestines, is offally good (sorry). For those less inclined toward organ eatery, the lok lak beef is tender stir-fried beef in a French-influenced sauce. But my favorite might be the humble cha kreung, simple chicken stir-fried with a seasoning paste pounded so fresh you can pick out the individual flavors of lemongrass, ginger, galangal, lime leaf, turmeric, shallot, garlic, chiles... every single component.\n\nDetails: 1312 E.

Alejandro Bonilla’s family is indigenous to the region, and he shares them from a modest, cozy storefront joint in west Mesa. Restaurant Huauchinangos slings some of the usual fare you’ll find at any local Mexican restaurant, but what makes Huauchinangos distinctive is dishes like the molotes, 3-inch masa torpedoes stuffed with potato and chorizo, fried to a golden crisp and drenched with tomatillo salsa. The quesadillas are folded over fillings like chicken tinga or mushrooms and cheese, then fried to a delicate crisp, tender to the touch and molten at their core. Bonilla’s “huauchitlacoyos” — a portmanteau of Huauchinango and tlacoyos — are piled with cactus and smoky salsa mora and excellent paired with salty, seared cesina. And chicken is usually a winner, whether it’s Bonilla’s family recipe for mole, a swirling mix of spices, chiles and nuts; or served con cacahuate — smothered with a sauce made of crispy chopped peanuts with the intense, fruity sting of dried chiltepin chiles.\n\nDetails: 1620 E.

Thankfully, at Roka Akor, that’s not a bad thing. This swanky joint with a Scottsdale nightlife vibe is in a part of town where it could have easily coasted on image alone. But there is compelling work being done here with ultra-superior ingredients, including some of the city’s best nigiri sushi, a compact list made with slabs of premium fish, delicate rice and real wasabi. Creative sashimi are also strong, like butterfish tataki wrapped around crisp white asparagus with a touch of herb and yuzu. The miso-marinated black cod is a refined take on the izakaya staple. And I’m more than a little enamored of their slabs of tender sweet potato with a hefty dose of binchotan-induced char and a ginger-laced glaze. But you most likely came for the steaks, and they’re excellent, whether a charred rib eye with a soy vinaigrette, juicy skirt steaks with an herbal shiso chimichurri or imported Japanese beef that inhabits “if you have to ask” territory. Heck, even the beef and kimchi gyoza are sharp, a compelling take on a dish that’s usually a throwaway, even when it isn’t frozen.\n\nDetails: 7299 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

In a charming, refurbished space built from the bones of a historic Chinese market, Bianco has teamed with Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez of Tacos Chiwas to open what could be best described as an Italian-influenced Chihuahuan diner. In practice, that means flaky cabeza empanadas with an earthy garbanzo bean dip; cheesy entomatadas bathed in the essence of summer tomatoes; chile colorado with the desert’s smoky, fiery sting; and “quesadillas” that look like pizzas, taste like Mexico and resemble precisely no other quesadilla you’ve ever tasted. Best part? Killer ingredients at Denny’s prices. Holguin is the backbone here, and with the sourcing and support provided by Bianco and Hernandez, this is the kind of simple, bold new Arizona cuisine that’s getting Mexican chefs out of the depths of the kitchen and into the spotlight, where they belong.\n\nDetails: 1505 E.

Levine’s 2-year-old solo venture, however, is another story. Sel has the look of a slick Scottsdale lounge, an intimate room done in crystal and purple velour with a gently thumping soundtrack. The menu’s structure is four-course prix fixe that gets a top-to-bottom refresh almost monthly, a collection of refined dishes that change with the seasons and Levine’s whims. A bit of American brashness meets European sensibilities while drawing in flavors from around the world. Scallop ceviche enriched with uni panna cotta bathes in a smoky, dashi rich broth. A gorgeous grilled langoustine tops Thai-inspired sausage with the gentle sourness of fermented rice. Risotto prepared with phytoplankton is a deep-green chlorophyll bomb.

These are the best of those moments:\n\n11. Packers rescue Rodgers from green room in 2005 draft\n\nDate: April 23, 2005\n\nRodgers' tenure with the Packers started in the most humbling way ... he was the last player remaining in the green room at the draft. Projected as one of the top picks, Rodgers dropped after his hometown San Francisco 49ers selected Utah quarterback Alex Smith with the No. 1 overall selection. For more than four hours, Rodgers sat in the green room as TV cameras captured his humiliation for a national audience. Finally, with the No. 24 overall pick, the Packers rescued Rodgers. The Packers' selection of Rodgers was a no-brainer. By early 2005, then-quarterback Brett Favre already had hinted at retirement. Rodgers would be the heir apparent, but it would take three years before earning the starting job.\n\n10. Rodgers breaks Favre's TD record\n\nDate: Dec. 25, 2021\n\nGame: Week 16, Packers vs. Cleveland Browns\n\nIn the first quarter of a 24-22 win over the Browns on Christmas Day at legendary Lambeau Field, Rodgers connected with Allen Lazard for an 11-yard scoring play that gave Rodgers his 443rd career touchdown pass. That broke the franchise record previously held by Favre, who had 508 career touchdown passes but 442 with the Packers.\n\n9. Rodgers wins fourth MVP award\n\nDate: Feb. 10, 2022\n\nAt the 11th annual NFL Honors ceremony, Rodgers won his fourth MVP award (2011, 2014, 2020, 2021), which is the second-most in NFL history behind Peyton Manning's five. Rodgers also broke a tie at three MVP awards with Tom Brady, Jim Brown, Brett Favre and Johnny Unitas. In 2021, Rodgers threw for 4,115 yards; his 10th season throwing for 4,000 or more yards. He had 37 touchdown passes; his eighth season with 30 or more touchdown passes. Probably most impressive was that he threw just four interceptions in 531 attempts.\n\n8. Rodgers 'owns' the Bears\n\nDate: Oct. 17, 2021\n\nGame: Week 6, Packers vs. Chicago Bears\n\nThanks in large part to the Favre-Rodgers quarterbacking lineage, the Packers have dominated their ancient rivals for nearly a quarter century. When Favre arrived in Green Bay in 1992, the Bears held a seemingly impossible-to-overcome 24-win edge over the Packers in the NFL's most-storied rivalry. The Packers now own a 105-95-6 edge, with Rodgers winning his last eight against Chicago. That dominance had a viral moment during the 2021 season, when Rodgers taunted Bears fans at Soldier Field by yelling \"I still own you!\" in a 24-14 win. In Rodgers' final game against the Bears on Dec. 4, 2022, the two teams entered the contest tied for the most all-time wins at 786. With a 28-19 win, the Packers wrestled the all-time wins record away from the Bears, who had held the record since 1921. Rodgers finished his Packers career by going 25-5 in starts (including postseason) against the Bears.\n\n7. Rodgers pulls off the improbable in playoff game vs. Cardinals\n\nDate: Jan. 16, 2016\n\nGame: 2015 NFC divisional playoff, Packers vs. Arizona Cardinals\n\nIn a thrilling playoff game in Arizona, the Packers were down 20-13 with 50 seconds remaining and facing a fourth-and-20 situation. Rodgers pulled off the first of a series of improbable plays en route to tying the game and forcing overtime. Rodgers connected with Jeff Janis for a 60-yard play. With 4 seconds remaining, Rodgers and Janis connected again, this time for a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown that forced overtime. It took the Cardinals just three plays to win the game, however. First, Larry Fitzgerald hauled in a Carson Palmer pass and ran to the Packers' 5-yard line for a 75-yard gain. After an incomplete pass to Fitzgerald, Palmer flipped a pass to Fitzgerald, who ran into the end zone to secure the wild win.\n\n6. The 'Miracle in Motown'\n\nDate: Dec. 2, 2015\n\nGame: Week 13, Packers vs. Detroit Lions\n\nDown 23-21 at their own 39-yard line with no time remaining, the Packers pulled off an improbable win on \"Thursday Night Football.\" Rodgers rolled right and unfurled a Hail Mary to the end zone, where Richard Rodgers came down with the winning catch in a 27-23 victory. The Packers had overcome a 20-point second-half deficit in the win. One of the most interesting historical footnotes about the play was Richard Rodgers' involvement. It's important to note that Richard Rodgers' father — Richard Rodgers — was a part of the famous Cal-Stanford play. Richard Rodgers (the father) tossed two of the five laterals during the impossible dream of a play pulled off by Cal in 1982.\n\n5. Rodgers' clutch pass dooms Dallas in playoff game\n\nDate: Jan. 15, 2017\n\nGame: NFC divisional playoff, Packers vs. Dallas Cowboys\n\nOnce up 21-3 on the Cowboys, the Packers had seen their lead evaporate but had possession with the game tied at 31 and 30-plus seconds remaining. The Packers did gain 17 yards on a pass to Ty Montgomery, but lost 10 yards on a sack. The Packers faced a third-and-20 situation from their own 32-yard line with 12 seconds remaining. Rodgers rolled out to his left and heaved a pass down the sideline to Jared Cook, who was able to simultaneously haul in the football and drag his toes for a completion. The 35-yard gain put the ball on the Cowboys' 33-yard line, and kicker Mason Crosby booted the 51-yard field goal as time expired for the spectacular win. After seemingly spending their life-force earning this win, the Packers were routed in the NFC championship game by the Atlanta Falcons, who famously went on to blow a 28-3 lead against the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.\n\n4. Packers win NFC North with epic final play vs. Bears\n\nDate: Dec. 29, 2013\n\nGame: Week 17, Packers vs. Chicago Bears\n\nThe Packers (7-7-1) and Bears (8-7) met in a de facto NFC North championship game at Soldier Field, and it came down to completing three fourth-down plays in the final minute to pull off a dramatic victory. Facing a fourth-and-8 from the Bears' 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Randall Cobb for a game-winning touchdown that clinched the division title.\n\n3. Rodgers impressive in relief of Favre\n\nDate: Nov. 29, 2007\n\nGame: Week 13, Packers vs. Dallas Cowboys\n\nIn a huge \"Thursday Night Football\" showdown between the 10-1 Packers and 10-1 Cowboys at Texas Stadium, starter Brett Favre injured his throwing arm in the second quarter and Rodgers was pressed into action with the NFC's best record on the line. Rodgers entered the game with the Packers down 27-10 and despite a 37-27 defeat, Rodgers was impressive coming off the bench. Rodgers threw his first career touchdown pass (to Greg Jennings) and finished the game completing 18 of 26 passes for 201 yards. It was this performance that assured the Packers and their fans that Rodgers could actually be a suitable follow-up to Favre. During the 2008 offseason, a messy divorce between the Packers and Favre resulted in a trade of the team legend to the New York Jets.\n\n2. Breakthrough performance vs. Falcons in 2010 playoffs\n\nDate: Jan. 15, 2011\n\nGame: 2010 NFC divisional playoffs, Packers vs. Atlanta Falcons\n\nA week after collecting his first NFL postseason victory — a 21-16 triumph over the Philadelphia Eagles — Rodgers had a breakthrough performance in a playoff game for the ages. Rodgers threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Packers routed the NFC's top seed, 48-21, in the highest-scoring playoff game in Packers history. The Packers would win three road playoff games — including defeating the rival Chicago Bears in the NFC championship game — to reach Super Bowl 45.\n\n1. Packers win Super Bowl 45, Rodgers is game MVP\n\nDate: Feb. 6, 2011\n\nGame: Super Bowl 45, Packers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nIn a clash of two of the NFL's flagship franchises, the Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-25. Rodgers completed 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns, and earned game MVP honors. This Super Bowl win came in just Rodgers' third season as a full-time starter. At 27 years old with a long and successful career seemingly ahead of him, this Super Bowl seemed like it could be the first of multiple titles won by Rodgers. Instead, the next decade-plus would feature an agonizing series of postseason disappointments.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jets/2023/03/07/aaron-rodgers-jets-trade-talks-packers/11419947002/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers, Jets?

It's turning into cheese sauce.\"\n\nHall said Rodgers \"might as well make that move\" because \"you see what you have over here,\" referring to the trio of talented rookies and Jets' future.\n\nWatch the full video below:\n\nThe Packers and New York Jets have had discussions on Rodgers this week, and Jets leadership, including owner Woody Johnson flew to California, to meet with Rodgers.\n\nAs the wait continues for resolution on Rodgers' future, Packers president Mark Murphy seemed to further indicate the franchise is ready to move on from the four-time NFL MVP.\n\nWhen asked during an interview with WBAY-TV in Wisconsin on Friday whether Rodgers could play again for the Packers next season, Murphy said, “Yeah, I mean, unless, if things don’t work out the way that we would want them. Yeah, he is obviously a great player.”\n\nContributing: Safid Deen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2023/04/25/aaron-rodgers-trade-grades-by-national-writers-for-packers-and-jets/70150518007/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers trade grades by national writers for Packers and Jets", "text": "Nearly 24 hours after the Green Bay Packers reportedly finished off a trade to send Aaron Rodgers to the New York Jets for draft compensation, the reaction from around the internet has started to trickle in.\n\nTake a look at how national writers are breaking down the transaction, often by offering grades for both sides.\n\nThere's a lot to like for the Packers' return in the trade\n\nGarrett Podell of CBS writes that both teams get what they want. He gives Green Bay the grade of \"A.\"\n\n\"Gutekunst being able to procure a first-round pick swap, the Jets' highest second round pick (No. 42 overall), sixth-round pick (No. 207 overall), and a conditional 2024 second-round selection that becomes a first if Rodgers plays 65 percent of New York's offensive plays is a massive victory,\" Podell wrote. \"Green Bay getting three top-two-round selections, one being a first-round pick swap, for a Rodgers that turns 40 in December as he's coming off arguably his worst NFL season is all they could hope for. Plus, the Packers don't have to pick up the tab on his $58.3 million guaranteed contract option, a relief for their salary cap.\"\n\nJeff Howe of The Athletic gathered five GMs, executives and assistant coaches, and three of the five felt it was a victory for the Packers, while a fourth saw it as a win-win.\n\n“(Rodgers is a) descending player who didn’t want to be (with the Packers) and will probably retire this year if things don’t go well,” one executive said. “I could see this blowing up in the Jets’ faces.”\n\nJoseph Acosta of SBNation felt the Packers won the trade. \"Moving up two spots in this years’ draft is small potatoes; their board probably doesn’t change that much when it comes to this years’ draft,\" he said. \"Getting a second round pick that high in the draft is great as well, but I think what makes this haul an A is getting that conditional second to turn into a first if Rodgers plays 65 percent of the snaps.\"\n\nMost of the writers were handing out As for the Pack.\n\nMatt Verderame of Sports Illustrated: A-minus. \"Ultimately, this is a new era for the Packers. After having 31 seasons of Brett Favre and Rodgers, Green Bay is moving into a new unknown. Gutekunst now has a year to evaluate Love before deciding whether he wants to look for another option or commit to the former 2020 first-round pick.\"\n\nVinnie Iyer of The Sporting News: A (though he gave the Jets an A-plus). \"The Packers kept falling short of the Super Bowl with Rodgers of late despite being a mighty playoff team before '22. It was time to turn the page and shoot for a different kind of ceiling at the intersection of a reload and rebuild. Now they are assisted by big extra draft capital. ... Given the recent work of both front offices and coaching staffs, it's easy to trust this is the rare trade that will deliver big returns for both teams, the Jets in the short term and the Packers in the long term.\"\n\nDallas Robinson of Pro Football Focus: A. \"Green Bay was backed into a corner — they had already talked about Rodgers in the past tense, and there was no way they could have him return to the team at this point. But they still walked away with an excellent package in exchange for Rodgers that will allow them to add talent around new starting quarterback Jordan Love. With Rodgers gone, Green Bay will have more than $54 million in cap space in 2024 — and that’s before they make decisions on veterans like David Bakhtiari, Aaron Jones, and Preston Smith.\"\n\nThe draft compensation is favorable to Green Bay\n\nBill Barnwell of ESPN does some math to try and gauge the value of the conditional draft pick in the mix.\n\n\"I would guess Rodgers has a 75% chance of making it to that snap total (65% for the conditional pick to become a first-rounder), and the Jets win about 10 games next season,\" Barnwell said. \"In that scenario, they would owe Green Bay something like the 22nd pick in a typical draft. Teams typically discount future picks by about a round, so you might instead choose to value this as something more like a 2023 second-rounder. There's no right answer.\n\n\"If we treat that conditional pick as the 22nd selection with no discount, this would amount to a significant return for the Packers. The Jets would be sending 2,418 points of draft value on the Jimmy Johnson chart to the Packers and getting 1,073 points in return. The difference is 1,345 points, which amounts to pick No. 9 in a typical draft.\n\n\"Is that too much to pay for a 39-year-old quarterback making more than all but one other player in NFL history?\n\nSeth Walder of ESPN gave the Packers an A-minus for the deal considering the draft compensation.\n\n\"Even if we assume the 2024 selection in this trade is a mid-second-round pick, by our AV-based draft value chart, the Packers traded Rodgers for something like the equivalent of a No. 10 overall pick (if we don't discount future year selections),\" he wrote. \"In all likelihood, though, that 2024 pick will become a first-round selection, making this trade even more valuable for Green Bay.\n\n\"Think about it this way. In a vacuum, Rodgers doesn't offer substantial surplus value over his contract because he's already paid at the peak of the quarterback market. In theory, that means he should be worth little in terms of draft capital. It made sense the Jets would still be willing to give up something to acquire him because of the circumstances. (He was probably the best player available and it gave them Super Bowl aspirations.) But the Jets didn't give up just something — they dealt major trade compensation.\"\n\nBut there were still some drawbacks for the Packers\n\nJudy Battista of NFL.com gauged the winners and losers. She mentioned the Packers among the trade's winners… but also its losers, and she also put the Packers fans in the latter category.\n\n\"Rodgers started for 15 seasons, winning four league MVPs … and the Packers have just one Super Bowl title to show for that excellence,\" she wrote. \"There is no shortage of blame to go around — a portion is reserved for Rodgers — but the organization bears some responsibility for not doing everything it could to give the quarterback the necessary teammates and coaches to take advantage of his best years.\n\n\"Between Favre and Rodgers, Packer backers have enjoyed three decades of extraordinary quarterback play. Neither player minded drama, and the annual late-career will-he-or-won't-he musings could grow tiresome for a segment of the fan base. But those who were ready to move on should be careful what they wish for. Love may turn out to be just as good, but at least for now, Cheeseheads are thrust into the same netherworld of quarterback uncertainty that much of the league endures every year.\"\n\nNate Davis of USA Today called the Packers a winner of the trade in the long term but called Brian Gutekunst one of the trade's losers, as well as coach Matt LaFleur.\n\n\"Though managing Rodgers' ego clearly became too much, the Green Bay GM's ability to communicate with his locker room – and its best player – has to come under some scrutiny given the way this all went down,\" Davis wrote. \"And with Rodgers leaving Wisconsin, sure could become a lot more challenging to lure free agents to the land of Cheeseheads, especially if Love stumbles.\"\n\nAbout LaFleur, Davis said: \"The Green Bay coach, who won 13 regular-season games and the NFC North each of his first three seasons before a descent to 8-9 in 2022, will now truly have to earn some serious sideline stripes in the post-Rodgers era.\"\n\nWas Rodgers the best player in Packers history? One writer doesn't think so\n\nJarrett Bell of USA Today wants it to be known that Rodgers was not the franchise \"GOAT.\"\n\n\"Bart Starr (two Super Bowl victories, five NFL championships), field general of Lombardi’s dynasty teams in the 1960s, still gets the nod over Brett Favre in my book as the greatest player in Packers history, even though Starr played in the era before the passing game took over,\" Bell wrote.\n\n\"Yes, you can call Rodgers the greatest passer in Packers history, especially when considering how reckless the gunslinging Favre was. But Rodgers’ legacy also includes the reality that while often hailed as the NFL’s most talented quarterback, he never gave Tom Brady a run for his money in collecting Super Bowl rings.\n\n\"Rodgers knows. Or maybe not. There’s a lot of gray area in the Green Bay GOAT department.\"\n\nNancy Armour of USA Today believes Rodgers didn't realize how good he had it in Green Bay.\n\n\"But the first game Rodgers throws multiple interceptions, blames his receivers or offensive line for a mistake that was clearly his, or makes a snide comment he thinks is too clever for the masses to get, he’ll learn very quickly that he’s lost his Packers security blanket,\" she said.\n\n\"His relationship with the Jets, and their fans, is transactional. They expect the four-time MVP to make them contenders in the AFC East and beyond, and if he can’t deliver – at 39, it’s really more of a when – they will turn on him in a way Rodgers can’t even fathom after spending his entire career in the cocoon that is Green Bay.\n\nFrom the Jets perspective...\n\nKevin Clark of The Ringer is skeptical that the move makes the Jets a true Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"I do not think the addition of Rodgers makes the Jets top-shelf AFC contenders like the Chiefs, Bengals, or Bills—or particularly close to that level right now—but it gives them a pathway toward that,\" he said. \"Anything is better than (Zach) Wilson, and if Rodgers plays as even the 16th-best QB in the league, the literal middle of the pack, that will probably be enough to deliver a young, talented roster to the playoffs. Hell, the Jets almost got there last season despite Wilson.\"\n\nAndrew Brandt, formerly an employee of the Packers who knows Rodgers from their time in Green Bay, pointed out that the lack of an owner in Green Bay might have been a factor in the outcome.\n\nThe New York Post also had Rodgers on its front and back page Tuesday morning.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2023/03/15/aaron-rodgers-new-york-jets-green-bay-packers-trade/11273168002/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers wants to play for Jets, rips Packers for communication", "text": "As if Aaron Rodgers' inextricable linkage to Brett Favre wasn't pronounced enough, their football parallels continue to grow.\n\nAppearing on \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" Wednesday, Rodgers revealed his intention to continue playing football in 2023 – for the New York Jets, not the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe four-time NFL MVP said he arrived at that conclusion last week, deciding: \"At this point, as I sit here, ya know, I think since Friday, I've made it clear that my intention was to play. And my intention was to play for the New York Jets. And I haven't been holding anything up at this point – it's been compensation that the Packers are trying to get for me, and kinda digging their heels in.\"\n\nRodgers' interview almost exactly coincided with the opening of the league's 2023 free agent market, new signings and trades able to officially be executed at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nRodgers, who succeeded Favre as Green Bay's starter in 2008, is now waiting for a deal to be consummated. Ironically, the Packers dealt three-time league MVP Favre to the Jets 15 years ago to make way for Rodgers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pack will now presumably try to reset with 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love behind center.\n\n\"They want to move on, and now so do I,\" said Rodgers, while relaying the impression he received throughout the 2022 season was that it would be his last in Wisconsin.\n\nAfter receiving permission to speak with the Jets, he met with team brass at his Malibu home.\n\nRodgers said, \"We had a nice conversation.\"\n\nHe also expounded on his well-publicized \"darkness retreat\" last month.\n\n\"The darkness gave me a lot of time to contemplate everything,\" Rodgers said from his Southern California home, explaining he craved the isolation after completing his 18th season – one in which the Packers came up one win short of the playoffs after a belated push following their 4-8 start in 2022. It was the first time the Pack had missed postseason since 2018.\n\n\"I'm really thankful for that time in the darkness,\" he said.\n\nHe said going into the experience, he was 90% sure he would retire this offseason and that the Packers had expressed that they wanted him to retire as a member of the team but that the door was \"wide open\" had he wanted to continue playing for them.\n\nBut he added that when he emerged from the darkness, \"something changed\" as he learned that the only franchise he has played for was apparently more interested in moving on from him than he felt like they had previously let on, a turn that apparently spurred his desire to continue his career.\n\n\"This isn't a decision day,\" Rodgers, 39, said regarding his professional future even as the NFL community has breathlessly awaited an update all week.\n\n\"This isn't me deciding, announcing to the world that this is what's going on. In fact, that's already happened. We're actually days past this. This is kind of clearing things up, I think, for everybody interested.\"\n\nRodgers insisted he wasn't a victim despite the organizational change of heart but conceded he was hoping for more transparency from the front office.\n\n\"Nobody's bled green and gold like me,\" said Rodgers, the longest-tenured player in club history. \"I love that city. I love those fans. I love that region.\"\n\nAfter meeting with the Jets, Rodgers wanted to get back into workout mode before making any determination on his next steps. But his body and mind responded well.\n\nRodgers also refuted an ESPN report that he provided a list of players, including Odell Beckham Jr. and close friend Randall Cobb, he wanted the Jets to sign.\n\n\"It's so stupid to think I would do that,\" he said.\n\nHowever New York did reach a four-year agreement with receiver Allen Lazard, Rodgers' teammate the past five seasons, on Tuesday.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe Packers and Jets must not only agree to trade compensation – presumably involving a draft pick or picks and possibly players – but Rodgers will also have to rework his contract.\n\nA trade was his only viable path out of Green Bay, though dealing him will still cause the Packers to incur a $40 million dead cap charge. Still, that's significantly less penal than the untenable $100 million dead money charge that would have resulted by releasing him. Rodgers is currently owed a $58.3 million option before the start of the 2023 regular season, though he's previously admitted any trade would necessitate a restructuring of his existing arrangement. The Jets would certainly need some financial flexibility on his part to squeeze Rodgers into their salary-cap structure.\n\nAn NFL legend\n\nA four-time league MVP recipient (2011, 2014, 2020, 2021), Rodgers trails only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, who won five, in that department. Rodgers was also the MVP of Super Bowl 45, when he passed for 304 yards and three touchdowns against the Pittsburgh Steelers during his only appearance on Super Sunday. His 103.6 regular-season passer rating ranks second all-time to Patrick Mahomes (105.7).\n\nA Packers legend\n\nRodgers' 475 regular-season TD passes are the most in Green Bay history and 33 shy of Favre for fourth place on the all-time NFL list. Rodgers finished the 2022 season 2,600 yards and 13 wins short of matching Favre's Pack marks. However both only won a single Lombardi Trophy for the NFL's winningest franchise, though Favre led the franchise to both Super Bowl 31, a victory, and a narrow loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 32.\n\nPoor in the postseason\n\nWhile Rodgers has proven himself one of the greatest and most talented quarterbacks in regular-season history, his relative lack of success in the playoffs relegates him a tier below the likes of Tom Brady, Joe Montana and even two-time Super Bowl MVP Mahomes. Rodgers' 45 career postseason TD passes are one more than Favre and tied with Montana for second most all-time ... behind Brady's 88. Rodgers' 11-10 record in playoff games includes four losses in the NFC championship game.\n\nInauspicious start\n\nThis spring will mark 18 years since Rodgers was selected 24th overall by the Packers in the 2005 draft. The Northern California native, projected that year as a potential No. 1 pick by the San Francisco 49ers – they picked Utah quarterback Alex Smith instead – infamously waited for hours in the green room, passed over another 22 times before Green Bay ended his free fall ... only so he could sit behind Favre for the next three seasons.\n\nFuture in flux\n\nLike Favre, Rodgers openly pondered his football future during the latter stage of his career. Love's selection in the 2020 draft seemed to spark a Rodgers resurgence after what was – by his standards – a subpar stretch of seasons from 2017 to 2019. Toward the end of the 2020 campaign, when Rodgers earned his third MVP trophy, he said: \"My future is a beautiful mystery.\" He skipped the club's 2021 offseason but returned for training camp and embarked on his fourth MVP effort. Last year, he agreed to a three-year, $151 million extension but still skipped most of an offseason that included the departure All-Pro receiver and close friend Davante Adams.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/sports-betting/2023/03/15/jets-super-bowl-odds-2023-aaron-rodgers-trade-afc/70006784007/", "title": "Jets Super Bowl odds 2023 following Aaron Rodgers trade", "text": "After weeks of rumors and speculation, quarterback Aaron Rodgers went on the Pat McAfee Show Wednesday and announced his plans to play for the New York Jets next season despite a deal not being confirmed by either side yet.\n\nWithout star wide receiver Davante Adams, the 2020-21 and 2021-22 MVP took a step back last year as he threw for only 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, the most since his first year as a starter in 2008.\n\nSo what are the Jets odds to win Super Bowl LVIII, the AFC and their own division?

It's been 18 years since Rodgers' infamous tumble in the 2005 draft, when he seemed a very likely candidate to be the No. 1 pick ... before going 24th to the Packers. Two years ago, just hours before the 2021 draft started, reports surfaced that Rodgers wanted out of Green Bay. He ultimately stayed and added another MVP award, but that clearly signaled the likelihood his legendary career would not end in green and gold.\n\nNow this.\n\nAnd, sure, by finally reaching middle ground Monday, the Jets and Packers can now focus on their draft boards without the Rodgers specter lurking over Thursday and/or Friday nights. Still, this transaction, expected as it was, marks a seismic shift to the NFL landscape and seems to further shift the balance of power to the AFC.\n\nA breakdown of the winners and losers of the AR12 – AR8? – deal:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT:Aaron Rodgers trade shakes up first-round outlook\n\nWINNERS\n\nNew York Jets in the short term: They have their best quarterback ... since Brett Favre in 2008? Joe Namath in 1968? The best quarterback they've ever had? Rodgers is only a year removed from being the back-to-back league MVP but certainly had some falloff last year – which can be forgiven when a 39-year-old is playing through a broken thumb on his passing hand while trying to adapt to the absence of close friend and WR1 Davante Adams. Now Rodgers joins a roster that he officially mints as Super Bowl-caliber ... yes, the New ... York ... Jets – their new QB1 theoretically the missing piece as Tom Brady was for the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Matthew Stafford was for the 2021 Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAnd don't forget, head coach Robert Saleh had last year's NYJ edition at 7-4 – including a 27-10 smackdown of the Packers at Lambeau Field on Oct. 16 – after Week 12 and in the thick of the AFC playoff race. But New York didn't win another game during the 2022 season – despite having both NFL rookies of the year in CB Sauce Gardner and WR Garrett Wilson, plus All-Pro DT Quinnen Williams and an otherwise competitive roster. The Jets essentially devolved into a hockey team playing short-handed all the time, almost completely scuttled by their ineffective quarterback play, on the way to another last-place finish in the AFC East.\n\nGreen Bay Packers in the long run: As great as Rodgers was for them – even though, like Favre, he only brought one championship – it had become apparent it was time for the sides to go their separate ways rather than their mutually endure another offseason (and maybe even regular-season) sideshow. Now the Pack move forward with 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love, better armed to augment his supporting cast in hopes he can extend the organization's quarterbacking loyalty, which extends from Rodgers back to Favre and to Bart Starr and even 1930s star Arnie Herber.\n\nJoe Douglas: The Jets general manager whiffed on QB Zach Wilson with the No. 2 pick of the 2021 draft after failing to cobble together enough help for Sam Darnold, the quarterback Douglas inherited when he was hired in 2019. But Joe D. finally seems to have an answer for Rodgers and – potentially – has set up the Jets for their first serious Super Bowl push in more than a decade. At the least, he's certainly positioned them to break the league's longest playoff drought, which currently stands at a dozen years. And Douglas didn't have to give up the farm, basically enduring the net loss of two second-rounders (unless Rodgers plays 65% of the snaps this season and elevates one into a Round 1 choice in 2024), a package he nicely prepared ... more on that later.\n\nJoe Namath: The only quarterback to ever lead the Jets to the Super Bowl – the legendary upset of the Baltimore Colts following the 1968 season – \"Broadway Joe\" had given Rodgers his blessing to wear his retired No. 12, the one Rodgers had rocked for the entirety of his time in Green Bay. But, per ESPN, Rodgers will revert to the No. 8 he starred in at Cal and leave Namath's signature digits in the rafters.\n\nMike Greenberg: ESPN's star morning anchor – and an avowed, if paranoid, Jets fan – now gets to sleep easy ... for the next three or four months.\n\nPackers-Jets QB pipeline: Fifteen years after Favre was shipped to Gang Green, Rodgers follows the same path. Favre only stayed one season and played hurt (and poorly) down the stretch in 2008 as a highly promising start fizzled short of postseason. Jets fans will be hoping for far more from Rodgers ... and certainly a two-year stay (at least), similar to former NYJ QB2 Mark Brunell, who began his estimable career in a similar role with Green Bay.\n\nQuarterback conference: Rodgers jumps to the AFC, joining Bills QB Josh Allen, Bengals QB Joe Burrow, Chargers QB Justin Herbert, Ravens QB (??) Lamar Jackson, Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence, Chiefs QB (and reigning MVP) Patrick Mahomes, Browns QB Deshaun Watson and Broncos QB Russell Wilson. What a list! And to think at least two of them will be postseason also-rans in 2023.\n\nNathaniel Hackett: The Jets' recently hired offensive coordinator held the same post in Green Bay when Rodgers won his past two MVP trophies and clearly has the veteran's faith. Hackett should also be able to craft a smooth-ish transition – at least on the field – as the Jets get used to their new quarterback and playbook, one Rodgers is already intimately familiar with. And who knows? Maybe things go well enough to get Hackett another crack at an HC job after his disastrous stint with the Denver Broncos last year.\n\nConnor McGovern: Talk about timing. Monday morning, the Jets' starting center for the past three seasons re-signed with the team, ensuring at least 80% of last year's starters will be lining up in front of Rodgers ... plus the likelihood Douglas will use the 15th pick of the draft on a left tackle. This should be a pretty good unit, and McGovern has been one of the NFL's more underrated pivots in recent years while toiling for this club. No more.\n\nJordan Love: Like Rodgers many years before him, he heads into his fourth NFL season with a team to finally call his own. And, like Rodgers, Love showed incremental improvement during sporadic appearances over the years when he had the rare chance to get on the field. GM Brian Gutekunst sounded enthusiastic about giving the 2020 first-rounder his shot to play when discussing the possibility at the league's annual meeting in March. \"Jordan, he’s put in a lot of work. He’s gotten a lot better,\" said Gutekunst.\n\nReceivers who get to play with Rodgers: Garrett Wilson somehow won Offensive Rookie of the Year honors in 2023 (83 receptions for 1,103 yards) despite New York's severely limited attack. Now he's got arguably one of the five best passers in history throwing to him and with new wingmen Allen Lazard, a Rodgers favorite from Green Bay, and Mecole Hardman taking some pressure off him. Heck, Corey Davis might even re-establish himself as a quick-strike weapon.\n\nNew England Patriots: With the Jets and Packers swapping first-round picks, New York dropping to No. 15 and Green Bay rising to 13th, the Pats – yup, they select 14th – get one (last?) chance to stick it to the Jets on draft night by potentially stealing the guy Douglas wants in Round 1.\n\nLOSERS\n\nNew England Patriots: When was the last time every team in the AFC East had a better quarterback than the six-time Super Bowl champions? Never happened in the 21st century, that much is certain.\n\nReceivers who don't get to play with Rodgers: How will it go now in Green Bay for Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs, rookie wideouts last year who had their early struggles adapting to Rodgers? TBD, of course, though Watson had emerged as a major home run threat after settling in midway through his first season ... something that could be hard to replicate with Love and, in all likelihood, a fair amount of double coverage headed his way. And how about Elijah Moore? A 2021 second-round pick of the Jets, his attitude and inefficacy got him dealt to the Cleveland Browns last month, yet Douglas somehow managed to extract their second-rounder in a pick swap – a master stroke that seemingly aided in the consummation of the Rodgers acquisition.\n\nJoe Douglas: Good as his eye generally tends to be for acquiring talent, he whiffed badly by taking Wilson second overall in the 2021 draft – when Justin Fields was on the board – necessitating the move for Rodgers and what it costs the Jets from a financial and salary cap perspective (and his compensation moving forward is very likely to evolve given the almost $60 million bonus he's owed this year) to take on the 39-year-old and perhaps in terms of the franchise's long-term future given Douglas could be searching for a quarterback again very soon.\n\nBrian Gutekunst: Though managing Rodgers' ego clearly became too much, the Green Bay GM's ability to communicate with his locker room – and its best player – has to come under some scrutiny given the way this all went down. And with Rodgers leaving Wisconsin, sure could become a lot more challenging to lure free agents to the land of Cheeseheads, especially if Love stumbles.\n\nZach Wilson: Benched two separate times in 2022, the guy New York once hoped would end the curse of Joe Willie (Namath) might well have played his final snap for the NYJ. Wilson's teammates – Gardner, Garrett Wilson and RB Breece Hall among them – openly lobbied for Rodgers on social media in recent months, which says a lot about how they regard Zach Wilson, who has arguably been the worst starting quarterback in the league over the past two seasons. The team's brain trust doesn't have to make a determination on his future until next year, when Wilson's fifth-year rookie option will or won't be triggered. Douglas and Saleh have stated multiple times that they still believe Wilson has extraordinary talent, maintaining they view him in the Jets' long-term future. But hard to envision how he develops sitting behind Rodgers while taking on backups and practice squad players during the week.\n\nPackers in the short term: This year's edition will get to see what it has under center while moving forward with Love. However Green Bay will also pay $40 million in dead salary cap charges to not have Rodgers on the roster. So it goes. Remember, the Pack went 6-10 in 2008, Rodgers' first year at the controls.\n\nNFC: Rodgers is gone. Brady is gone. Even ... Carson Wentz is gone. But the conference seems as weak as it's maybe ever been, and it's hard to look at most of its teams – probably aside from the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers, last year's NFC title game participants – as legitimate championship contenders.\n\nMatt LaFleur: The Green Bay coach, who won 13 regular-season games and the NFC North each of his first three seasons before a descent to 8-9 in 2022, will now truly have to earn some serious sideline stripes in the post-Rodgers era.\n\nMike LaFleur: The younger brother of the Packers coach lost his offensive coordinator post with the Jets after two seasons. Might have been nice to call the plays with Rodgers under center instead of Wilson, but maybe Mike LaFleur's career gets rehabbed serving as the OC of the Rams under coaching kingmaker Sean McVay.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2023/03/08/packers-running-back-aaron-jones-tells-aaron-rodgers-good-morning-football-return-to-green-bay/69985286007/", "title": "Aaron Jones makes pitch for Aaron Rodgers to return to the Packers ...", "text": "Who will win the Aaron Rodgers sweepstakes as we apparently enter the fourth quarter of Aaron Rodgers Watch 2023?\n\nNot only is New York Jets management seriously looking to entice Rodgers to play for their franchise by reportedly having several of their brass, including owner Woody Johnson, fly out to his Malibu, California, home, but now players are doing their best to get in on the courtship of the four-time MVP.\n\nHere's some of the latest from the last two days involving Jets and Packers players.\n\nSauce Gardner says he'd burn 'cheesehead' if Aaron Rodgers is traded to the New York Jets\n\nJets cornerback Sauce Gardner, who won AFC defensive rookie of the year in 2022, tweeted at Rodgers on Tuesday.\n\n\"Aye Aaron Rodgers, I promise if you become a Jet, I won’t pick you off in practice & I’ll burn the cheesehead,” Gardner wrote.\n\nGardner, of course, famously wore a cheesehead last season at Lambeau Field after the Jets trounced the Packers, 27-10, in Week 6. The loss was the second of five straight for the Packers in a season that ended with them missing the playoffs for the first time in four years.\n\nRodgers hasn't tweeted anything in more than a month — prior to his four-day darkness retreat — so we don't even know if he'll see Gardner's tweet or the noise around him. After all, Rodgers went on the retreat to block it all out.\n\nBut Jets players aren't the only ones getting in their pitches.\n\nAaron Jones goes on 'Good Morning Football' to make his case to Aaron Rodgers to stay with the Packers\n\nAaron Jones, who also touted Jordan Love's readiness to take over the reins during Super Bowl week last month, appeared on NFL Network's \"Good Morning Football\" show Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Jones was asked what team he would want Rodgers to go to if he doesn't return to the Packers, he said he would be OK with the Jets.\n\n\"I'm salty,\" Jones said. \"I don't want him to go to Vegas so I would say he could come here (New York). But he's my quarterback. It would be good to see him reunite with (Nathaniel) Hackett (former Packers offensive coordinator and new Jets OC), somebody he knows. But like I said, Aaron Rodgers, please don't go anywhere.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Jones upped his game.\n\n\"I'm on national TV making my case,\" Jones said. \"Other guys are on social media, I'm on national TV. Come back to the Packers, we got everything we need. We're right there, we didn't start off the way we wanted to last year, but we picked it up. You're a huge part of that. Our leader. We got it going. We lost the last game to get into the playoffs. We got everything we need. Let's bring one back to Green Bay.\"\n\nAnd then in a segment where the panelists were asked to describe the New York movie they'd use to describe Rodgers becoming a Jet, Jones wrote “Do The Right Thing!”\n\n\"You know where home is,\" Jones said. \"You’ve been there for so long. You’re a leader of our team. We’d love to have you back. Just do the right thing and come home.\"\n\nJets tight end CJ Uzomah doesn't want to add to the Aaron Rodgers speculation during 'Good Morning Football' appearance\n\nJets tight end CJ Uzomah also appeared on the show via video. Jones was still there and asked him a question about the potential of young running back Breece Hall.\n\nAfter that, host Kyle Brandt tried to get Uzomah to join in on the Rodgers talk. But Uzomah wasn't taking the bait.\n\n\"Can you imagine how much room those (running backs) are going to have to run when Rodgers is throwing deep at MetLife Stadium?\" Brandt said.\n\n\"AJ’s my guy,\" Uzomah said. \"I’m going to let him have it.\"\n\nWhat has Aaron Rodgers said following his darkness retreat?\n\nWe'll see shortly if the Packers, Jets or someone else gets Rodgers for 2023.\n\nRodgers recently went on \"The Aubrey Marcus Podcast\" and said he would make a decision about his football future \"soon enough and we’ll go down that road.\"\n\nRodgers is not a free agent but has remained uncommitted about his football future and the Packers have reportedly allowed the Jets to talk to Rodgers. Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said last week \"all options are on the table\" for the 39-year-old quarterback.\n\nMore:Here's how Derek Carr signing with the Saints impacts the Packers' market for trading Aaron Rodgers\n\nMore:If Jordan Love is the Packers' next starting quarterback, his supporting cast will play a pivotal role", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2023/01/25/aaron-rodgers-news-trade-team-fits/11108382002/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers on the move? Nine logical destinations if Green Bay ...", "text": "Super Bowl 57 may still be a few weeks away. But for 28 of the NFL's 32 teams, the offseason is already well underway. And for more than a handful of them, that likely means what's become the predominant storyline throughout the league in recent springs: Targeting somebody else's starting quarterback.\n\nThis year, that could well mean acquiring the only active four-time NFL MVP. No, not Tom Brady ... actually, Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAnd, yes, the possibility seems to be growing that he could be on the move – much of it fueled by the longtime Green Bay Packers superstar himself.\n\n“People want to say, ‘Oh, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side.’ I always say the grass is green where you water it,\" Rodgers said Tuesday on “The Pat McAfee Show.\"\n\n“Change is a part of this business. It’s a part of life. I think being open to it and embracing whatever that change looks like is an important part of coming to peace with whatever decision lies ahead of you.”\n\nComing off arguably the worst of his 15 seasons as the Pack's QB1, Rodgers previously told McAfee that he thought 2022 was an aberration.\n\nJARRETT BELL:With Super Bowl mission derailed again, there are hard lessons for Buffalo Bills\n\nNATE DAVIS:How to fix the Dallas Cowboys? Seven things they must address going into 2023 NFL season\n\nDAN WOLKEN:Greedy NFL should leave AFC and NFC championship games alone\n\n“Can I play at a high level? Yeah. The highest,\" he said. \"I think I can win MVP again in the right situation. Right situation, is that Green Bay, or is that somewhere else? I’m not sure, but I don’t think you should shut down any opportunity.”\n\nMoving on from Rodgers would require the Packers to make a trade given an outright release would incur an untenable $100 million salary cap charge in 2023. A deal would reduce that figure to a more palatable $40 million – particularly since Green Bay would consequently be entering rebuild mode anyway – given whomever Rodgers plays for in 2023, be it the Packers or another team, would owe him $59.5 million.\n\nThe majority of that, $58.3 million, can be paid out as a bonus at any point prior to the start of the 2023 regular season. While that basically makes a move for Rodgers, 39, feasible, he's already shared a willingness to negotiate that number since very few teams are financially positioned to add nearly $60 million to the payroll this year.\n\n“I don’t think there’d be a scenario where I would come back and that would be the number,” Rodgers said. “Definitely things would have to shift.”\n\nBut that comment alone seems to be another clue to Rodgers' apparent willingness to shift his NFL address – assuming he continues playing at all. But he's already stated he doesn't want to be part of a rebuild and would also understand if Green Bay opts to move forward with QB Jordan Love, the team's first-round pick in 2020.\n\n“To be open to the possibility if I want to keep playing, that it might be somewhere else, I understand that,” Rodgers said. “I understand they might want to move on and go younger at a number of different positions. That’s a part of it.\"\n\nMORE:What might the Green Bay Packers get if they decide to trade Aaron Rodgers?\n\nSo where might Rodgers have a leading part if his career resumes somewhere other than Wisconsin? Here are what seem to be nine fairly realistic trade destinations ranked from least likely to most:\n\n9. San Francisco 49ers\n\nSilly, right? An already loaded team is on the cusp of reaching the Super Bowl, thanks in large part to rookie QB Brock Purdy and that seventh-round contract he has through the 2025 season. And, of course, injured Trey Lance, whom the Niners invested so heavily to obtain with the third overall pick of the 2021 draft was supposed to be the face of the franchise for the next decade. It's also important to note San Francisco has no first-round pick to offer Green Bay as it was already offloaded in the deal two years ago that allowed the 49ers to select Lance. They do currently have roughly $17 million available, per OverTheCap, but a long-term extension for probable 2022 Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa is also a leading business priority for 2023.\n\nStill, there's always been some romanticism here, real or perceived, linked to Northern California native Rodgers, who grew up rooting for the 49ers ... even though they infamously bypassed him to draft Alex Smith atop the 2005 draft. And surely whatever happens over the next Sunday – or three – will be informative given this organization didn't take long to begin searching for Jimmy Garoppolo's successor even though he was one good pass from likely securing victory in Super Bowl 54.\n\n(Also, if the Niners decide they need to pivot, they could always sign that kid from up the street – Brady – without losing draft compensation.)\n\n8. Baltimore Ravens\n\nSilly, right? Only if their avowed plans to re-sign QB Lamar Jackson somehow go sideways – perish the thought. But if a break-up with Jackson comes to pass, how does Baltimore reload? Well, the Ravens have $27 million to spend, a good offensive line, an All-Pro-caliber tight end in Mark Andrews, good running backs and an intriguing wideout in Rashod Bateman. They also have a vacant offensive coordinator position that could be filled with someone to Rodgers' liking. Probably farfetched, but this is a place where Rodgers' goals and the team's would theoretically be aligned ... assuming a playoff outfit suddenly has a gaping hole under center.\n\nFIVE CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY STORYLINES:As 49ers, Bengals, Chiefs and Eagles eye Super Bowl 57\n\n'LAMAR JACKSON IS OUR QUARTERBACK':Ravens confident they can get deal done, but QB's return no sure thing\n\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nSilly, right? They just spent a first-round pick on QB Kenny Pickett, and he made some game-winning throws late in the season. But, overall, his rookie year was decidedly average. And by the time Pickett develops into a frontline passer, assuming he does, a good chunk of an otherwise solid roster may have aged out. Even if Pickett reaches a Pro Bowl level, very good chance the Steelers would still be the weakest team in the AFC North from a quarterback perspective.\n\nRodgers' shelf life probably orients better with a defense led by veterans T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick, and his presence would only optimize offensive playmakers like RB Najee Harris, WRs Diontae Johnson and George Pickens and TE Pat Freiermuth. The O-line needs work, but the Steelers should be able to do that even if they had to surrender the 17th pick of the draft. (But they would have to restructure some contracts – the aforementioned trio of defenders being obvious candidates – to fit Rodgers into the cap.)\n\nAnd don't forget that moment in a 2021 game when Rodgers and Steelers coach Mike Tomlin shared a bit of a bromance moment when Tomlin called timeout before Rodgers could run a free play while Pittsburgh had 12 men on the field.\n\n\"I’m a big Mike Tomlin fan, I have been for a long time. I like the way that he speaks about his team and the way he goes about his business,\" Rodgers told McAfee after that game. \"I like his confidence. I’ve heard nothing but good things from guys that have played there. I like Tomlin.\"\n\n6. Atlanta Falcons\n\nFrom a fiscal point of view, they have more cap room – roughly $57 million – than any team aside from the Chicago Bears ... and Rodgers isn't getting dealt within the division to the franchise he already \"owns.\" The Falcons' trade offer could also begin with a top-10 choice, No. 8 overall specifically, this year.\n\nAtlanta additionally offers a bright offensive mind in head coach Arthur Smith and a nice array of young weapons – RB Tyler Allgeier, WR Drake London and TE Kyle Pitts. And given the state of the NFC South, especially if Brady bolts? Easily winnable, though this could concurrently be considered the kind of rebuild Rodgers isn't interested in given that, even if Atlanta might be playoff caliber in 2023, it's a stretch to think that the Falcons will suddenly be Super Bowl contenders.\n\n5. New England Patriots\n\nThey haven't won a playoff game – appearing in just one – since Brady left in 2020. Their current group of offensive playmakers isn't nearly as good as Green Bay's, and there's certainly no budding star on a par with Packers WR Christian Watson. And New England just hired sometimes prickly Bill O'Brien as its offensive coordinator, ostensibly to work with QB Mac Jones.\n\nSo what does New England offer? The 14th pick of the draft, ample cap space (about $33 million) to accommodate Rodgers and maybe some upgraded weaponry and a championship pedigree that would seemingly appeal to a player hunting a long-sought second Lombardi Trophy – one that would enable Bill Belichick to get level with Brady again. BB might even issue Rodgers Brady's No. 12 jersey.\n\n4. Seattle Seahawks\n\nYou might've heard, but they could have an opening given QB Geno Smith is unsigned. They've also got a pair of great receivers in DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett and are coming off an unexpected playoff season – catalyzed in great part by a miraculous 2022 draft that netted starting OTs Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas, RB Kenneth Walker and CBs Coby Bryant and Tariq Woolen.\n\nAnd if an ascending roster isn't enough to entice Rodgers? Well then, Seattle offers one of the few opportunities for him to play on the West Coast, the team has more than $30 million in cap space and also owns three of the upcoming draft's top 38 selections. Pretty good calculus on all sides to get a deal done ... assuming, of course, the Seahawks don't bring Smith back.\n\n3. New York Giants\n\nAnother team fresh off a surprise playoff run, the G-Men head into a compelling offseason – one in which GM Joe Schoen and HC Brian Daboll must decide what to do about QB Daniel Jones and RB Saquon Barkley, both pending free agents. The Giants currently project to have the league's third-most cap space (after Chicago and Atlanta) and could allot much of that $45 million to, say, Rodgers and Barkley? But that may not leave much to address a receiving corps where Isaiah Hodgins (351 yards) is the top performer on the roster under contract in 2023 – especially if the Giants have to surrender the 26th pick of the draft or more. WRs Sterling Shepard and Wan'Dale Robinson are options, but both are recovering from torn ACLs.\n\nPlaying in the New York media market would surely be a temptation for Rodgers, and so, too, might be working with a respected offensive coach like Daboll. And, at this point, it seems like the NFC's pathway to the Super Bowl is still more forgiving than the AFC road.\n\n2. Las Vegas Raiders\n\nThey're obviously in the market for a new quarterback, Derek Carr already sending his goodbyes to Raider Nation after being benched late in the season. He'll likely be released before Feb. 15, otherwise, Las Vegas would owe him more than $40 million in contractual guarantees. However, if the Raiders manage to trade Carr first, not only would they save the money, they'd also pick up a bit of ammo that could conceivably be repackaged as part of a deal for Rodgers – perhaps along with the seventh and/or 39th picks of the 2023 draft.\n\nLEAVING LAS VEGAS:Seven logical landing spots for Raiders QB Derek Carr\n\nBrady has also been widely connected to Sin City given his longtime relationship with coach Josh McDaniels – and, again, signing him would only cost money, not draft capital. But what's more valuable, a quarterback who will be 46 next season but knows the playbook? Or one who will be 40 and knows All-Pro and former Pack WR Davante Adams? (And placating Adams, who joined the Raiders to play with his good friend, Carr, could be a significant consideration for Vegas.)\n\nFrom Rodgers' standpoint? A reunion with Adams, plus the opportunity to throw to TE Darren Waller, slot WR Hunter Renfrow and All-Pro RB Josh Jacobs (if the Raiders can keep him) sounds pretty good. So, too, might living in Nevada, which has no state income tax and is a short flight from his Malibu home. And surely he'd embrace the challenge of playing in a division alongside fellow quarterbacking stars Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Russell Wilson (assuming he's still a star).\n\n1. New York Jets\n\nSimilar to the Giants, the NYJ offer the lure of playing in the New York market – presumably quite an attraction for Rodgers given his ample off-field interests, including media opportunities.\n\nUnlike the Giants, the Jets have a championship-caliber defense and burgeoning offensive stars like WR Garrett Wilson and RB Breece Hall. Thursday, New York hired Nathaniel Hackett as its offensive coordinator – significant given he's a favorite of Rodgers' from their time together in Green Bay, when Rodgers won his most recent MVP awards in 2020 and 2021. Heck, Hall of Famer Joe Namath has even given his blessing for Rodgers to wear his retired No. 12 jersey should he choose to don \"Gotham Green\" and \"Spotlight White.\"\n\nThe Jets would have to free up money for Rodgers – and will need more to extend All-Pro DT Quinnen Williams. But considering owner Woody Johnson's willingness to pony up for a long-awaited championship – and fact that QB Zach Wilson is the main impediment to that objective right now – this could be the best win-win scenario for Rodgers and a prospective future employer.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jets/2023/03/16/aaron-rodgers-brett-favre-packers-jets-trade-quarterback/11478273002/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers, Brett Favre parallels intensify as Jets trade awaits", "text": "The historical parallels are impossible to ignore.\n\nA Green Bay Packers franchise legend, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, a starter for 15-plus seasons is expected to move on to the New York Jets at the age of 39 – and giving way to player drafted three years prior with the intention of replacing him.\n\nAaron Rodgers revealed Wednesday on the \"Pat McAfee Show\" he intends to play for the Jets this upcoming season, essentially ending his 18-year career with the Packers, the organization that drafted him in the first round in 2005.\n\nThe move mirrors what transpired between Brett Favre and the Packers 15 years earlier – a disgruntled signal-caller headed to the Big Apple, with Green Bay turning inward for the future.\n\nMORE:The 10 most interesting things Aaron Rodgers said during wild 'Pat McAfee Show' interview\n\nAnother legend goes from Green Bay to Jets\n\nRodgers told the YouTube audience of nearly 500,000 he is \"debatably\" the best player in franchise history, along with fellow quarterbacks Bart Starr and Favre, who forced his way out in 2008 and landed with the Jets, paving the way for Rodgers to start.\n\nBoth Rodgers and Favre depart with claims as No. 1. And both head east with their final passes in green and gold having been interceptions.\n\nAs Rodgers noted at the beginning of his explanation, the front office in Green Bay is not the same as the one who drafted him – the group that also traded Favre.\n\n\"They felt like they were giving up a legend, but they felt really good about a young, emerging quarterback,\" said ESPN analyst Mike Tannenbaum, who was the Jets' general manager when Favre was acquired. \"Ironically, it was Aaron Rodgers.\"\n\nThe four-time MVP said he felt that the Packers had told people the organization was ready to move on from him and give Jordan Love, selected 26th overall in the 2020 draft, the opportunity to start.\n\nRodgers won back-to-back MVP awards in 2020 and 2021, but he and the Packers regressed this past season and missed the playoffs.\n\n\"A legend towards the end of their career,\" Tannenbaum said of both Favre and Rodgers.\n\nHow Favre's journey to New York differs from Rodgers' path\n\nAlthough Rodgers – who said he heavily considered retirement, while Favre announced his intention to do so in March 2008 before reversing course – said his mind has been made up about playing for the Jets since Friday. Since then, the quarterback carousel has continued to turn, with New York saving a seat for one special guest.\n\nThe Jets have a much bigger need at the position now than they did in 2008.\n\n\"At the time, we did have a good quarterback in Chad Pennington,\" Tannenbaum told USA TODAY Sports. \"Obviously, the Jets right now need a quarterback.\"\n\nFifteen years ago, the Jets felt like they had pieces in place and were trying to compete against the New England Patriots, a perennial powerhouse in the AFC East with their own legendary quarterback in Tom Brady – though he suffered a season-ending knee injury the year Favre was in New York. Presently, the Jets have a different divisional foe they are trying to slay in the Buffalo Bills, who have Josh Allen signed to a long-term deal.\n\nThe pitch to Favre – which took several weeks, Tannenbaum said – included multiple components.\n\n\"We have an incredible practice facility,\" Tannenbaum said. \"It’s in a really quiet part of New Jersey, with access to New York City. You win in New York, there’s nothing else like it.\"\n\nThe Favre trade materialized in August, a month before the season started. It took time for No. 4 to connect with quarterbacks coach Brian Daboll (now the head coach of the New York Giants) and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. That won't be much of an issue for Rodgers in New York, as he cited offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett as one reason why the Jets appealed to him.\n\n\"We wanted (Favre) to feel comfortable about where he was going to practice and the organization, and it took several weeks for that to happen,\" Tannenbaum said.\n\nWill Rodgers fare better than Favre in New York?\n\nFavre's Jets tenure was marred by the Jenn Sterger saga. He led the Jets to a 9-7 record, but they lost four of their final five as he tried to play through an arm injury and missed the playoffs. On Feb. 11, 2009, Favre retired. The Jets released him in April and drafted Mark Sanchez as his replacement. Favre signed with the Minnesota Vikings four months later.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rodgers pushed back on an ESPN report that he provided a list of players he would like the Jets to consider signing. But on Tuesday, the team agreed to terms on a four-year deal with former Packers receiver Allen Lazard – an example of him exerting influence, Tannenbaum said.\n\nThe trade is not yet done. But it is inevitable that Rodgers will follow in the footsteps of Favre once more.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/16"}]}

And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nCNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods.

Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood. Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWith a neighbor like the Pacific Ocean, California has “an infinite reservoir of water vapor offshore,” Swain added.\n\nCalifornia’s mountainous terrain and wildfire risk make it especially vulnerable to flooding. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/weather/hurricane-kay-forecast-california/index.html", "title": "A hurricane that just made landfall in Mexico is triggering flood ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHurricane Kay made landfall in Mexico, along the west coast of the central Baja California Peninsula on Thursday afternoon, triggering flooding concerns not just in that region, but in parts of California and Arizona too.\n\nHurricane conditions were impacting the peninsula Thursday and were expected to last several hours as the storm moved along the coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Kay had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph at the time of landfall, making it a Category 1 storm. It’s expected to weaken throughout Thursday evening, the center said, but added that tropical storm conditions will spread northward.\n\nHeavy rains will drench southern California Friday – potentially bringing several months to a year’s worth of rain to a normally arid landscape. But that’s not all: As the storm moves north, strong winds – far from providing immediate relief from California’s climate crisis-driven heat wave – actually could push already record temperatures higher in some places.\n\nFlooding is also possible starting Friday in parts of southwest Arizona, the hurricane center said.\n\nKay is expected to remain at hurricane strength until it’s around 250 miles from San Diego – something only four other storms have done since 1950, according to the National Weather Service – before weakening as it moves toward the US West Coast.\n\nBut the storm doesn’t need to be strong “for this to be a major concern for Southern California,” said Brandt Maxwell, a National Weather Service meteorologist in San Diego.\n\nKay is forecast to track parallel to the Baja California peninsula through Friday, pushing what could be record-breaking amount of moisture into Southern California and Arizona. Then just shy of the US-Mexican border, it will turn westward – away from the coast – as it makes the closest pass to Southern California for a hurricane since 1997’s Hurricane Nora.\n\nA turn to the west is expected by Saturday night, the hurricane center said.\n\nWinds could gust to more than 60 mph as the system interacts with Southern California’s mountainous terrain. And those winds will be coming from the east, which means they will have a warming effect on coastal cities; as air travels down mountains, it is compressed and its temperature rises.\n\nIt will be similar to the Santa Ana wind phenomenon, which typically occurs in the fall and winter. “We are not calling it Santa Ana winds, but they will have characteristics of them as they pass through canyons and the sloped terrain,” Maxwell told CNN.\n\nThe warm, dry winds from the east will increase the region’s already considerable fire risk. Temperatures could reach 100 degrees Friday in coastal parts of San Diego and Orange counties.\n\n“This happened in 1984 as a Category 1 Hurricane Marie well southwest of San Diego County forced temperatures to reach 100 in San Diego,” Maxwell said.\n\nLows could remain in the 80s overnight Thursday and into Friday morning, making sleeping uncomfortable, especially for those without air conditioning.\n\nThen, the relentless heat will “end abruptly and unusually” late Friday, weather service in Los Angeles said, as the tropical system’s cloud cover and rainfall move in, drastically reducing temperatures but creating new hazards: heavy rainfall and a flash flood threat.\n\nA year’s worth of rain to parts of Southern California\n\nEven as the Southwest has been mired in a multi-year megadrought, Kay’s rainfall could pose a significant flood danger.\n\n“A Moderate risk for Excessive Rainfall is in effect for portions of Southern California this weekend,” the Weather Prediction Center said Thursday evening. “While Hurricane Kay is not forecast to make landfall in California, associated rainfall will likely still impact the region, with localized regions of heavy rainfall possible.”\n\nModels suggest moisture over this normally dry area will be well above the 99th percentile for this time of year going into the weekend.\n\nEven though rainfall is desperately needed across parched Southern California, this much rain over a short period can cause creeks and rivers to rise rapidly.\n\n“It’s never a good thing to get too much rain all at once, a trait all too common among slow-moving tropical storms,” the prediction center said earlier. “Thus, the flash flood potential is summarily also rapidly increasing.”\n\nRainfall of 2 to 4 inches, possibly up to around 8 inches, is expected throughout the mountainous terrain of Southern California, especially on the eastern slopes.\n\nA warning of moderate risk of excessive rainfall – Level 3 of 4 – is in effect for Friday over portions of Southern California and far southwest Arizona, with a slight risk – Level 2 of 4 – in effect by Saturday across more of Southern California, western Arizona and far southern Nevada.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain over 36 hours Friday and Saturday at Imperial County Airport in southeastern California; the spot gets 2.38 inches of rain on average each year. If Imperial receives more than 3 inches of rain, it would make this month its wettest September, breaking a record set in 1976.\n\nThe Imperial Valley region is home to one of the nation’s most productive farm belts, especially known for producing winter vegetables for US consumers due to its year-round growing season. The area and nearby regions including Yuma, Arizona, have been dealing with long-term drought and are in contentious negotiations about reducing their hefty water supply from the Colorado River.\n\nIn Palm Springs, California, 2 to 4 inches is forecast through the weekend, pushing toward the typical annual rainfall tally of 4.61 inches. Three inches in Palm Springs would put this month in the top three wettest Septembers for the city and make it the wettest since 1976, when it got 4.17 inches; its average September rainfall is 0.24 inches.\n\nYuma could see 1.5 inches of rain through the weekend, which would make this month the wettest September there since 2009.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOctober’s full moon is just around the corner and serves as a reminder: the eerie season is fast approaching.\n\nOn Sunday, October 9, just before 5 p.m. ET, a full moon will reach its peak illumination, the US Naval Observatory’s Astronomical Applications Department said. But the moon will still be below the horizon — you’ll need to wait until sunset to fully relish the hunter’s moon and its ghostly glow.\n\nWhy the hunter’s moon? Every full moon comes with a long list of nicknames typically tied to the months of year during which it occurs, according to EarthSky. The hunter’s moon and its September predecessor, the harvest moon, however, are named for the seasons.\n\nSeptember’s full moon was closest to this year’s autumnal equinox, which fell on September 22, and thus became 2022’s harvest moon, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The full moon after the harvest moon becomes the hunter’s moon by default.\n\n(Native American tribes have different names for the full moons, such as the Arapaho tribe’s “falling leaves moon” for this month’s full moon, and the Passamaquoddy tribe’s “frost fish moon” for the full moon occurring in December.)\n\nThe hunter’s moon has historically signaled to farmers that it was time to prepare for the chilly winter ahead, as the full moon’s light provided easy visibility for hunting the animals that would fuel them through the cold months, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\n“Animals are beginning to fatten up ahead of winter, and since the farmers had recently cleaned out their fields under the harvest moon, hunters could easily see the deer and other animals that had come out to root through the remaining scraps,” the Almanac said.\n\nWhile these early farmers looked to their illuminated fields during the full moon for a successful hunt, you might be encouraged to look up. (And if you feel inclined, you can always do some meal prep.)\n\nYou’ll first be able to observe the hunter’s moon in the sky on Saturday, October 8. And as the sun sinks below the horizon on Sunday night when it’s at its peak, the moon will look bigger and more orange than usual — a result of the ‘moon illusion’ phenomenon, a trick that your brain plays on the eyes.\n\nWhen the moon is low in the sky, it is viewed in relation to things like chimneys and trees so that our eyes can make sense of its size and shape, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. “Your brain compares the size of the Moon to the trees, buildings, or other reference points, and suddenly, the Moon looks massive!”\n\nRemaining events in 2022\n\nThe hunter’s moon won’t be the weekend’s only reason to keep your eyes on the skies — the Draconid meteor shower will be best visible at around 7 p.m. ET on October 8. The meteor shower occurs “when Earth collides with bits of debris shed by periodic comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner,” NASA’s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute said. “The comet orbits the sun once every 6.6 years, leaving tendrils of dust in its wake,” NASA explained, which are visible to the naked eye.\n\nYou can also catch the peak of these upcoming meteor shower events later this year, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide:\n\n• Orionids: October 20-21\n\n• South Taurids: November 5\n\n• North Taurids: November 12\n\n• Leonids: November 17-18\n\n• Geminids: December 13-14\n\n• Ursids: December 22-23\n\nThere are two more full moons are on the calendar for 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\n• November 8: Beaver moon\n\n• December 7: Cold moon\n\nAnd there will be two more eclipses — one solar, one lunar — occurring this year.\n\nA partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to people in parts of Greenland, Iceland, most of Europe, northeast Africa, and western and central Asia.\n\nA total lunar eclipse on November 8 can be seen across Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America between 3:02 and 8:56 a.m. ET. But for people in eastern North America, the moon will be setting during that time.\n\nIt is important to wear proper eclipse glasses to view solar eclipses safely as the sun’s light can damage the eyes.", "authors": ["Danya Gainor Ashley Strickland", "Danya Gainor", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/09/24/fact-check-altered-photo-does-not-show-rare-type-lunar-eclipse/5824645001/", "title": "Fact check: Altered photo does not show a rare type of lunar eclipse", "text": "The claim: Photo shows rare astronomical event called a selenelion\n\nAnyone familiar with eclipses knows that – unlike what our ancestors believed were prophetic omens – these natural phenomena are simply when one object in space moves into the shadow of another.\n\nDuring the two types observed on Earth – solar and lunar eclipses – you don't normally see both celestial bodies simultaneously. But an image circulating on social media claims it's possible for the sun and moon to both appear together during one such eclipse.\n\n\"A very rare occurrence, the sun, and the moon are visible at the same time on the horizon. This phenomenon is known as Selenelion when the sun and moon are 180 degrees apart in the sky at the same time,\" reads a Sept. 20 Facebook post.\n\nA photo accompanying the post purportedly demonstrates this: nestled between two darkened palm trees against a twilight sky, the sun and moon are both visible, with the moon a bit higher in the sky.\n\nThe Facebook post and similar ones were shared more than a thousand times in a few days.\n\nWhile a selenelion is an actual phenomenon – a rare occurrence during a lunar eclipse – it's not depicted in this photo. The original image has been altered.\n\nFact check: Moon landing conspiracy theory misrepresents lunar footprint\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Facebook poster for comment.\n\nOriginal photo already altered by photographer\n\nThe photo's setting sun was added by its original photographer, Davide Carovana, who is based in Italy. The same photo appears on his Instagram account and was shared on April 30, 2019.\n\n\"The moon is real, I just added the sun on the bottom. All (of) the picture beside the sun is real,\" he told USA TODAY over Facebook Messenger, adding he hadn't intended to recreate an eclipse in any way.\n\nEven if the photo was meant to represent a selenelion, the sun and moon's locations are not in the right place.\n\nDuring a selenelion (also known as a \"horizontal eclipse\"), the moon and the sun can be seen at exactly opposite sides of the sky from each other. The sun appears to hover for a few extra minutes before it has actually risen and the moon before it has actually set, Space.com reported in 2014.\n\nThe Facebook post actually notes the sun and moon appear 180 degrees apart during a selenelion but fails to note this isn't happening in the picture.\n\nBut this is an optical illusion. When light travels through Earth's atmosphere and encounters obstacles, like atmospheric gases or water vapor, it tends to bounce around like a ball in an arcade pinball machine.\n\nThis bouncing or bending of light's trajectory, known as refraction, causes any astronomical object to appear to its observers as higher up in the sky than its true geometric location.\n\nFact check: Image claiming to show the Himalayas from space is digital artwork\n\nAnd seeing a selenelion is extraordinarily rare.\n\n\"It's a phenomenon that's barely possible,\" Michael Zeiler, who has charted eclipses as the curator of Eclipse-Maps.com, told NBC News in 2014. \"Besides being in the right location, you have to have the right conditions. Those right conditions require that you be at a high point, with an excellent view toward the horizon to the east and the west, and have transparent sky conditions to see both the sun and the moon.\"\n\nOur rating: Altered\n\nBased on our research, we rate ALTERED a photo that is presented as showing a rare astronomical event called a selenelion.

The announcement was made in a live news conference from Washington, D.C., and through simultaneous announcements around the world.\n\n\"We have seen what we thought was unseeable,\" said Shep Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope. \"We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole.\"\n\nThe black hole that was photographed is 55 million light-years from Earth and is located in a massive galaxy known as Messier 87, in the constellation Virgo.\n\nScientists targeted this black hole because it is one of the largest visible from Earth with a mass 6.5-billion times larger than the sun.\n\nBlack holes are objects with a gravity field so strong that light cannot escape, and astronomers believe that supermassive black holes exist at the center of almost all galaxies.\n\nScientists have long wanted to take a picture of one. But until a few years ago, they lacked a powerful enough telescope.\n\nThe black hole is so distant that viewing it is the equivalent of trying to read a newspaper in Los Angeles while sitting in New York City.\n\nThat's where the Event Horizon Telescope comes in. It's a network of eight telescopes, including two affiliated with the University of Arizona, that were combined into a single \"virtual\" telescope to observe the black hole.\n\nThe observations were made over four days in April 2017, and a team involving more than 200 researchers spent the last two years analyzing and studying the data. On Wednesday, they published a series of scientific papers and released four images that show the shadow of a black hole surrounded by a brilliant yellow border called an \"event horizon.\"\n\nThe UA played a key role in the international collaboration that involved 200 people in more than 20 countries or regions. Researchers at the UA integrated two of the eight telescopes used for the Event Horizon Telescope, one on Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona and another at the South Pole.\n\nDaniel Marrone, associate professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, helped integrate the two telescopes by installing special hardware and atomic clocks so the network of telescopes could be synced precisely. His work involved annual trips to the South Pole where he spent as many as eight weeks in the harsh environment.\n\nResearchers spent years testing the telescopes and pairing them to make sure the observations would work. Their last test was in January 2017, and by March they were ready to go.\n\nThey had to wait for good weather at several sites at once, including Hawaii, Spain, Arizona, Chile and the South Pole.\n\n\"That's a lot to ask,\" Marrone said.\n\nIn April 2017 they got lucky; the first three days of observations included some of the best weather they had ever seen, he said.\n\nThe eight telescopes, on different continents, were synced to collect radio waves from the black hole over several nights. The data collection had to be timed precisely using atomic clocks that lose only one second every 10 million years.\n\nThe observations produced an enormous amount of data that had to be stored on hard drives and then flown to Germany and Massachusetts where it was distilled to a more usable volume by supercomputers. Then scientists could analyze and reconstruct the images.\n\nJust how much data was collected?\n\nEnough to keep a playlist of high-quality mp3 files going for 5,000 years. Or put another way: A life worth of \"selfie\" pictures for 40,000 people.\n\nWednesday's announcement represented decades of work for some of the key scientists.\n\nDimitrios Psaltis, a UA professor of astronomy and physics and the Event Horizon Telescope's project scientist, began writing scientific papers 20 years ago about what it would take to photograph a black hole. The technology didn't exist then. Even five years ago, it would have been impossible.\n\n\"It's really a confluence of everything just lining up in 2017 to be able to run this project,\" Psaltis said in an interview with The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com earlier this week.\n\nAs scientists zero in on taking precision images of black holes, the work represents a new field of research in astronomy and physics.\n\nDoeleman, the director of the Event Horizon Telescope, said they expect to get even sharper pictures in the future. Two more telescopes are being added to the network, one in Greenland and another at Kitt Peak National Observatory, which is southwest of Tucson.\n\n\"As with all great discoveries, this is just the beginning,\" he said.\n\nFor those who want to learn more, the UA will hold a free lecture on the efforts required to photograph black holes at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 17.\n\nThe event features key members of the science team and takes place at the Natural Resources Building 2, Room 120, 1064 East Lowell St., Tucson.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nTonight’s sturgeon supermoon could have you dancing in the moonlight – the type that only happens three to four times per year.\n\nNamed by the Native American Algonquin tribe after sturgeon fish that were more easily caught in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water during this time of year, the sturgeon moon ends 2022’s series of four supermoons, which began in May, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. After sunset, look toward the southeast to watch this supermoon rise. It will reach peak illumination at 9:36 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\n“At certain times of the year, the moon is at its closest point to Earth and these are called supermoons,” said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society, via email. “It’s just a natural point of the moon’s orbit. At each extreme, the moon is either a little bigger or a little bit smaller (at its furthest point), but it is not a huge difference.”\n\nThis nearest proximity is called the perigee, and it is only about 226,000 miles (363,300 kilometers) from Earth, according to NASA. That’s why a supermoon also appears slightly brighter than a regular full moon. The moon’s distance from Earth changes throughout the month since its orbit isn’t a perfect circle, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nIf you take a cool photo of the supermoon, you could share it on social media with the hashtag #NASAMoonSnap – the phrase NASA is using to track moon-inspired content leading up to the late-summer launch of Artemis I, the first test flight of the rocket and spacecraft that will send future astronauts to the moon, according to NASA’s Tumblr. The agency has shared a guide for photographing the moon, and will share some users’ content on its social media platforms during the launch broadcast.\n\nThe sturgeon moon will steal the spotlight of the Perseid meteor shower peaking Thursday through Saturday.\n\n“Bright moon phases are bad for meteor showers as they wash out the dimmer meteors,” Hankey said. “A full or almost full moon dominates one part of the sky, making that part undesirable for observing meteors. The full moon also lasts the entire night, leaving no hours of complete darkness, which is preferred.”\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower lasts from July 14 to September 1, and this year’s barely visible peak will happen at 11 p.m. ET on Friday (3:00 a.m. UTC Saturday), according to EarthSky. In previous years, the Perseids have been a highly anticipated shower in the Northern Hemisphere, where it’s usually more visible. But that’s only when the moon isn’t in a phase dominating the sky.\n\nThis year, the Perseids – which strengthen in number from late evening to early dawn – were more visible in early August when the moon appeared smaller and dimmer. In previous years, they were most visible in nearly moon-free skies.\n\nThe shower’s fragments come from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun just once, according to NASA. The comet last entered the inner solar system in 1992.\n\nThe supermoon — also called the sturgeon moon — rises as a jetliner approaches John F.

He was 96.\n\nBelafonte died Tuesday at his home in New York of congestive heart failure, representative Paula Witt said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nBelafonte will be remembered as one of the most popular entertainers of the 20th century, as a singer, musician and actor. But his civil rights work in the 1960s and his anti-apartheid work in the 1980s will be just as enduring.\n\n\"I wasn't an artist who became an activist. I was an activist who became an artist,\" Belafonte wrote in his 2011 memoir. \"Ever since my mother had drummed it into me, I'd felt the need to fight injustice wherever I saw it, in whatever way I could.\"\n\nHe did that in a characteristically idiosyncratic fashion, earning admiration for his humanitarian work to relieve hunger and fight cancer, and scorn for his vocal opposition to U.S. foreign policy and his friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro. His admiration for his mentor Paul Robeson (the African American concert artist and stage and film actor famous for his civil rights activism and smeared as a communist) also raised eyebrows.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2023\n\nBelafonte was born Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. in Harlem in 1927, the biracial son of biracial parents, both of whom were born in Jamaica. It made a difference to his musical influences and his later life as a social justice activist that he grew up shuttling between New York and Kingston, Jamaica, still struggling to overcome its colonial past, he said in his 2011 book, \"My Song: A Memoir.\"\n\nBelafonte burst into the American consciousness thanks to a Jamaican folk song.\n\nHarry Belafonte song 'Day-O' ('The Banana Boat Song') brought him to fame\n\nNo one who heard it in the mid-1950s could ever forget Belafonte's warm, slightly husky voice on \"The Banana Boat Song,\" better known as \"Day-O\" for the opening lyrics of the Jamaican song he recorded in 1956 on his third record, \"Calypso.\" (Composer Irving Burgie, who co-wrote “Day-O\" and eight of the 11 songs on \"Calypso,\" died Nov. 29 at the age of 95.)\n\n\"Day-O\" was an instant hit and became Belafonte's signature song. Suddenly, America was mad for the lilting, rhythmic sound of the Caribbean islands. In virtually every live performance, Belafonte's audiences would enthusiastically join in the song's call-and-response melody and refrain.\n\nEven more impressive, \"Day-O,\" once sung by Jamaican banana workers, helped make \"Calypso\" the first album to sell more than 1 million copies. Not bad for an entertainer who started out as a club singer in New York to pay for his acting classes.\n\n\"I was good as a singer, but I wasn't the best, and I'd known that from the start,\" Belafonte wrote in \"My Song.\" \"I had to rely on my acting. And in the end, I could make a case that I was the greatest actor in the world: I'd convinced everyone I could sing.\"\n\nBelafonte's pop music-turned-folk music career was interrupted by his civil rights activism, but he was still recording as late as 2017 when he released \"When Colors Come Together,\" an anthology of some earlier recordings produced by his son David who wrote lyrics for an updated version of \"Island In The Sun,\" featuring Belafonte's grandchildren Sarafina and Amadeus and a children's choir.\n\n\"Now, let me say this about the songs of the Caribbean – almost all Black music is deeply rooted in metaphor,\" he told NPR in a 2011 interview promoting his memoir. \"The only way that we could speak to the pain and the anguish of our experiences was often through how we codified our stories in the songs that we sang.\n\n\"And when I sing the 'Banana Boat Song,' the song is a work song. It's about men who sweat all day long, and they are underpaid, and they're begging the tallyman to come and give them an honest count – counting the bananas that I've picked, so I can be paid.\" But sometimes, they were paid only in rum, as the song's lyrics describe.\n\n\"People sing and delight and dance and love it, (but) they don't really understand unless they study the song that they're singing, a work song, that's a song of rebellion,\" Belafonte said.\n\nHarry Belafonte movie career spanned decades\n\nBelafonte's TV and movie career began in 1953 and stretched into 2018 when he appeared in Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman.\" He collected his share of first awards: In 1954, he won a Tony Award as best supporting or featured actor in a musical for \"John Murray Anderson's Almanac,\" becoming the first Black man ever to receive a Tony. He was also the first Black man to receive an Emmy Award, with his first solo TV special \"Tonight with Belafonte\" in 1960.\n\nHe won three Grammys in the 1960s and won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. In 2022, he received an early influence award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was awarded a Humanitarian Oscar in 2015. He was named a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in 1987, was a recipient of one of the 1989 Kennedy Center Honors for Performing Arts, and was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994.\n\nHe even had a \"Rat Pack\" interlude in Las Vegas, performing, as did Sammy Davis Jr., at hotel casinos such as the Sands and the Dunes, which are no longer in operation.\n\nBelafonte's activism work involved marching with Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBy the 1960s, he was just as famous for being on the front lines of civil rights marches as an early ally of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. By the 1980s, he helped organize the \"We Are the World\" recording that became the anthem for famine relief in Africa.\n\nHe described how he infused his performances with his political passions, performing old favorites and changing up the lyrics to reflect his activism.\n\n\"Knowing I was playing to an influential crowd, I'd (sneak) in a little politics with new lines for old songs, like 'Michael, Row the Boat Ashore': 'Mississippi on your knees, Hallelujah!/ Another bus is on the way, Hallelujah,' \" he wrote in his memoir.\n\nHis zeal for social justice was influenced by the nonviolent tactics of India's Mahatma Gandhi, he said in a 2013 Time issue commemorating the 1963 March on Washington. \"We could start this quest for social change by confronting the state a little differently. Let's do it nonviolently, let's use passive thinking applied to aggressive ideas, and perhaps we could overthrow the oppression by making it morally unacceptable,\" he said.\n\nBelafonte helped organize the game-changing march, which brought more than 250,000 people (including scores of Hollywood stars) to the National Mall and culminated in King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech that electrified the civil rights movement.\n\n\"In the end, the day was a complete win-win,\" Belafonte recounted in the Time magazine article. \"...There was not one act of violence. And to see at the end everybody singing 'We Shall Overcome' and all the arms linked – we've said it often, but it's worth saying as often as necessary – there wasn't a dry eye in the house.\n\n\"And it was all of America. All of it. You went through that crowd and you couldn't find any type missing, any gender, any race, any religion. It was America at its most transformative moment.\"\n\nBelafonte didn't back down when it came to his politics.\n\nIn October 2002, he made remarks about then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, comparing him to a \"house slave.\" Powell, a Republican, refused to inflame the situation, merely commenting that Belafonte's comparison was \"unfortunate.\" (Powell died Oct. 18, 2021, at the age of 84.)\n\nNor did he slow down. More than a half-century after the March on Washington, Belafonte was an honorary co-chair of the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\n\nTo the end, Belafonte wanted to change America and the world.\n\n\"I've always looked at the world and thought what can I do next? Where do we go from here? How can we fix it? And that's still how I look at the world because there is so much to be done,\" he said in a documentary, \"Sing Your Song,\" that debuted at Sundance Film Festival in 2011.\n\n\"The whole world is caught in human suffering. And those who professed about making change have not come up with answers. We have failed in terms of the moral side. We have to do more.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/entertainment/howard-hesseman-wkrp-cincinnati-dies/index.html&quot;", "title": "Howard Hesseman, the hard rocking DJ on 'WKRP in Cincinnati ...", "text": "(CNN) Actor Howard Hesseman, best known as the hard-rocking disc jockey Dr. Johnny Fever on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" has died, according to his manager, Robbie Kass.\n\nHesseman died Saturday afternoon from complications related to colon surgery, Kass told CNN.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/04/25/joe-biden-age-oldest-us-presidents/11733325002/", "title": "Joe Biden age: See how old he'll be if re-elected as president in 2024", "text": "President Joe Biden announced his candidacy for re-election on Tuesday, which if successful would make him the oldest elected president in U.S. history.\n\nIf Biden wins the 2024 election as the Democratic candidate and serves out his entire term, he would be 86 years old at the end of his presidency in January 2029.\n\nTo be sure, there’s little to suggest that Biden, who turned 80 in November, has been limited by his age, but it’s interesting to note that he’s already outlived 33 of 45 of the country's former presidents.\n\nHere's a look Biden’s longevity as a member of the White House – from two terms as a vice president to his current presidency.\n\nHow Biden’s age compares to presidents since Jimmy Carter\n\nTrump would be second-oldest president\n\nIt should be noted that Biden took the moniker of “oldest serving president” from former president Donald Trump, who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nShould Trump win the 2024 election, he would be the second-oldest president in the nation's history.\n\nTwo-term president Ronald Reagan had held the title of oldest-serving president for about three decades before Trump.\n\nFor months, Biden has said that he intends to run for a second term.

And number two, I did put her in charge. I think she’s doing a good job.”\n\nBiden’s remarks Wednesday come after Harris dismissed a question about whether she’d be on the ticket in 2024 in an interview with NBC last week, following an op-ed that floated Biden picking Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming to replace Harris.\n\n“I’m sorry, we are thinking about today. I mean honestly I know why you’re asking the question. … We’re focused on the things in front of us,” she said.\n\nStill, questions persist about whether Biden actually plans to run again in 2024. And missteps by Harris – whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues – have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nHarris has said on multiple occasions that she and Biden haven’t talked about whether the 79-year-old will run for reelection in 2024.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News in December, Biden once again says he intends to run for reelection in 2024, though he left a little wiggle room in his answer.\n\n“Yes. But look, I’m a great respecter of fate – fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I’m in the health I’m in now – I’m in good health – then in fact I would run again,” Biden said.\n\nPressed by ABC’s David Muir if he’d be up for a rematch against former President Donald Trump, Biden joked, “You’re trying to tempt me now.”\n\n“Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump? He’s the nominee, that increases the prospect of running,” Biden added.\n\nThe President has been adamant that he will run for reelection in 2024, despite the fact that he will be 81 years old on Election Day. Biden is already the oldest person in US history to be inaugurated as president, but has been deemed to be in good health and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” according to his White House doctor, Dr. Kevin O’Connor.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/biden-2024-intention-reelection/index.html", "title": "Biden says it's his 'intention' to run again in 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so.\n\n“The reason I’m not making a judgment about formally running or not running, once I make that judgment, a whole series of regulations kick in and I have to be – I treat myself as a candidate from that moment on. I have not made that formal decision, but it’s my intention – my intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision,” Biden told MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart in an interview at Delaware State University in Dover.\n\nThe question of Biden’s political future will be front-and-center for Democrats after November’s midterm elections, in which the party is fighting to keep control of Congress. Already, the President’s responses to whether he will mount another bid for the White House have injected questions into the developing 2024 race.\n\nLast month, Biden said it was “much too early” to make the decision on whether he would run again for president in 2024, opening the door to potentially not seeking another term.\n\nAt 79, Biden is already the oldest president in American history and, as CNN previously reported, his public schedule has before led to questions about how extensive a campaign he’d engage in if he runs.\n\nOn Friday, the President said that first lady Dr. Jill Biden thinks that the work they are doing is “very important.”\n\n“Dr. Biden thinks that – my wife – thinks that I – that we’re – that we’re doing something very important, and that I shouldn’t walk away from it,” Biden said.\n\nAsked what his late son Beau Biden would say to people who think the President is too old to run, Biden said: “It’s not so much [what] he’d say to those people. What he’d say to me in my view. The only reason to be involved in public life is can you make life better for other people. And depending on who the opponent is, if they have a view that is such the antithesis of what I believe democracy and I believe is good for average Americans, then his argument was, Dad, you have an obligation to do something.”\n\nIn the wide ranging interview, Biden also vowed to use his veto power to protect reproductive rights if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterms and pass laws to outlaw abortion nationwide.\n\nAsked how he would “protect women,” Biden said he would “veto anything” that Republicans put forward to restrict access to the procedure.\n\n“For them to outlaw Roe, outlaw the right of a woman to make a choice with their doctor, to not make exceptions for rape, and incest, and et cetera, and pass it out of the Congress to make it the law of the land, the president has to sign it. I’ll veto it,” Biden said of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to abortion until the Supreme Court overturned the ruling in June.\n\nThis comes after the President sought to mobilize voters in his party this week by promising to sign a law to codify abortion rights in January if voters elect more Democrats in order to ensure such legislation could pass.\n\nThe President’s vow echoed remarks from earlier in the week when he said of the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress passing a bill banning abortions nationwide: “If such a bill would pass in the next several years, I’ll veto it.”\n\nOn the economy and inflation, the President brushed off polls showing the majority of voters disapprove of the direction of the economy, saying that “a lot of what we’ve done and we’ve passed has not kicked in yet.”\n\nHe argued the GOP does not have a plan to address Americans’ economic concerns, saying: “They don’t have a platform other than to tear down what I’ve been able to do, we’ve been able to do. And I don’t know what they’re for.”\n\nBiden also doubled down on his criticisms of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s recent comments calling into question the future of US aid to Ukraine.\n\n“I can understand somebody having that view who is uninformed, and believe it, because it costs so much money to help them,” Biden said Friday. “But there’s so much more than Ukrainians. It’s about NATO, about Western Europe. It’s about making sure that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is not able to succeed in a way that he is using the brutality of his activities.”", "authors": ["Sam Fossum Sonnet Swire", "Sam Fossum", "Sonnet Swire"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/joe-biden-age-presidency-what-matters/index.html", "title": "People are talking about Biden's age again | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nJoe Biden knows what it’s like to be the youngest guy in the room – he was sworn in as a senator at 30, the minimum age allowed by the Constitution.\n\nWe all now know what it’s like for Biden to be the oldest president in history – if he stands for reelection in 2024 and wins, he’ll be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nThe people who wrote the Constitution adopted an age minimum for presidents – 35 – but they set no maximum, perhaps not realizing that hundreds of years later, people would be living much longer lives.\n\nA defense against dynasties\n\nOne reason the framers agreed on a minimum age for presidents was to avoid American political dynasties, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nJames Monroe, the future President who opposed ratification of the Constitution, said that 35 was a good minimum age because, “in the course of nature very few fathers leave a son who has arrived to that age.”\n\nTimes have changed. Biden is an outlier in the US for being a President who has lost two children, but he has a son who is 52 and a daughter who is 41.\n\n25, 30, 35\n\nThere is an arbitrary feeling to the age minimums set by the Constitution. Starting with the minimum age of 25 set for members of the House, the framers added five years for senators and five more for president.\n\nThey set no age requirements or other specific qualifications for Supreme Court justices, including length of service, which is why the new conservative majority could be ensconced for generations.\n\nThe argument to step aside\n\nWhile the Constitution allows for old presidents, political pundits are increasingly loud about questioning the wisdom of a Biden run for reelection.\n\nThe Atlantic writer Mark Leibovich wrote a plea in June titled, “Why Biden Shouldn’t Run in 2024,” for the President to bow out after one term. His argument was that the President is too old, although Leibovich was ashamed to admit it.\n\n“It all feels impolite to point this out—disrespectful, ageist, and taboo, especially given the gross Republican smears about Biden being a doddering and demented old puppet,” Leibovich wrote. “No one wants to perpetuate this garbage.”\n\nThis weekend, The New York Times writer Peter Baker took a more analytical look at Biden’s age, reporting how the President spends most weekends at home in Delaware and calibrates his schedule to avoid especially long foreign trips and to tamp down on evening appearances.\n\nMany presidents live very long lives\n\nBiden doesn’t turn 80 until November and could well have decades of life ahead of him.\n\nNo US president has lived to 100, but recent presidents have all lived very long lives.\n\nJimmy Carter is the longest-living former President, a 97-year-old cancer survivor. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford all lived into their 90s. But all these men enjoyed long retirements: 15 years for Reagan, 25 for Bush, nearly 30 for Ford, and 41 and counting for Carter.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before\n\nThe oldest presidents often face questions about their fitness, typically in the form of whisper campaigns from their political rivals.\n\nDonald Trump, who was in his 70s as President, frequently saw his temperament questioned. Reagan ultimately developed Alzheimer’s disease, but allegations that he showed symptoms in his final years in office have never been proven.\n\nRELATED: Reagan didn’t have Alzheimer’s while in office\n\nRunning into their 80s\n\nBiden’s old Senate colleagues routinely run for reelection in their 80s.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley of Iowa is running for reelection, and he turns 89 in September.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who is the subject of ageist questions about her fitness, recently turned 89, and her term lasts until the 2024 election.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on the other hand, decided last year when he was 81 not to run for reelection.\n\nOther senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina seem downright young for planning to retire from the Senate while in their 60s.\n\nDecades at the top\n\nNancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, all in their 80s, have been top Democrats in the House since 2002.\n\nIf Democrats lose control of the House after November’s midterm elections, it would be an obvious moment for the party to begin looking to a new generation of leaders.\n\nThe facts vs. the smears\n\nWhen The Atlantic column urging Biden not to seek reelection was published in June, CNN’s John Harwood tried to separate the valid questions about aging from the false and politically damaging idea that Biden is not cogent and capable.\n\n“What’s true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally and physically, and Joe Biden is old,” Harwood said on “Reliable Sources.” He added: “He doesn’t talk or walk as smoothly as he once did.”\n\nWhat is not true is the trope pushed in conservative media that Biden is not currently mentally capable of doing the job. The President is engaged and acute, Harwood said.\n\nMajorities have concerns\n\nWhen I asked CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy for recent examples of public opinion on Biden’s age, she provided multiple examples of majorities of Americans thinking Biden’s advanced age is an issue:\n\nIn a November 2021 Fox poll , 53% of registered voters said that Biden’s age was interfering with his ability to serve effectively as President, and 40% said it was not.\n\nIn a February 2022 ABC News/Washington Post poll , 40% of US adults said they thought Biden “has the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president,” while 54% said he did not.\n\nDiscomfort with Biden’s age extends to Democrats as they look to the next presidential election:\n\nNew York Times/Siena College poll released on Monday finds that 64% of voters who intend to vote in the 2024 Democratic primary would prefer a nominee other than Biden. Among the group who would prefer a different nominee, 33% say that their reason for wanting someone different is mostly to do with Biden’s age, with another 3% citing his mental acuity.\n\nBeating back age questions in 2020\n\nBiden overcame many younger Democratic candidates to win the nomination in 2020, when the top priority for many voters was simply to defeat Trump. Voters will have other things on their minds in 2024, particularly if Trump is not a candidate or does not win the GOP nomination.\n\nEdwards-Levy also argued that people’s attitude toward politicians’ ages can often be at least partially a reflection of how they feel about that candidate more generally.\n\nIn other words, Biden’s age is a problem so long as Biden is not popular.\n\nOr, as Harwood said last month, “Joe Biden would look a little bit younger if he was at 50% (approval) than at 40%, but he’s not – and so he’s going to have to deal with these stories for some time.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Theodore Roosevelt’s progressive rebellion split open a schism in the GOP; neither Herbert Hoover nor Martin Van Buren could get nominations from their parties after previous losses.\n\nWith the announcement of his third White House run, Trump is trying to emulate Cleveland, who won, lost and then won the White House in 1884, 1888 and 1892.\n\nIn many other ways, Trump, a native New Yorker, and Cleveland, the only president born in New Jersey, have little in common. Most of what’s below comes from reading about Cleveland at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and also the University of California Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project.\n\nTrump, a Republican, lost the popular vote twice. He lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to Joe Biden in 2020, but Trump also got fewer popular votes compared with Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady, when he beat her in the Electoral College in 2016.\n\nCleveland, a Democrat, won the popular vote three times. He got more popular votes than his opponent when he won the White House in 1884 and 1892, and while he lost the Electoral College vote to Benjamin Harrison in 1888, Cleveland beat him in the popular vote. Regardless of the popular vote, Cleveland’s first win in 1884 was thanks to an extremely narrow 1,200-vote margin that delivered him New York’s decisive electoral votes.\n\nTrump rejected his loss. The former president skipped Biden’s inauguration, still won’t admit he lost in 2020 and has infected the Republican Party with a vein of denialism.\n\nCleveland held the umbrella as his opponent became president. At a rainy inauguration in March 1889, Cleveland held an umbrella over Harrison’s head as the latter took the oath of office.\n\nCleveland holds an umbrella over Harrison as he takes the oath of office. Library of Congress\n\nTrump is one of the oldest presidents. Seventy when he took office in 2017, Trump would be 78 if he wins and takes office again in January 2025. That would make him the second-oldest president after Biden.\n\nCleveland was a young president. Just 47 when he first took the oath of office, Cleveland was 55 when he won reelection. Cleveland died at 71, an age at which Trump was in the first half of his term.\n\nTrump revels in the campaign. He lives for winding speeches eaten up by adoring crowds.\n\nCleveland barely campaigned. Candidates of the day didn’t campaign as much, but when he first won the White House in 1884, Cleveland gave just two campaign speeches.\n\nHe was similarly disinterested in campaigning four years later, which could explain his defeat in 1888, but doesn’t explain how he won again in 1892.\n\nTrump is famous for denying scandals. One example: He disputed paying hush money to women who alleged affairs with him despite the confirmation of his former attorney Michael Cohen, who set up the payments.\n\nCleveland admitted an affair. Attacked by Republicans in 1884, Cleveland admitted he may in fact have fathered an illegitimate child with a woman later sent to an insane asylum.\n\n“Ma, Ma, Where’s my Pa,” went the attack ad of the day. Cleveland turned honesty into a campaign attribute and urged supporters to tell the truth.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs. One of Trump’s lasting policy legacies are the tariffs he imposed on China and other countries.\n\nCleveland fought tariffs. A reason he lost in 1892 was Cleveland’s opposition to high tariffs, an unpopular position exploited by Harrison.\n\nThere are, however, some other similarities between Trump and Cleveland.\n\nCleveland and Frances Folsom's wedding in June of 1886 was the only marriage of a sitting president in the White House. She was 21 and had been his ward. Getty Images\n\nThey both married younger women. Melania Trump is 24 years younger than her husband, Donald. Cleveland married his wife Frances during his first term in the White House, still the only marriage of a sitting president conducted at the White House. Frances Cleveland was 21 at the time and had been Cleveland’s ward after her father, Cleveland’s former law partner, died.\n\nThey both considered using troops on Americans. Trump considered calling out the military on protesters in front of the White House, and some of his advisers considered trying to impose martial law as they sought to overturn his defeat in 2020.\n\nCleveland called out federal troops to put down the Pullman railcar strike, a controversial and unprecedented use of force against striking workers.\n\n(Related: Today, the odds of a railroad union strike are on the rise after a third union rejected a proposed contract. Read more.)\n\nThey both promised to clean up Washington. Trump won in 2016 promising to “drain the swamp” in Washington, and Cleveland’s main issue was to put corrupt Republicans in check, something that resonated with anti-corruption Republicans known as the “Mugwumps.”\n\nThey both cut down on some immigration. The issue that most animated Trump was building a wall at the southern border. He also curbed legal immigration to the US and imposed a travel ban on certain countries. Cleveland renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act and prevented Chinese laborers from returning to the US. But Cleveland rejected a law that would have imposed a literacy test on immigrants.\n\nThey both relied on the South. Trump could not win his home state of New York like Cleveland did, but both men relied on a southern base of support for their political power.\n\nJoshua Zeitz wrote for Politico recently that when Cleveland ran in 1892 after losing in 1888, it was largely out of boredom. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be more interested in revenge for what he falsely calls a fraudulent election.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Martin Van Buren’s political party.

That piece included these brutal lines:\n\n“His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.”\n\n2) A New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday showed that 64% of voters planning to participate in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary said they want the party to nominate a candidate other than Biden. Among the youngest voters (ages 18-29) in that group, a critical part of the party’s coalition, just 5% – not a typo – want the party to renominate Biden.\n\n3) Asked for a reason for why they would prefer someone other than Biden, 33% of Democratic primary voters cited his age, while 32% said his job performance. Among Biden’s rough age cohort – those 65 and over – 60% said age was the main reason they wanted Democrats to nominate someone other than the President.\n\nThose are striking numbers that speak to the fact that this isn’t just a summer story being driven by the media. It’s a legitimate concern for voters – even those who are favorably inclined to the party to which Biden belongs.\n\nLet’s consider some facts.\n\n* Joe Biden is 79 years old. He was the oldest person ever elected president – by five years – when he won the White House in 2020 at age 77. (He turned 78 less than a month after the election.)\n\n* If/when he runs for reelection in 2024, he will be 81 years old on Election Day – and will turn 82 shortly after. (Biden’s birthday is November 20, 1942.)\n\n* White House physician Kevin O’Connor said following an examination of Biden in November 2021 that the President “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. O’Connor also noted that “the President’s ambulatory gait is perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago.”\n\nBiden himself, during the course of the 2020 campaign, acknowledged that voters should consider his age as they made up their minds about their vote.\n\n“I think it’s totally appropriate for people to look at my age,” he said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire in 2019. “Just like when I was 29 [when he was elected to the Senate], was I old enough? And now, am I fit enough? I’ll completely disclose everything about my health. I’m in good shape.”\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Biden was even more blunt about his age as an issue. “I say if they’re concerned, don’t vote for me,” he said.\n\nAt least one of his primary opponents – Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan – made an overt appeal on Biden’s age. “I just think Biden is declining,” Ryan said in September 2019, according to Bloomberg News. “I don’t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily. And I love the guy.” Later, in an interview with CNN, Ryan said: “It’s not like I said something that a lot of people aren’t thinking.”\n\nThe question of how big of an issue Biden’s age will wind up being for voters if he runs in 2024 remains to be seen – and could be dependent on whether Republicans nominate someone who can drive that contrast with Biden or not.\n\nAt present, the leading Republican presidential contenders is Donald Trump, who, at 76, is no spring chicken. In a post on his Truth Social app on Sunday, Trump characteristically tried to have it both ways on the age question.\n\n“President Biden is one of the oldest 79s in History but, by and of itself, he is not an old man,” Trump wrote. “There are many people in their 80s, and even 90s that are as good and sharp as ever. Biden is not one of them, but it has little to do with his age. In actuality, life begins at 80!”", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/politics/american-politicians-old/index.html", "title": "One thing Americans agree on? Our politicians are too old. | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe President of the United States is 79 years old.\n\nThe speaker of the House is 82 years old.\n\nThe Senate majority leader is 71 years old.\n\nThe average age of a US senator at the start of 2021 was 64.3 – the oldest in American history.\n\nWhile the American public doesn’t agree on much, they do agree on this: Our politicians are simply too old.\n\nA new CBS News poll shows that almost three in four Americans (73%) think there should be some sort of maximum age limit placed on elected officials. Support for such an age limit is consistent across party lines. Seven in ten Democrats (71%) are on board, as are three quarters of Republicans and independents. Support is also remarkably consistent among age groups. Interestingly, the youngest group in the survey – those ages 18-29 – are least in favor of maximum age limits (68%), while three quarters of all other age cohorts back them.\n\nWhat should the age cutoff be to serve in office? The most common answer among the choices presented in the CBS poll was 70 years old, with 4 in 10 Americans picking that option. One in 4 (26%) said 60 should be the oldest someone can be to hold elected office, while 18% said 80 should be the limit.\n\nThis is not, of course, some pie-in-the-sky discussion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, as I noted above, is 79 years old. He will turn 82 shortly after the 2024 election. He is already the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president.\n\nThat has led to skepticism, including from members of his own party, that he should seek a second term.\n\n“My hunch is that we need new leadership across the board – Democrats, Republicans, I think it’s time for a generational move,’ Ohio Democratic Senate nominee Tim Ryan said recently when asked if Biden should run for reelection.\n\nA slew of polling conducted over the summer showed that large swaths of the country also raised doubts about Biden running for another term, with some survey respondents citing his age.\n\n“The presidency is too hard, physically, on anybody that’s there,” Jean Davis, an 87-year-old Iowa resident told the Des Moines Register in July of Biden. “He might have it mentally. But, physically, I don’t think he’s capable.”\n\n“I’m just going to come out and say it: I want younger blood,” Nicole Farrier, a 38-year-old Michigan resident, told The New York Times in July. “I am so tired of all old people running our country. I don’t want someone knocking on death’s door.”\n\nAs the Times put it in a separate story:\n\n“Mr. Biden looks older than just a few years ago, a political liability that cannot be solved by traditional White House stratagems like staff shake-ups or new communications plans. His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump sought to make Biden’s age and mental acuity an issue during the 2020 campaign – and has continued to do so since losing that race. “This guy doesn’t have a clue,” Trump said ahead of their first 2020 debate. “He doesn’t know where the hell he is. This guy doesn’t know he’s alive.” Trump, it’s worth noting, is no spring chicken at 76 years old as he eyes another potential White House bid.\n\nBiden has hit forcefully back against those sorts of attacks. “Watch me, Mr. President. Watch me,” Biden said in August 2020. “Look at us both. Look at us both, what we say, what we do, what we control, what we know, what kind of shape we’re in. Come on.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, following Biden’s annual physical last fall, his physician said the President “remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nEven below the presidential level, the question of age has come to the fore in recent months. Last spring, the San Francisco Chronicle published a lengthy piece detailing the alleged mental decline of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 89 years old. The article included these lines:\n\n“Four U.S. senators, including three Democrats, as well as three former Feinstein staffers and the California Democratic member of Congress told The Chronicle in recent interviews that her memory is rapidly deteriorating. They said it appears she can no longer fulfill her job duties without her staff doing much of the work required to represent the nearly 40 million people of California.”\n\nFeinstein subsequently told the Chronicle’s editorial board that she was “puzzled” by the reporting, noting: “I meet regularly with leaders. I’m not isolated. I see people. My attendance is good. I put in the hours.”\n\n(Sidebar: Feinstein had previously stepped down from her spot as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 following liberal criticism of her handling of Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination hearings.)\n\nFeinstein’s current term ends in 2025.\n\nThe age issue – whether at the presidential, Senate or House level – is a touchy one to report on or even to talk about. Age is undefeated, and everyone knows that at some point it could be them who is being quietly ushered off the public stage.\n\nAt the same time, as these CBS poll numbers make clear, the public is fed up with so many old politicians – and is more than ready for a change.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/16/biden-medical-physical-2024-re-election-bid/11172774002/", "title": "Biden physical results: Does president's exam provide clues for 2024?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden remains a \"healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,\" the White House physician said Thursday after the president received his first physical exam in a year and a half.\n\nOne small lesion, however, was removed from the president's chest during the examination and will be sent for a traditional biopsy, Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, said in a letter that otherwise mostly reflected his last medical checkup from November 2021.\n\nBiden's routine physical has taken on extra scrutiny as the octogenarian is widely expected to announce a reelection bid in the coming weeks or months. Already the oldest person to assume the presidency, Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nIn search of the perfect president:What Americans say they want, from age to gender\n\nResults of the biopsy are pending. O'Connor observed that Biden's gait remains stiff but has not worsened since his physical in 2021, attributing the stiffness to spinal arthritis, a previously broken foot and mild neuropathy in his feet.\n\nNeurological exam shows no brain disorders, motor weakness\n\nBiden underwent an “extremely detailed” neurological exam that O’Connor said uncovered no findings consistent with a brain or central neurological disorder, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nThe exam did show a “mild peripheral neuropathy” in both feet, O’Connor said. Biden did not demonstrate any motor weakness, the physician said, but showed a subtle difference in heat/cold sensation. O’Connor stressed that Biden’s symptoms haven’t progressed and have actually improved since his last exam.\n\nBiden, who had a COVID-19 infection in July, followed by a rebound case, has not experienced any residual symptoms associated with \"Long COVID,\" O'Connor said.\n\nBiden weighs 178 pounds and had a blood pressure rate of of 128/76 and pulse rate of 69, the physician’s report said. That's six pounds less than the 184 pounds he weighed in 2021.\n\nBiden experiences occasional bouts of gastroesophageal reflux, which causes him to clear his throat often and may contribute to occasional cough and sinus congestion, the report said. The symptoms are typically exacerbated shortly after meals. The physician said he will continue to take the acid blocker Pepcid.\n\nWhile Biden acknowledges that questions about his age are legitimate, he has also insisted he’s capable of serving four more years.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Biden has said more than once, including in an interview last week.\n\n\"I would be completely, thoroughly honest with the American people if I thought there was any health problem, anything that would keep me from being able to do the job,\" Biden told PBS NewsHour. \"And, so we'll see. But, you know, I just — I think people have to just watch me.\"\n\nWhite House dismisses concerns about Biden's age\n\nRepublicans have already gone after his age.\n\nDelivering the GOP response to Biden’s State of the Union address last week, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted she’s the nation’s youngest governor while Biden is “the oldest president in American history.”\n\nNikki Haley, who entered the Republican presidential race this week, is calling for \"mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.\"\n\n\"When people send someone to Washington, they need to know they’re at the top of their game,\" Haley told Fox News Thursday.\n\nHaley is pushing for a new generation of leaders, an argument that works against both Biden and former President Donald Trump, 76.\n\nAsked about Haley's comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed to what Biden has accomplished as president, including defying expectations in the midterm elections.\n\n\"It is surprising that we get this question when you look at the record of this president,\" she said. \"He’s clearly capable in so many ways and on so many levels. And he’s going to continue to do that in the years coming.”\n\nStill, half of registered voters think later middle age, between 51 and 65 years old, is the ideal age for a president, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll taken at the end of last year.\n\nAn additional 25% picked earlier middle age, 35 to 50 years old. Less than 1 percent said their ideal president would be 80 or older.\n\nJean-Pierre said scheduling difficulties prevented Thursday's physical from happening sooner.\n\n'Happy birthday, Mr. President':Biden turns 80 amid questions about a reelection bid\n\nRelated:Republican Nikki Haley calls for 'a new generation' - preferably her - in her first 2024 campaign rally\n\nMore:Joe Biden boxes Republicans into a corner on Social Security, Medicare with an eye on 2024", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/16"}]}

The Great Replacement Theory\n\n7 in 10 Republicans believe conspiracy:Great Replacement\n\nExplainer:What Replacement Theory is, and what it's not\n\nCarlson has long pushed the racist and antisemitic theory of a “great replacement” happening in America. This debunked theory posits that white people are being systematically “replaced” by immigrants of color not by natural demographic changes but in a deliberate scheme orchestrated by an elitist liberal cabal.\n\nThe Great Replacement Theory aims to inject fear into white, conservative voters that they are being “replaced” by immigrants of color, who, as the theory goes, are more likely to vote for the liberal policies favored by the shadowy group working to bring them into the country.\n\nLast year, The New York Times reported that Carlson pushed this theory on more than 400 episodes of his show. Last May, the Anti-Defamation League called for Carlson to be removed for his promotion of the Great Replacement theory.\n\n2. The idea of a ‘white genocide’ in South Africa\n\nIn August 2018, then-President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate “the large scale killing of farmers” in South Africa. The tweet directly followed one of several television segments Carlson devoted to the claim that white South African farmers were being killed in huge numbers.\n\nThat story had been formed and spread on 4Chan and other spaces online, where posters spread the lie of a “white genocide” in South Africa as justification for their hatred of Black people. Those same forums erupted with joy when Carlson, then Trump, repeated their baseless ruse.\n\nThere was, and is, no truth to this rumor, but that didn’t stop Trump and Carlson spreading it to their tens of millions of followers.\n\nHeidi Beirich, who then led the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project on hate and extremism, said of the Fox News host at the time: “Tucker Carlson has become our hate mainstreamer-in-chief.”\n\n3. Blaming American problems on immigrants\n\nIn December 2018, Carlson said on the air that immigration makes America “poorer, and dirtier and more divided.”\n\nThe comments, on which Carlson later doubled down, led to an exodus of advertisers from his show.\n\n4. Misrepresenting the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nHate speech spikes:Tucker Carlson doubles down on voter 'replacement' comments after ADL calls for his firing\n\nEarlier this year, Carlson aired a segment featuring previously unseen video footage from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (In a sign of Carlson's influence among conservatives, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had given him \"exclusive\" access to a trove of security video.)\n\nBy picking a few snippets of video, Carlson told his viewers that the insurrection was not the deadly, violent uprising it was. Instead, he portrayed Jan. 6 as a largely peaceful gathering of law-abiding patriots, recasting the Washington mob that breached the Capitol as an “orderly and meek” gathering of “sightseers.” His comments were contradicted by the U.S. Capitol Police chief, who called the segment “offensive and misleading.”\n\nA dangerous new wave of social media chatter followed, including death threats against Capitol police officers and Democratic leaders, according to experts who monitor extremism and a report from Advance Democracy.\n\n5. Pushing the idea of an Antifa bogeyman\n\nAntifa case heads to trial:As crucial legal test for Antifa ideology heads to trial, right-wing media also scrutinized\n\nDig deeper: San Diego case will be a crucial test\n\nCarlson has led the way among many conservative pundits pushing the idea that anti-fascist activists are part of a highly organized army called “Antifa.” This idea seeks to lump any leftist organizers and activists together as evil anarchists bent on destroying America.\n\nThat claim has even been taken up by prosecutors, including in one landmark case in San Diego.\n\nCarlson’s reports on Antifa – earlier this year he called Antifa the ”armed militia of the Democratic Party” – have been instrumental in the battle to convince millions of Americans that any young person who dresses in black and protests against anything from police brutality to environmental damage is part of this group.\n\nCarlson, like others, regularly places the responsibility for any property damage caused during protests or riots on the shoulders of “Antifa,” even when violence occurs at clashes between far-left and far-right protestors like members of the Proud Boys.\n\nCatch up:The week in extremism, from USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/04/26/tucker-carlson-breaks-silence-after-fox-news-firing/11748604002/", "title": "Tucker Carlson breaks silence after Fox News firing on Twitter", "text": "Tucker Carlson is breaking his silence following Fox News' announcement that he and the network are parting ways.\n\nWithout mentioning his Fox departure directly, the right-wing television personality took to Twitter Wednesday to share a video statement.\n\n\"One of the first things you realize, when you step outside the noise for a few days, is how many genuinely nice people there are in this country and decent people who really care about what's true,\" Carlson said, adding that \"the other thing you notice when you take a little time off is how unbelievably stupid most of the debates you see on television are.\"\n\n\"They're completely irrelevant,\" he continued. \"They mean nothing. In five years we won't even remember that we had them. Trust me, as someone who's participated.”\n\nCarlson then alleged that the major political parties in the United States and their donors collude to shut down discussion on \"undeniably big topics\" that \"will define our future,\" such as war, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power and natural resources.\n\nJimmy Kimmel on Tucker Carlson leaving Fox News: 'What an absolutely delightful shock'\n\n\"This moment is too inherently ridiculous to continue, so it won't,\" he said. \"When honest people say what's true calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful.

See you soon.”\n\nEverything to know about top-rated Fox News host Tucker Carlson's exit: A seismic cable shift\n\nCarlson's last hosting duty for his prime-time conservative opinion show \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" was Friday, Fox said. An interim show, consisting of rotating Fox News personalities, will fill the 8 ET time slot until a new host is named.\n\n\"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,\" Fox said.\n\nCarlson, 53, did not telegraph the news on Friday's show, and Fox never gave him the opportunity to address his viewers. Instead, he signed off from what turned out to be his final show with, \"We'll be back on Monday; in the meantime have the best weekend.\"\n\nCarlson became Fox’s most popular personality after replacing Bill O’Reilly, who was fired in 2016 after settling a sexual harassment investigation.\n\nNetwork spokespersons didn't respond to a request to elaborate on the reasons for his departure, but it quickly followed last week's $787.5 million payment Fox agreed to make to settle a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion's suit accused Fox News of recklessly airing false election claims and conspiracy theories following the 2020 presidential election, with Carlson's revealed text messages front and center in the case.\n\nTucker Carlson leaves Fox News in wake of Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/05/10/tucker-carlson-and-twitter-are-a-twisted-match-made-heaven-opinion/70203085007/", "title": "Tucker Carlson and Twitter are a twisted match made heaven ...", "text": "Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk are a match made just a few feet below heaven.\n\nIn its own twisted way, it’s perfect.\n\nCarlson took to Twitter Tuesday to threaten, er, announce in a video that he will be bringing a new version of his Fox News primetime show to the platform, now owned by noted troll Musk. Carlson will announce more details later, he said, but “for now we’re just grateful to be here.”\n\nHe’s grateful to be anywhere, probably. Carlson parted ways with Fox News in April in what was by all accounts not an amicable divorce. His exit came the week after Fox News settled a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million.\n\nTucker Carlson can't be trusted\n\nIn the meantime Carlson was revealed to have texted a racist and bizarre comment to a former producer after the Jan. 6 insurrection. Previously reported texts found him lying to his audience, promoting things on the air he clearly didn’t believe in private, and calling for a reporter to be fired for daring to fact check Donald Trump’s election lies.\n\nIn other words, Carlson can’t be trusted.\n\nCarlson's move:Tucker Carlson to Twitter: Fired Fox News host reveals new home for an upcoming show\n\nThis didn’t stop him from spending most of the three-minute video raving about things like, “At the most basic level the news you consume is a lie. A lie of the stealthiest and most insidious kind. Facts have been withheld on purpose, along with proportion and perspective. You are being manipulated.”\n\nWho would know more about lying than Carlson? And is manipulation not leading an audience to conclusions that you in fact do not believe yourself to boost your ratings? Or is that just contempt for the people who watch?\n\nCarlson yammered on about the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to free speech. “Amazingly, as of tonight, there aren’t many platforms left that allow free speech,” he said. “The last big one remaining in the world, the only one, is Twitter.”\n\nRemember when Musk blocked the accounts of several prominent journalists? Carlson didn’t mention that. (Most of the bans were later lifted.)\n\nMusk's Twitter is right for Carlson for all the wrong reasons\n\nMusk has claimed to be an advocate of free speech on Twitter, which evidently meant welcoming back Trump, who had been permanently suspended after Jan. 6 “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nHate speech increased almost immediately after Musk took the reins of the platform. (Trump hasn't tweeted since the reinstatement, preferring his own Truth Social as a vehicle for spreading misinformation.)\n\nThis makes Twitter perfect for Carlson and his hectoring, bullying style, his white-nationalist leanings and his overall obnoxious manner. And if he can throw in a few lies about vaccines or downplay the Jan. 6 insurrection, so much the better from his point of view.\n\nThis is not to say that Twitter should keep Carlson off the platform. It’s Musk’s railroad now, and he can run it however he wants to. For the same reason suspending Trump was not a violation of the former president’s right to free speech — Twitter is a private company, not a government entity — Musk can welcome anyone he wants.\n\nThat said, anyone in their right mind who believes in responsible free speech — “responsible” being the key — wouldn't want to watch Carlson’s show anywhere.\n\nWill Tucker Carlson fans follow him to Twitter?\n\nBut alas, a lot of people do. Carlson got great ratings at Fox News, and its primetime ratings have suffered since his departure. Clearly he has an audience. Surely a sizable chunk of it will follow him to Twitter, where he has almost 7 million followers.\n\nWho knows what he’ll say when he finally gets going there? Fox News didn’t exercise much control over Carlson, but the idea of a completely unfiltered version of him — like what we see in his texts — is enough to make you shudder. Or log off of Twitter altogether.\n\nCarlson and Musk deserve each other. The rest of us don’t deserve this.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/09/15/fox-news-host-tucker-carlson-lies/8349425002/", "title": "'I lie': Oops.

It rains in Seattle. And the sky is blue. Some things you simply know without having to say them out loud. But Carlson did say the quiet part loud.\n\nThis is not me, a frequent Carlson critic, saying that he lies. Or not just me.\n\nThis is Carlson, in an interview over the weekend, saying so himself.\n\nCarlson was being interviewed by Dave Rubin on Rubin’s show “The Rubin Report,” which airs on YouTube and BlazeTV. It’s a chummy chat, of the “why are you so great?” variety. It certainly isn’t gotcha journalism. Carlson can’t say he was tricked into saying this.\n\nRubin was asking Carlson about CNN anchors like Brian Stelter, Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon — he called them \"clown people\" — who “just lie again and again.”\n\nMore:Fox News should fire Tucker Carlson before his bullying on COVID masks gets someone killed\n\nHere’s what Carlson said:\n\n“I guess I would ask myself, like, I mean, I lie if I’m cornered or something. I lie. I really try not to. I try never to lie on TV. I just don’t — I don’t like lying. I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever, but to systematically lie like that, without asking yourself, why am I doing this?”\n\nAnd there you have it. Tucker Carlson lies.\n\n'Enough':Meghan McCain's Twitter spat with Nicki Minaj over COVID-19 vaccination, explained\n\nCarlson's moment of introspection was fleeting, but important\n\nCarlson, the fleeting moment of introspection evidently gone, goes on to say that other anchors lie to protect the system, whatever that is. Fully recovered at this point, he reverts to sanctimonious mode, his default position: “How dare you do that? How dare you use your power to protect and guard the powerful?’\n\nHow indeed? There’s no evidence that's what they're doing. Unlike Carlson, they certainly haven’t admitted to it.\n\nNow Carlson has.\n\nIt matters.\n\nPeople have a funny idea about how journalism actually works. I often get emails from readers who believe that either my editors tell me what to write — they don’t, so the blame falls to me — or that some nefarious outfit somewhere pays journalists to write certain stories in certain ways, that we are essentially doing the bidding of political fixers somewhere.\n\nWe aren’t.\n\nWe also aren’t perfect. Journalists, including those who write or broadcast their opinions, sometimes make mistakes. No one is perfect, and no one worth reading or listening to claims to be. We try to be as accurate as possible at all times. When we make mistakes we do our best to fix them.\n\nCNN anchors make mistakes. MSNBC anchors make mistakes. Fox News anchors make mistakes. I make mistakes, too.\n\nNews is an on-the-go proposition. Stories change and journalists — reputable ones — report facts as they know them, responsibly and as quickly as they can. It’s far from a perfect system, but overall it works.\n\nMistakes are bad. Lies are worse\n\nBut mistakes are just that: mistakes.\n\nA lie is something different. Mistakes are bad. Lies are worse.\n\nA lie is intentional. Carlson didn’t spell out exactly when he lied, and Rubin wasn’t about to ask him; he seemed too giddy about talking with his pal and trashing CNN for anything like that.\n\nCarlson doesn’t have to spell it out. His admission puts anything he says under suspicion.\n\nWe know that he falsely claimed that George Floyd died of a drug overdose after autopsies ruled Floyd's death a homicide. He claimed there was “meaningful voter fraud” in Fulton County, Georgia, during the 2020 election. In April he said that maybe the COVID-19 vaccine “doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that.”\n\nThese aren’t mistakes. They’re lies. And they’re lies Carlson couches in such a way that he can come back and say something like: Wait, I said \"maybe.\" I was just repeating a theory some people are saying. I’m just throwing it out there.\n\nOr some such similar hogwash.\n\nIf Carlson was a radio host in the middle of some lonely nowhere railing against vaccine efficacy, it still wouldn’t be OK.\n\nBut millions of people watch Carlson. They listen to what he has to say. For whatever reason, many of them believe him.\n\nMaybe it’s time they stopped.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/12/17/bombshell-fact-check-megyn-kelly-rudy-giuliani-fox-news/4409759002/", "title": "'Bombshell' fact vs. fiction: What really happened at Fox News?", "text": "\"Bombshell\" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).\n\nThe drama (in theaters now) goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.\n\nFox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment on the film to USA TODAY beyond confirming that \"Bombshell\" producers \"never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production.”\n\nThe film was directed by Jay Roach (\"Trumbo\") and written by Charles Randolph (\"The Big Short\"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.\n\nIs Margot Robbie's character a real person?\n\nRobbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical (\"I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space,\" she says), Kayla soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.\n\nAlthough Kayla is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).\n\n\"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to,\" Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing. \"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life.\"\n\nReview:Charlize Theron transforms into Megyn Kelly, blasts the Fox News patriarchy in 'Bombshell'\n\n'I want my voice back':Gretchen Carlson calls for change on big 'Bombshell' day\n\nIs Kate McKinnon's character fictional, too?\n\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" favorite is a scene-stealer as Kayla's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.\n\nJess was \"all made up,\" Randolph says. \"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself.\"\n\n'You could do worse, right?' Megyn Kelly approves of Charlize Theron's 'Bombshell' casting\n\nRelated:Why is Fox News being sued again over alleged sexual harassment?\n\nDid someone actually poison Megyn Kelly?\n\nThe film begins with an anxious but steely Megyn en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts a cup of coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Roger, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.\n\nThe scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir \"Settle for More,\" although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned, tweeting that she contracted a \"stomach virus\" before the debate. But \"Bombshell\" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.\n\n\"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?' \" Randolph says. \"Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details.\"\n\nDid Roger Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani for legal advice?\n\n\"Bombshell\" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell (\"A Clockwork Orange\") as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton (\"Nashville\") as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's \"Mad About You\" star Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' longtime friend and confidante Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.\n\n\"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for,\" Randolph says. \"It shows the degree in which Roger was one of the drivers of the Republican establishment. If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations.\"\n\nWas Ailes really known as 'the legs man'?\n\nThe film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and \"almost never interacted,\" Randolph says.)\n\n\"Bombshell\" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography \"The Loudest Voice in the Room\" and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.\n\n\"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating specifically what happened to them,\" Randolph says.\n\nThe film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Kayla when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Kayla, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.\n\n\"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,' \" Randolph says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/18/fox-news-trial-delaware-live-updates-dominion-voting-election/70115075007/", "title": "Fox News trial: Settlement reached before opening arguments begin", "text": "Two hours after Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News was to start came word from the courtroom that the parties had settled their dispute.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nThe trial for the blockbuster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit Dominion Voting Systems has waged against Fox News and its parent company was set to begin today.\n\nOpening statements were slated to start at the New Castle County courthouse after jury selection is completed.

Some are even writing about it.\n\nBritain’s The Independent is calling the delay a “mystery” in its heading.\n\nReuters is reporting that a reason has not been provided for the delays, “but two sources previously told Reuters that Fox and Dominion had been holding last-minute settlement talks.”\n\nThe New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg is reporting the courtroom scene as “it is sweltering, everyone is up from their seats, going in and out of the room. Fox’s lead lawyer, Dan Webb, has taken several phone calls. Some people are standing, all are talking, others gesticulating. It's relative anarchy for Judge Davis’s court.”\n\nHe also said legal experts in the room told him “this delay is a highly unusual development just minutes before opening statements were set to begin.”\n\nJudge authorizes special master\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks — and according to ABC News, it looks like they were handed another ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled opening statements.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis had already rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case, ruling in favor of Dominion that the claims Fox aired about the company were indeed false. Newsworthiness, the judge ruled, is not a defense for defamation.\n\nDavis, during pretrial hearings, also sanctioned Fox’s legal team for withholding evidence, including recordings of a former Fox producer that involved Trump associates.\n\nOn Tuesday, just before opening statements were scheduled to start, Davis authorized an investigation into this issue to see if Fox needs to be sanctioned even further, ABC News reported. Davis last week reprimanded Fox’s lawyers, telling them they have a “credibility problem” and questioned if he could trust what they told him.

The children, who looked elementary or middle school-aged, yelled out the window at all the media lined up outside the courthouse. The kids laughed and stuck their tongues out, clearly excited about the commotion.\n\nWill Kenkel, a local, stood outside the Wilmington courthouse with a sign that read “Tucker Carlson, ditch the fascistic, stick w/ fish sticks.\"\n\nKenkel, who made the sign himself, said the slogan was prompted by his wife, who couldn't tell if he was saying \"fascistic\" or \"fish sticks.\"\n\nWhile Kenkel didn't mention Carlson's family fortune, the TV host's father married the heiress to Swanson frozen foods when Carlson was 10. The frozen food empire is well known for its fish sticks.\n\nKenkel said he was a little bit worried Monday when they delayed the trial, joking that if they settled, his knee pain from making the sign was going to be for naught.\n\nHe added that he plans to protest throughout the weeks-long trial.\n\nMore:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case.

He held a small sign that said, in all capital letters, \"Fox + GOP = fascist propaganda.\"\n\nObjections to opening statements\n\nThe final part of jury selection has officially started.\n\nJust before, lawyers for each side indicated they have objections to each other's opening statement slides.

Trial to begin Monday\n\nIn the course of the upcoming six weeks, a dozen jurors will hear the evidence with 12 alternates, who will fill in if jurors have to drop out due to sickness or other circumstances.\n\nWaiting for the trial to start\n\nReporters began lining up outside of a Leonard L. Williams Justice Center courtroom before 7 a.m. when the room opened an hour later.Reporters have two options to watch the trial: They can watch from the courtroom or via a livestream in a neighboring courtroom – both on the seventh floor.\n\nOutside the Wilmington courthouse, media largely swarmed the area. But one man held a handmade sign saying, “Make Them Pay” and “Fox is guilty.”\n\nThe man appeared to focus on a group of well-dressed people, though it’s unclear what their role in the trial is. One man in a suit and two women stood in the group chatting. As the news cameras gathered around them to take a photo of the protester, they would move.\n\nMobile billboards\n\nTwo mobile billboard trucks trolling Fox News have been circling the area near Wilmington’s Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, where the Fox News defamation trial is scheduled to start.\n\nThe mobile billboards, commissioned by left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters for America, have messages reading “Fox News Lied,” “Lachlan Murdoch Knew,” “Rupert Murdoch Knew,” “Tucker Carlson Knew,” “They All Knew,” “FoxKnew.com”\n\nThe billboards highlight that Fox News knew the election fraud claims Trump’s team was pushing in 2020 were lies and promoted them anyway, according to a statement by Media Matters for America. The billboards specifically call out Fox Corp.'s chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who are scheduled to testify at the trial.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., the trucks moved from their spot on King Street and began driving down the road, turning onto Fourth Street as they circled the courthouse. As they drove by a DART bus stop, one man looked at them and smiled, saying “wow, wow.”\n\n“That’s wild, isn't it?” he said.\n\nWhat to expect at the trial and what's at stake\n\nDozens of journalists are expected to flock to Delaware to cover the trial. This case will also likely be one of the most significant trials The First State has ever hosted.

Khris Middleton also left the game with an injury.\n\nThe Bucks entered the week with a magic number of 4. Three straight wins over four days and a Boston Celtics loss on Tuesday ended the drama.\n\nWhat is the Bucks' record?\n\nMilwaukee finished with a 58-24 record. The Bucks are 32-9 at home this season and 26-15 on the road.\n\nWhen is the Milwaukee Bucks' next game?\n\nThe regular season is over. The playoffs begin for the Bucks on Sunday, April 16, at Fiserv Forum in Game 1 of a first-round series. Their opponent is not yet determined.\n\nWho is the Eastern Conference's second-best team?\n\nThe Boston Celtics. They finished with a 57-25 record. The reigning Eastern Conference champion Celtics will be the No. 2 seed this season. It's the same seed they had last year on their way to the NBA Finals.\n\nWho had the tiebreaker if both the Bucks and Celtics had finished with the same record?\n\nThanks to winning the season series over the Bucks, 2-1, the Celtics would have earned the No. 1 seed if both teams had finished the regular season with the same records. But since the Bucks have a three-game lead over the Celtics with two games to play for both teams, Milwaukee will finish with at least a one-game edge.\n\nThe Celtics defeated the Bucks, 139-118, in a Christmas Day showdown at TD Garden as Jayson Tatum scored 41 points; the Bucks won, 131-125, in overtime on Feb. 14 behind 40 from Jrue Holiday, with many of Boston's stars out of the lineup, and the Celtics just trounced the Bucks March 30, 140-99, at Fiserv Forum. Tatum reached the 40-point mark again, while Jaylen Brown added 30 on 13 of 20 shooting.\n\nWhat teams in the Eastern Conference made the playoffs or in the play-in tournament?\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (58-24) Boston Celtics (57-25) Philadelphia 76ers (54-28) Cleveland Cavaliers (51-31) New York Knicks (47-35) Brooklyn Nets (45-37) Miami Heat (44-38) Atlanta Hawks (41-41) Toronto Raptors (41-41) Chicago Bulls (40-42)\n\nTeams 1-6 have qualified for the playoffs, while teams 7-10 are competing in a play-in tournament this week.\n\nDo the Bucks have the best record in the NBA?\n\nYes.\n\nThe West-leading Denver Nuggets finished with a 52-29 record. The Bucks will have home court throughout the playoffs and will host the first two games of the NBA Finals if they get there.\n\nThe Bucks did not have home-court advantage when they won the NBA title in 2021 over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nWhen do the NBA playoffs start?\n\nTeams in the 7-10 seed range will compete in a play-in tournament beginning April 11. The Bucks' first-round series begins Sunday, April 16. Games 1 and 2 of that best-of-seven series will be played at Fiserv Forum.\n\nWho could the Bucks play in the first round as the No. 1 seed?\n\nThat's unclear due to the many scenarios of the play-in tournament but it's down to four teams.\n\nThe 4-5 and 3-6 matchups of the first round will be known after the regular season is over on Sunday, April 9. But now that the NBA has implemented a play-in tournament the last few seasons, the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds won't initially know their first-round opponents.\n\nMore:Who are the Bucks most likely to face in the first round of the NBA playoffs?\n\nHow does the NBA play-in tournament work in 2023?\n\nHere's how it works: The No. 9-seeded team plays the No. 10-seeded team in a game, while the No. 7-seeded team plays the No. 8-seeded team. The loser of the 9-10 matchup is eliminated. The winner of the 7-8 game advances to play the No. 2 seed in the first round. The winner of the 9-10 matchup plays the loser of the 7-8 game for the right to advance to play the No. 1 seed in the first round.\n\nThe Miami Heat (No. 7 seed) play the Atlanta Hawks, the eighth seed, in a play-in game, while the No. 9 Toronto Raptors and No. 10 Chicago Bulls play in the other opening-round play-in game with the loser eliminated.\n\nThe Bucks have recent playoff history with all these teams.\n\nMilwaukee eliminated the Bulls in five games in the first round of last year's playoffs; the Bucks beat the Heat and Hawks on their way to the NBA title in 2021; the Heat upset the No. 1-seeded Bucks in the \"playoff bubble\" in 2020; the Raptors knocked out the No. 1 Bucks in the 2019 Eastern Conference finals.\n\nMore:Combination of Khris Middleton and Joe Ingles have Bucks primed for playoffs\n\nMore:Bucks' Bobby Portis wants to 'talk real talk' on new podcast, and show people who he is off the court", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2023/04/06/who-are-bucks-possible-2023-first-round-nba-playoff-matchups/70089026007/", "title": "Who are Bucks' possible 2023 first-round NBA playoff matchups?", "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks locked up the best record in the NBA with a win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, meaning they can now focus on the playoffs. The only problem is not knowing which team will greet them at Fiserv Forum late next week.\n\nHere's a look at the four strongest possible foes.\n\nWhen will the Bucks begin play in the playoffs?\n\nThe earliest game could be Saturday, April 15 (but it will almost certainly be April 16), and the first two games of the opening series will be held in Milwaukee at Fiserv Forum.\n\nHow does the play-in tournament work?\n\nThe format was adopted for the first time last season.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nThe seventh and eighth seeds in the NBA playoffs for each conference are determined by winners in the play-in series. The Bucks will draw the eighth seed since they have locked up the No. 1 seed in the East.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 11, teams that finished No. 7 and No. 8 in the regular season standings will square off in each conference, and the winner will get designated as the seventh-seed for the playoffs. That team will get paired with the second-seed in each conference for a first-round, seven-game series (that'll be Boston in the East). The loser of the game must win a do-or-die game three days later to make the playoffs.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 12, the No. 9 and No. 10 seeds in each conference will meet. The loser will be eliminated from the postseason, and the winner will advance to the do-or-die game two days later.\n\nOn Friday, April 14, the losers of the first games and the winners of the second games will meet. The loser will be eliminated, and the winner will get the eighth seed in the postseason. In the East, that team will face the Bucks.\n\nThough the \"regular\" portion of the playoffs begin the next day, both teams that earned the eighth seed in 2022 were afforded (logically) a day of rest and opened their series two days after clinching a berth. Common sense tells you the Bucks will begin play Sunday, April 16.\n\nWhich team is the Bucks' most likely opponent in the first round of the playoffs?\n\nSince the Bucks could face any one of the four teams in the play-in series, they won't know their opponent until two days before their series begins (though they'll know it's one of two teams by that point).\n\nOn paper, the likeliest foe is the Atlanta Hawks, a team that entered Thursday with the No. 8 spot in the standings, one game ahead of the Raptors (but owning the tiebreaker between the two teams with two games left). If everything held according to standings, the Hawks would lose the first game to the seventh-place Heat and defeat either the Raptors or Bulls for the eighth spot. But, of course, in the context of single-game outcomes, anything is possible.\n\nHere's what to know about the possible first-round foes, from most likely to least likely:\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nRecord (through Wednesday): 41-39\n\n41-39 Rank in East: No. 8\n\nNo. 8 Leading scorer: Trae Young (26.2 ppg)\n\nTrae Young (26.2 ppg) Coach: Quin Snyder\n\nQuin Snyder Against Bucks this year: 2-2 (Bucks 123, Hawks 115 on Oct. 29; Hawks 117, Bucks 98 on Nov. 7; Hawks 121, Bucks 106 on Nov. 14; Bucks 114, Hawks 105 on Jan. 11). Khris Middleton did not play in any of the four games. Trae Young did not play for the Hawks in one win and one loss.\n\n2-2 (Bucks 123, Hawks 115 on Oct. 29; Hawks 117, Bucks 98 on Nov. 7; Hawks 121, Bucks 106 on Nov. 14; Bucks 114, Hawks 105 on Jan. 11). Khris Middleton did not play in any of the four games. Trae Young did not play for the Hawks in one win and one loss. Playoff history: Bucks beat the Hawks in 2021 conference finals, 4-2; Hawks beat the Bucks in 2010 first round, 4-3; Bucks beat the Hawks in 1989 first round, 3-2; Hawks beat the Bucks in 1988 first round, 3-2; Bucks beat the Hawks in 1984 first round, 3-2.\n\nAs you can see, these teams have had some wildly competitive games over the years, most recently in the Eastern Conference Finals when the Bucks won the 2021 title. The 2010 \"Fear the Deer\" team took favored Atlanta to the wire in 2010, and every battle in the 1980s when the maximum allotment of games.\n\nThe Hawks have proven pesky this year for the Bucks, and Young (who averages 10.0 assists per game along with 26.2 points) is one of the league's stars. He and Dejounte Murray (20.5 ppg) have been healthy most of the season, and De'Andre Hunter (15.4 points) is a tough third option that Milwaukee never had to deal with in 2021 because he was injured.\n\nThere's also the great what-if with Bogdan Bogdanović, a player Milwaukee thought it had traded for prior to 2021 before the deal fell apart and Milwaukee was hit with a tampering penalty. John Collins (13.0 points, 6.5 rebounds) and Clint Capela (12.0 points, 11.1 rebounds, 1.2 blocks) also figure heavily into the equation.\n\nThe Hawks are seventh in the league in offensive rating and are among the best teams in the league at taking care of the basketball (12.9 turnovers per game, third in NBA). But they're 21st in the league in three-point percentage (35.4%) and don't shoot it much, anyway. They also have the 22nd best defensive rating.\n\nNicolet High School alumnus Jalen Johnson gets 14.8 minutes per game for the Hawks and scores 5.5 points per contest.\n\nThe Heat has won three of four meetings between the two squads this year if the standings hold and the two teams meet in the first play-in game.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nRecord (through Wednesday): 42-37\n\n42-37 Rank in East: No. 7\n\nNo. 7 Leading scorer: Jimmy Butler (22.9 ppg)\n\nJimmy Butler (22.9 ppg) Coach: Erik Spoelstra\n\nErik Spoelstra Against Bucks this year: 2-2 (Bucks 127, Heat 99 on Feb. 24; Bucks 123, Heat 115 on Feb. 4; Heat 111, Bucks 95 on Jan. 14; Heat 108, Bucks 102 on Jan. 12). The Bucks were without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton in both losses, but the Heat's Tyler Herro did not play in those games, either.\n\n2-2 (Bucks 127, Heat 99 on Feb. 24; Bucks 123, Heat 115 on Feb. 4; Heat 111, Bucks 95 on Jan. 14; Heat 108, Bucks 102 on Jan. 12). The Bucks were without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton in both losses, but the Heat's Tyler Herro did not play in those games, either. Playoff history: Bucks beat the Heat in 2021 first round, 4-0; Heat beat the Bucks in 2020 conference semifinals, 4-1; Heat beat the Bucks in 2013 first round, 4-0.\n\nThe Bucks and Heat have some illustrious playoff history, with a first-round series win en route to the 2021 title (starting with a Khris Middleton buzzer-beater in overtime), one year after the Bucks suffered a humbling defeat to the Heat as the No. 1 seed in the \"bubble\" playoffs in Orlando. In 2013, top-seeded Miami made quick work of the Bucks, but Brandon Jennings confidently expressed that his team would win in six games, a sentiment that became cemented in Bucks lore.\n\nThe Heat held the top seed in last year's playoffs before falling to Boston in the conference finals and returned 13 players from that roster, but still, they've taken a step back. The fourth-best team in the NBA by defensive rating last year fell to ninth this year (and have particularly struggled since the all-star break). Teams are shooting 37% from three-point range, which ranks Miami 23rd in the league.\n\nOn the other end, the team has faced some regression in its three-point shooting. After shooting 37.9% last year to lead the league, the Heat has fallen way off the map to 27th at 34.1%. The team's offensive rating ranked it 10th last year; it's 25th now.\n\nThe usual suspects are still there: Marquette alumnus Jimmy Butler leads the team with 22.9 points per game, and Herro, a Whitnall High School graduate, moved to the starting lineup this year after winning last year's NBA sixth man of the year, and he's scoring 20.3 points per game. Bam Adebayo adds 20.7, brings in 9.3 rebounds and has historically been a very tough defender to deal with.\n\nBut after that, the team isn't seeing near the production from others such as Max Strus, Kyle Lowry, Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent and Duncan Robinson, the latter of whom has become an afterthought down to 33.5% shooting from deep after hitting 45, 41 and 37% the last three years.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nRecord (through Wednesday): 40-40\n\n40-40 Rank in East: No. 9\n\nNo. 9 Leading scorer: Pascal Siakam (24.3 ppg)\n\nPascal Siakam (24.3 ppg) Coach: Nick Nurse\n\nNick Nurse Against Bucks this year: 0-3 (Bucks 104, Raptors 101 on Jan. 4; Bucks 130, Raptors 122 on Jan. 17; Bucks 118, Raptors 111 on March 19; game to be played April 9) The Bucks were without Khris Middleton in two of the three meetings.\n\n0-3 (Bucks 104, Raptors 101 on Jan. 4; Bucks 130, Raptors 122 on Jan. 17; Bucks 118, Raptors 111 on March 19; game to be played April 9) The Bucks were without Khris Middleton in two of the three meetings. Playoff history: Raptors beat the Bucks in 2019 conference finals, 4-2; Raptors beat the Bucks in 2017 first round, 4-2\n\nBucks fans won't easily forget Fred VanVleet's excellent performance off the bench in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2019, as he and Siakam both keyed a heartbreaking outcome for Milwaukee when the Raptors went on to win the NBA championship. VanVleet remains a problem at 19.5 points per game, and Siakam leads the team in scoring and sits second in rebounding (7.9) and assists (5.9 behind VanVleet's 7.2).\n\nThis is the best team in the league at taking care of the basketball, and also a team capable of limiting shots (with a 12th-ranked offensive rating and 11th-ranked defensive rating). But the Raptors don't shoot the ball well, with a 33.6% mark from three that ranks 28th in the league and an overall percentage of 45.8% that ranks 26th. Meanwhile, opponents shoot it well (49%), even if opportunities are fewer thanks to the team's strengths of steals and offensive rebounding.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nRecord (through Wednesday): 38-42\n\n38-42 Rank in East: No. 10\n\nNo. 10 Leading scorer: Zach LaVine (24.9 ppg)\n\nZach LaVine (24.9 ppg) Coach: Billy Donovan\n\nBilly Donovan Against Bucks this year: 2-2 (Bulls 118, Bucks 113 on Nov. 23; Bulls 119, Bucks 113 on Dec. 28; Bucks 112, Bulls 100 on Feb. 16; Bucks 105, Bulls 92 on April 5). The Bucks only had Khris Middleton for 8 minutes in the four games combined (all in the final meeting). Giannis didn't play in the final win and played nine minutes in February win.\n\n2-2 (Bulls 118, Bucks 113 on Nov. 23; Bulls 119, Bucks 113 on Dec. 28; Bucks 112, Bulls 100 on Feb. 16; Bucks 105, Bulls 92 on April 5). The Bucks only had Khris Middleton for 8 minutes in the four games combined (all in the final meeting). Giannis didn't play in the final win and played nine minutes in February win. Playoff history: Bucks beat the Bulls in 2022 first round, 4-1; Bulls beat the Bucks in 2015 first round, 4-2; Bulls beat the Bucks in 1990 first round, 3-1; Bucks beat the Bulls in 1985 first round, 3-1; Bucks beat the Bulls in 1974 first round, 4-0.\n\nThe Bucks overcame a slow start in last year's playoffs before prevailing in four lopsided wins against a Bulls team that has many of the same top players, a core that's been healthy most of the year. LaVine (24.9 ppg), DeMar DeRozan (24.7), Nikola Vučević (17.7) and Patrick Williams (10.1) all hit double figures, with Coby White (9.5) coming off the bench. Vučević is a force, with 11.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game while shooting 59.4% from the floor, and he's started all 80 games this season for Chicago.\n\nIt's a good shooting team overall, with a 49.1% field-goal mark third-best in the league. But the Bulls are actually better on defense (fifth-best defensive rating comared to 23rd on offense). The Bulls don't take many shots from deep (30th in the league at 10.5 makes and 28.8 attempts per game) and are fortunate with their losing record that the play-in format embraces as many as 10 teams per league. They've safely clinched a spot in the series, more than three games better than the Magic.\n\nOne potential longshot: Brooklyn Nets\n\nIt's possible Brooklyn could still fall to the No. 7 spot in the East, but the Nets' magic number to secure a top-six spot is one, with two games left against the Magic and 76ers. Miami would also need to win its last three against Philadelphia, Washington and Orlando to bypass Brooklyn. And then Brooklyn would need to lose its play-in game before winning the second to get here.\n\nThe Nets, of course, have undergone a transformation in recent years and this year sent stars Kyrie Irving (Dallas) and Kevin Durant (Phoenix) to the Western Conference while rebuilding under coach Jacque Vaughn, who was promoted to replace Steve Nash early in the season.\n\nMikal Bridges leads the team with 27.4 points per game since he came from Phoenix in the Durant trade, and Spencer Dinwiddie adds 16.9 per game since coming back to the Nets from Dallas. Cameron Johnson (16.5 ppg) is another nice ex-Sun for the Nets to build around. Ben Simmons is also still around, but he hasn't played since February and has been ruled out for the year with a nerve impingement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2021/05/16/seven-things-know-milwaukees-playoff-opponent-miami/5122402001/", "title": "Seven things to know about the Miami Heat, Milwaukee's first-round ...", "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks will begin the 2021 NBA playoffs as the No. 3 seed, facing the No. 6 seeded Miami Heat. Yep, that's the same team that eliminated the Bucks from last year's playoffs, and it's a team that features many of the same names. Take a look at this year's Miami team to get a sense of what the Bucks will be facing.\n\nProjected starters\n\nJimmy Butler (21.5 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 7.1 apg)\n\nBam Adebayo (18.9 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 5.4 apg)\n\nDuncan Robinson (13.1 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 1.8 apg)\n\nKendrick Nunn (14.3 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 2.6 apg)\n\nTrevor Ariza (9.3 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.9 apg)\n\nTop reserves\n\nTyler Herro (15.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 3.3 apg)\n\nGoran Dragic (13.4 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 2.1 apg)\n\nDewayne Dedmon (7.1 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 0.8 apg)\n\nAndre Iguodala (4.4 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.2 apg)\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nCoach: Erik Spoelstra\n\nThis Heat team can't be as good as last year's, right?\n\nThe Heat went 44-29 last year and wound up with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs, then memorably rampaged to the NBA Finals. From a win/loss standpoint, this year's team isn't as strong, but the Heat has many of the same principal characters and many of the same statistical strengths.\n\nPerhaps because of a quick turnaround following its deep playoff run, Miami started the year 7-12, and Jimmy Butler was nursing an ankle injury at the season's outset, so keep that in mind. By contrast, it had won 7 of 8 heading into a loss with the Bucks on Saturday.\n\nThe Heat was 22-24 after a March 26 loss to Charlotte. It's gone 18-8 since.\n\nStill, the Heat has gone from a top-10 offense to nearly a bottom-third one, ranking 20th with a 110.5 offensive rating. At 111.9 last year, the Heat was seventh.\n\nHeat gums up the paint\n\nLike last year's team, the Heat is still the best team in the NBA at limiting two-pointers, as its 41.2 points per game allowed in the paint is the stingiest in the league this year. Adebayo probably won't win defensive player of the year honors, but he certainly has a case (just ask him) and continues to lock up superstars on a regular basis.\n\nThe big story line from last year's playoff series was that Miami found a way to set up a \"wall\" and limit the output of Giannis Antetokounmpo. That's true to a degree, but it's easy to forget that Giannis still had 29 points in Game 2 on 10-of-18 shooting and then 19 points in 12 minutes (8-of-10 shooting) before leaving Game 4 with an injury and not returning.\n\nThe Heat opened a 3-0 lead in the series, so the Antetokounmpo injury wasn't really the turning point, but it's worth remembering that he wasn't there for the elimination game.\n\nThe three-point shooting isn't as good as last year, but that boils down to Duncan Robinson\n\nThe team leaders are the same: Butler (21.5 ppg, 6.9 rebounds) and Adebayo (18.9 ppg, 9.0 rpg) despite neither being efficient from three-point range. Butler was at 19.9 ppg and 6.7 rpg last year, and Adebayo was 15.9 and 10.2. Everyone else can shoot, including sniper Duncan Robinson, but the team's overall three-point production has dropped largely because Robinson is no longer hitting threes at a record pace.\n\nLast year's Heat team shot 37.9% from three-point range, but this year's is down to 35.6%, ranking just 20th in the league (although it was only 35.9% in the playoffs last year, and we saw how that worked out).\n\nRobinson shot 44.6% last year; this year, he's down to 40.7%. He scored only 9.0 points per game in the playoff series last year, so he also wasn't an X-factor in Milwaukee's struggles.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami is giving up the second-most three-pointers in the league (20) and a 36.6% mark (middle of the pack). Last year, they were also surrendering a ton but only allowing a 34.7% success rate, which was sixth in the NBA.\n\nThe local kid is still making good\n\nTyler Herro's shooting efficiency has taken a dip as he's fought through a foot injury, but his raw numbers are about on par to last year, if not a little better.\n\nThe Greenfield native and product of Whitnall High School had a breakout rookie season, capped with a playoff run that included a memorable 37-point game.\n\nHis 10-for-15 showing for 24 points with 11 rebounds against Boston on May 11 might be a sign that he's back to full strength.\n\n\"I didn’t forget how to play basketball,\" Herro was quoted as saying in the Miami Herald. \"[There have been] a lot of ups and downs, but I’m sticking with it. I’m going to continue to get better every day. The results don’t always show how hard someone is working every single day.”\n\nIn the six games before the meeting with the Bucks, he hit 23 of 36 from three-point range before going 0 for 5 against Milwaukee.\n\nHerro and Goran Dragic both missed a chunk of games this year with injury, though they're both apparently healthy now. That's another explanation for Miami's so-so overall record.\n\nThe Victor Oladipo trade went for naught\n\nThe acquisition of Victor Oladipo at the trade deadline looked like a move that could launch the Heat into another tier, but he underwent surgery on his right quadriceps tendon and is done for the year. Role players Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley are now in Houston as a result of the trade.\n\nMoreover, this year's Heat team doesn't have Jae Crowder, now in Phoenix, after the former Marquette University star proved to be a thorn in Milwaukee's side in last year's playoffs. He shot 43.1% from three-point range and averaged 15.2 points against the Bucks over the five games, his best career playoff series when it comes to scoring.\n\nJimmy Butler is lurking\n\nThe Bucks have not seen Jimmy Butler at all this season in three games, with the former Marquette University star nursing injuries at various times. He missed the teams' final meeting of the year May 15 with a bad back, but he still played in 52 games, which is just a small tick below his other recent seasons. His 2.1 steals per game lead the NBA, and he was an absolute monster in the series with the Bucks last year, averaging 23.4 points.\n\nHow did Miami fare against the Bucks in the regular season?\n\nDec. 29: Milwaukee 144, Miami 97. The cathartic win for the Bucks still represents Miami's biggest loss of the season, but Jimmy Butler also didn't play for the Heat, which shot less than 30% from three-point range and surrendered 46 points to Milwaukee in the first quarter. The Bucks made 29 triples for the night, setting an NBA record and hitting 56.9%. Jrue Holiday hit 6 of 10 threes and 9 of 15 overall to show how he might be a fly in the ointment this time around for the Heat, and the team romped even with Giannis Antetokounmpo scoring only nine points. Khris Middleton made 10 of 13 shots for 25 points, and Milwaukee forced 22 turnovers.\n\nDec. 30: Miami 119, Milwaukee 108. Everyone knew the three-point performance the night before wasn't sustainable, but a fourth-quarter collapse in Miami left the Bucks with a sour taste in their mouths. Butler again didn't play, and two Heat players no longer on the squad, Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk, combined to hit 11 of 21 shots, as the Heat outscored Milwaukee in the final dismal quarter, 31-17.\n\nMiddleton and Holiday, so crucial in the win the night before, went cold and finished a combined 7 of 30 from the floor. Antetokounmpo had a triple double.\n\nMay 15: Milwaukee 122, Miami 108. Though the Bucks came into the game perhaps with some question as to their motivation -- should they take the foot off the gas knowing a Heat win would put Miami in better seeding position for the playoffs and decrease the chances the two teams meet in the playoffs? Milwaukee showed where it stood with a resounding start, scoring 44 points in the first quarter and maintaining comfortable distance most of the night. Six players scored at least 14 points, but once again, Butler did not play for Miami.\n\nJR Radcliffe can be reached at (262) 361-9141 or jradcliffe@gannett.com.

But the former Marquette star certainly tried to top it to eliminate the Bucks, scoring 26 points after halftime.\n\n\"Credit to Butler,\" Budenholzer said. \"He played at a high level, really, all five games.\n\n\"Threw some different guys at him tonight. I love our guys. I love their effort. They left it all out there. Butler was very, very good tonight and every night.\"\n\nMatthews was one of the defensive switchups on Butler, but he battled through a calf injury suffered in Game 1 that kept him out of the last three matchups.\n\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Matthews said about how he felt in Game 5. \"I go out there and leave everything I had out there. Credit to the Heat, they beat us.\n\n\"At this point in the year, no one is 100%. We let this one get away from us.\"\n\nMatthews had the utmost respect for his fellow former MU star after Butler averaged 37.6 points in the series.\n\n\"He's making shots,\" Matthews said. \"Plays downhill. Plays with force. Gets to the free-throw line.\"\n\nBig nights for Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton aren't enough\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's back injury in after 11 minutes in Game 1 changed the complexion of the series. He returned in Game 4 for a triple-double and looked even more dominant in Game 5 with 38 points and 20 rebounds.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Antetokounmpo said of his injury. \"It's over. We lost. The series is over. It doesn't matter.\"\n\nKhris Middleton, after struggling in down the stretch in Game 4 as the Bucks blew a 14-point lead, came out hot on Wednesday. He had 17 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first quarter and finished with 33.\n\nThe rest of the Bucks shot just 18 for 40.\n\nJrue Holiday was 4 for 11 for 16 points, and added nine rebounds and six assists.\n\n\"I don't think the shots went in,\" Holiday said. \"I did think we had a lot of good shots that we typically make. But sometimes they don't fall.\"\n\nHoliday was also the primary defender on Butler. Antetokounmpo felt Holiday was depleted while guarding the Heat star.\n\n\"I think Jrue did his best,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"But at the end of the day, he gets tired. He's got to rebound the ball, he's got to pass the ball, he's got to score the ball, he's got to guard Jimmy. You get tired.\n\n\"Maybe you could have done some double-teaming more. Make him pass the ball. Maybe switch the matchup. Give Jrue a break, maybe 2-3 minutes. But I don't think as a team we make as many adjustments as we could against him.\"\n\nHoliday didn't want any excuses.\n\n\"That's what I'm here for,\" Holiday said. \"I'm here for the challenge. Even if I get my (expletive) busted. I'm here to play basketball and go as hard as I can.\"\n\nBucks struggle late in game again\n\nThe final 17 minutes of the game will be endlessly scrutinized by Bucks fans.\n\nMilwaukee shot 3 for 19 in the fourth quarter and then 2 for 6 in overtime.\n\nAntetokounmpo was 1 for 9 in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"The ball did not go in,\" he said. \"It's as simple as that. Got to my spot. I wasn't able to make shots. That's pretty much it. If I had made the shots it would have been a different case.\"\n\nBudenholzer will draw ire for not calling a timeout after Butler's layup and the end of regulation with .5 seconds on the clock. The Bucks could have advanced the ball and then set up their own lob play.\n\n\"Yeah, we needed to call a timeout there,\" Budenholzer said after the game.\n\nBudenholzer also didn't call timeout at the end of overtime as Antetokounmpo pushed the ball up the floor.\n\n\"Giannis attacked,\" Budenholzer said. \"Giannis got the ball to Khris. Khris attacked.\n\n\"That's how we always play. It's been very good for us. And we weren't able to convert it tonight.\"\n\nInstead the ball ended up in Allen's hands and the final shot of the season came after the buzzer.\n\nIt will lead to a lot of soul-searching in the longer-than-expected off-season.\n\n\"That's life,\" Matthews said. \"I go down. Giannis goes down. They lose (Tyler) Herro. Vic (Oladipo) goes down. Gotta battle. And we came up short.\n\n\"Where do we go from here? Day at a time. I know this is going to stick with me for I don't know how long.\"\n\nFive numbers\n\n42-2 Bucks' record in the regular season with double-digit leads in the fourth quarter\n\n3 Eighth seeds to beat No. 1 seedings in the era of seven-game first-round series\n\n8 Different players for the Heat to score in the first quarter\n\n3 Heat players to foul out – Bam Adebayo, Kevin Love and Kyle Lowry\n\n17 Missed free throws for the Bucks\n\nPlay of the game was Jimmy Butler's game-tying bucket\n\nThis one will go down in Heat lore and Bucks infamy.

He had a lot to say on the matter.\n\n\"Do you get a promotion every year, in your job?\" Antetokounmpo asked the reporter. \"No, right? So every year you work is a failure? Yes or no? No. Every year you work, you work toward something, towards a goal, which is to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your family, provide a house for them or take care of your parents.

Hopefully we can win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo, the 2021 Finals MVP said, before reiterating his point with a reminder of the Bucks' history. \"So, 50 years from 1971 to 2021 that we didn't win a championship, it was 50 years of failure?

The bad news: the other three teams did not.\n\nHere's a look at the history of 3-1 deficits and eighth seeds staging first-round uprisings.\n\nThe 2003 Detroit Pistons prevailed after going down in the first round, 3-1\n\nThere is one example of a No. 1 seed going down by a 3-1 count and rallying to win. In the first year of the seven-game format for first-round series, the 2003 Pistons battled back against Orlando to prevail.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nIt was the first time the NBA had gone to the seven-game format for all rounds since 1974, though the 1974 playoffs featured just four teams per conference and essentially didn't have a \"first round\" that we have now.\n\nThe Pistons-Magic first-round series in the Eastern Conference transpired the way the Bucks-Heat series has, with Orlando winning Game 1 in Auburn Hills and Detroit evening the series before the Magic won both Game 3 and Game 4 in Orlando.\n\nDetroit won the final three games convincingly, including a 98-67 win in Game 5 and a 103-88 victory on the road in Game 6 before a 108-93 triumph to win the series.\n\nDetroit went on to win a conference-semifinals series with Philadelphia but got swept by second-seeded New Jersey in the conference finals, 4-0.\n\nMore:'It's not over': Bucks must overcome history, Jimmy Butler to rebound from 3-1 series deficit\n\nOther teams that overcame 3-1 deficits and then won the NBA title\n\nIf you want an even better example, consider the Houston Rockets in 1995, who bounced back from a 2-0 and 3-1 deficit in the Western Conference semifinals against the Phoenix Suns and went on to win the NBA championship as the No. 6 seed. Houston defeated San Antonio in the conference finals and swept Orlando in the NBA finals.\n\nWe recognize that it's a little dicey if you're consulting an example from when Giannis Antetokounmpo was less than 1 year old. Still, there are other examples of teams that went down 3-1 but battled back for the title.\n\nThe 1981 Boston Celtics also went down to Philadelphia by a 3-1 count in the Eastern Conference finals, then won the next three games by a combined five points (two two-point wins and a 91-90 win in Game 7). Boston went on to win the NBA title over Houston, 4-2.\n\nIf you want to go way back, the Boston Celtics went down 3-1 to Philly in the 1968 Eastern Division Finals, as well, but overcame that deficit and won the NBA title over Los Angeles, 4-2.\n\nThe 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers famously bounced back from a 3-1 deficit to win the NBA championship over the Golden State Warriors, led by a Herculean performance by LeBron James. The Warriors had posted the best record in NBA history that year (73-9).\n\nThus, there are four teams to battle back from a 3-1 deficit at any point in the postseason and go on to win the NBA title. In all, there are 13 examples of it happening in NBA history. That's 4.8% of the time in series featuring a 3-1 lead at any point. So you're saying there's a chance...!\n\nOther recent teams have overcome a 3-1 deficit\n\nThe 2020 Denver Nuggets (seeded third) bounced back twice in the same postseason, winning against the Utah Jazz in the first round and the Los Angeles Clippers in the conference semifinals before falling to the Lakers in the conference finals, 4-1. If you want to discount everything that happened in the \"bubble\" postseason, you'd be well within your right to do so.\n\nThe 2016 Golden State Warriors themselves bounced back from a 3-1 deficit to topple the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western finals before getting ahead of Cleveland in the NBA Finals, 3-1. The Warriors, as a reminder, had just posted the best regular season of all time.\n\nThe 2015 Houston Rockets went down 3-1 against the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western semifinals before prevailing, then fell to Golden State in the conference finals, 4-1.\n\nThe 2006 Phoenix Suns rallied back in the Western Conference first round to stun the Lakers, then defeated the Clippers in seven games before falling to Dallas in the Western finals.\n\nOther examples included the 1997 Miami Heat, bouncing back from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Knicks in 1997 in the Eastern Conference semifinals, though a fight during the series caused several player suspensions. Chicago beat Miami in the conference finals, 4-1.\n\nThe 1979 Washington Bullets rallied from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Spurs in the Eastern Conference finals and lost to Seattle in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe 1970 Lakers battled back to beat the Suns in the Western Division semifinals and eventually lost in seven games to the Knicks in the NBA Finals.\n\nSo nearly 38% of these occasions have taken place since 2015, which tells you it's much more likely than it used to be.\n\nNow the bad news: the No. 1 seeds that lost to No. 8 seeds\n\nIn 2012, the Bulls won the first game of their series with No. 8 Philadelphia but then lost the next three games after reigning MVP guard Derrick Rose tore his ACL in the fourth quarter of Game 1. The Bulls still won Game 5 but then ceded the series, 4-2, with Andre Iguodala hitting clinching free throws in the final seconds of Game 6. Philly then took Boston to seven games in the next round before falling.\n\nIn 2011, the Memphis Grizzlies shocked the San Antonio Spurs, 4-2. Not only that, but San Antonio needed overtime at home to win Game 5, 110-103, before Memphis won Game 6 back at its place.\n\nMemphis then pushed Oklahoma City to seven games in the next round before falling short.\n\nIn 2007, Golden State took down the Dallas Mavericks, 4-2, backed by an unforgettable crowd in Oakland. Dallas won 65 games that year and became the only 65-win team to ever not advance past the first round; the Mavs won Game 5 to prolong the series, 118-112, then got blown out in Game 6, 111-86. Golden State lost to Utah in the next round, 4-1.\n\nHow often does the 1-8 series go to seven games?\n\nAside from the Pistons rallying back from a 3-1 deficit in 2003, it's only happened three other times, but two of those teams went on to win the championship.\n\nIn 2008, Boston defeated Atlanta in Game 7, 99-65, to cap a series in which the home team won every game. The Celtics went on to win the title.\n\nIn 2014, both 1-8 matchups went the full seven games. Eighth-seeded Atlanta took a 3-2 series lead on Indiana but ultimately lost at home in Game 6, 95-88, and then suffered a 92-80 loss to the Pacers in Game 7. Indiana went as far as the conference finals before falling to second-seeded Miami.\n\nThat same year, San Antonio was pushed to the limit against Dallas. The eighth-seeded Mavericks topped the Spurs in Game 6, 113-111, but San Antonio won easily in the deciding Game 7, 119-96. Ironically, San Antonio never saw another seven-game series on its way to the NBA title.\n\nIncluding the three times where a No. 1 seed lost to a No. 8, 12 first-round series have been settled in six games. That's a total of 16 first-round series going to six or seven games; so 60% of first-round series since the changeover in 2003 end in four or five games.\n\nMore:Here's the Bucks playoff roster\n\nMore:Milwaukee Bucks 2023 NBA playoff schedule for first-round series vs. Miami Heat", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2023/04/05/nba-playoff-picture-memphis-grizzlies-second-seed-seed/70078064007/", "title": "NBA playoff picture: Memphis Grizzlies lock up No. 2 seed, await ...", "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies are close to locking up the second seed in the West playoffs.\n\nDenver has the tiebreaker against Memphis, so any win by the Nuggets or loss by the Grizzlies will give Denver the top seed.

What now?", "text": "Even though the Milwaukee Bucks started the season 9-0, frustration set in early for the Bucks.\n\nSome of it was public, such as when Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo shoved a ladder in Philadelphia while he was trying to practice free throws after a loss to the 76ers. The Bucks were 11-4 at the time.\n\nSome of it was more private, such as the bristling among players about prickly Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. Some of that is natural in an 82-game season.\n\nAnd injuries that sidelined key players such as Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton disrupted portions of the season.\n\nWins resolve some of that. The Bucks had a 16-game winning streak from Jan. 23-March 1, and they finished with the NBA’s best record at 58-24 and claimed the top seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nThe Bucks’ season fizzled, ending with a stunning and disappointing series loss to the eighth-seeded Miami Heat, who finished the first-round series with a 128-126 overtime victory in Game 5 on Wednesday. It's just the sixth time in league history that an eight-seed has defeated a No. 1 seed, and the first time since Philadelphia defeated Chicago in 2012.\n\nFor the Bucks, it’s the second consecutive early exit after winning the championship in 2021. They lost to the Boston Celtics in last season’s conference semifinals and now the franchise faces a crucial offseason.\n\nHow did the Bucks lose this series?\n\nThe simple version of the Bucks’ demise against Miami: They ran into Jimmy Butler. Jimmy Buckets was phenomenal in this series, scoring at least 30 points in four of the five games, including 56 in Game 4 and 42 in Game 5.\n\nMiami was a poor shooting team during the regular season – No. 26 from the field and No. 27 on 3-pointers. The Heat found their shooting touch against Milwaukee, shooting better than 50% from the field and 45% on 3-pointers.\n\nThe Bucks wasted a 12-point fourth-quarter lead in Game 4 and squandered a 16-point fourth-quarter advantage and an eight-point lead in the final 3:18 of the fourth in Game 5. Milwaukee also made just 28-of-45 free throws, including 10-for-23 from Antetokounmpo, in the series finale.\n\nDo the Bucks blow up the roster?\n\nThe playoff shortcomings in 2022 and 2023 necessitate changes, but multiple league executives who talked to USA TODAY Sports under the condition of anonymity so they could talk freely made it clear: you don’t blow up a team with Antetokounmpo still in his prime.\n\nAntetokounmpo, 28, was bothered by injuries this season, including knee trouble and the bruised back that sidelined him in Game 2 and 3 against Miami.\n\nBut he still dominated, averaging a career-high 31.1 points, 11.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists and shooting 55.3% from the field in 63 regular-season games.\n\nHe is one of three finalists for MVP and will make All-NBA this season.\n\nAntetokounmpo produces at an elite level and remains a player who can lead a team to a championship. A team doesn’t get a player like Antetokounmpo often, and teams want to maximize championship windows because they don’t last forever.\n\nOwnership, including new Bucks partial owner Jimmy and Dee Haslam (also owners of the Cleveland Browns), understand that.\n\nWhat are the important roster decisions?\n\nGeneral manager Jon Horst has managed the roster with finesse, and the Bucks have the most regular-season victories in the NBA the past five seasons. He has had the benefit of spending money on salaries that put the Bucks in the luxury tax.\n\nThe Haslams provide an infusion of cash and have shown a willingness to spend on the Browns. The Bucks in all likelihood will be a luxury-tax paying team next season, too.\n\nAntetokounmpo is under contract for next season at $45.6 million and he is also extension-eligible in September. Holiday, Portis, Connaughton, Grayson Allen, Jevon Carter and MarJon Beauchamp are also under contract for 2023-24.\n\nBrook Lopez, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles and Wesley Matthews are key players who are free agents.\n\nThe two big question marks are Lopez and Middleton, who has a $40.3 million player option on the final year of his deal in 2023-24.\n\nLopez is 35 but had a tremendous season. He was a finalist for Defensive Player of the Year, will be an All-Defensive team selection and is versatile offensively. If the Bucks lose Lopez, they’re not as good.\n\nComing off a knee injury last season, Middleton played in just 33 games this season. His minutes per game dropped and his 3-point shooting percentage fell by nearly six percentage points season over season.\n\nIt’s difficult to turn down $40 million per season, but Middleton could decline his player option and re-sign for less money per season but more years on the deal with Milwaukee or another team. A sign-and-trade is possible, but any move involving a key player seemingly would require Antetokounmpo’s approval.\n\nRegardless, Middleton has been an important part of Milwaukee’s high-level success, and he’s not easily replaceable.\n\nHorst will also try to improve on the fringes.\n\nWill Coach Mike Budenholzer return?\n\nRumblings about Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer’s demise have existed for a few seasons. There is belief among league execs USA TODAY Sports spoke with under the condition of anonymity who believe Budenholzer’s job is in danger after losing in the first round with the best regular-season team in the league.\n\nChampionship coaches don’t stick around forever. The Toronto Raptors just dismissed Nick Nurse, who led the Raptors to the 2019 title, and last offseason, the Los Angeles Lakers fired Frank Vogel, who coached the Lakers to the 2020 title.\n\nThere are just three current coaches who have been with the same team for at least the past 10 seasons. Coaches wear out their welcome eventually.\n\nBut there’s another side to the Bucks’ situation: Which available coach is better?\n\nBudenholzer is one of the top coaches in the league (Coach of the Year in 2015). Like any coach, he has flaws, but he knows Xs and Os, has a definitive philosophy on how he wants to play and gets player buy-in.\n\nWhatever the Bucks do – keep Budenholzer or fire him, run it back or make massive changes – alienating Antetokounmpo is not an option.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}]}

The intense military clashes are creating a growing humanitarian crisis and have forced foreign nations, including the U.S., to evacuate their embassies.\n\nThe fighting is between two rival generals: Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, who leads the Sudanese military, and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group. Caught in between are millions of civilians who have made their support for a democratic government clear.\n\n“This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. It’s unconscionable and it must stop,” President Joe Biden said a statement after the violence broke out.\n\nAs fears over civil war mount, here’s what you should know about the conflict.\n\nWhere is Sudan?\n\nSudan is a country in Northeast Africa bordering the Red Sea. With a population of about 45 million, it is one of the continent’s most populous nations and largest geographically.\n\nAs the death count rises, thousands are fleeing the embattled region to neighboring nations including South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia and Egypt.\n\nHow US embassy was evacuated in Sudan:A visual guide to the evacuation by SEAL Team 6 in Khartoum\n\nUS sanctions on SudanPresident Biden's new executive order could result in new US sanctions to Sudan. Why now?\n\nWhy is Sudan at war?\n\nThe conflict represents a power struggle between two Sudanese generals: Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.\n\nBurhan leads the Sudanese military, the country's official army, while Dagalo heads up the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group that is vying for more power in the government.\n\nThe two generals have been sharing power since 2021 when they carried out a military coup. Prior to that Burhan had been leading alongside a civilian prime minister who rose to the government's seat after a revolution ousted the nation's dictator, Omar al-Bashir, in 2019.\n\nThe conflict, which has claimed over 500 lives and injured nearly 5,000, erupted as the nation was poised to transition fully to democratic power. That transition presented a threat to military forces, whose own power would have been diluted, the New York Times reports.\n\nWhile mediators hoped for a smooth transition, the bitter rivalry exploded in gunfire on April 15 and has continued despite efforts from other nations to calm the tensions. A number of shaky ceasefires have been brokered by the U.S. and other nearby countries in hopes of saving lives and allowing safe evacuations, though they have no been strictly heeded.\n\nUS embassy evacuated in Sudan\n\nThe United States evacuated the embassy in the capital of Khartoum on April 22, prompting a scramble from other nations to follow suit.\n\nElements of the elite Naval squad SEAL Team Six and the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group assisted with the mission, which lifted 70 staffers by helicopter to a nearby military base in Djibouti.\n\nAre there new Sudan sanctions?\n\nIn early May, Biden announced he would take steps to sanction those involved in Sudan's recent violence.\n\nSigning an executive order on Thursday, May 4, the president issued a statement saying the move would “hold individuals responsible for threatening the peace, security, and stability of Sudan; undermining Sudan’s democratic transition; using violence against civilians; or committing serious human rights abuses.”\n\nThe order does not mean sanctions have been officially issued, it merely grants authority and asks the Treasury Department and other agencies to take a look at whether it would be appropriate, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby clarified.\n\nWhy are so many Americans in Sudan?\n\nAbout 16,000 private American citizens are in Sudan, authorities say. Most are either aid workers or Sudanese Americans, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said.\n\nThe US began evacuating hundreds of American citizens in late April. Evacuees took a dangerous land-path, escorted by armed drones to the Port of Sudan, where they were able to board ships traveling to Jeddah, a city in Saudi Arabia across the Red Sea.\n\nAmerican families in Sudan had previously criticized the U.S. government for what they perceived as a lack of action in orchestrating a manned evacuation. No U.S. military personnel was on the ground in Sudan to assist with the convoy.\n\nHow to help Sudan?\n\nThe continued fighting in Sudan poses a humanitarian risk for residents who were already experiencing food insecurity from severe weather.\n\nCivilians facing threat of violence are also less free to leave their homes to acquire essentials such as food, water and medicine.\n\nA number of organizations are working to help with ongoing issues in Sudan:\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-zelensky-evacuation-intl/index.html", "title": "Zelensky defiant: Ukrainian president refuses US offer to evacuate ...", "text": "1.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/military/2021/08/17/jacksonville-veterans-disheartened-taliban-takeover-afghanistan/8147596002/", "title": "Jacksonville veterans disheartened by Taliban takeover of Afghanistan", "text": "As the Taliban has taken over Afghanistan with the United States backing out, Jacksonville veterans are sounding off at what has happened there.\n\nRetired U.S. Marine Corps Col.

Now his agency helps returning soldiers and sailors ages 22 to 55 suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and related mental health issues,\n\n\"I'm surprised that the current administration made such a decision to pull everybody out, and the way that it was conducted, which was in a very clandestine manner,\" Loving said. \"I just can't believe that Afghan leadership did not know that we would be pulling our forces out. The current president of Afghanistan has already fled the country along with the rest of its supposed leadership.\"\n\nArmed Taliban fighters took over key parts of the capital city of Kabul on Sunday after overrunning many other major Afghan cities last week.\n\nThe rebel takeover came as a frenzied exodus of Afghan citizens, many who have helped American forces, try to flee their homeland after the United States ended its 20-year-old campaign to bring peace and prosperity there. Some died as they tried to board departing planes Monday.\n\nIt is \"incomprehensible\" that U.S. officials could not have predicted the sudden demise of the Afghan government after the military began leaving, said Nancy Soderberg, former White House deputy national security adviser and United Nations ambassador. The Jacksonville Beach resident said she does not understand \"what the rush\" was to get the U.S. military and intelligence officers out after 20 years of working with them.\n\n\"When we invaded Iraq, we took our eye off the ball and never really did the deep building of a more stable democracy that we might have done. We will never know,\" Soderberg said. \"It is just one tragedy after another if you look at the history of this 20-year conflict.\"\n\nMore: Shaped by war, veterans tell their stories through art as St. Aug exhibit continues\n\nMore: Refugee resettlement and aid agencies prepare for an increase in new arrivals\n\nMichael Fleming, a retired Florida Army National Guard general who helped Jacksonville University develop its veteran resource center, said it has been \"difficult to watch\" for many veterans and their families. As outreach director at Jacksonville's Steven A. Cohen Family Clinic at Centerstone, which helps military families and veterans deal with trauma, he said many Afghanistan veterans are feeling \"disappointment, sadness and even anger\" over the images of the U.S. departure.\n\n\"Their emotions are going to be very difficult to process and they will start wondering, was it worth it? Why was my son over there, my husband, my wife or daughter over there?\" Fleming said. \"For me as a veteran, my main concern is really the mental health of the individuals who served over there and the family and community members affected by that.\"\n\nThe United States and NATO spent two decades working to build up Afghan security forces after a U.S.-led invasion pushed the Taliban out following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump signed a deal in February 2020 that limited direct military action against the insurgents. Then with about 3,000 U.S. troops left in Afghanistan, new President Joe Biden ordered a withdrawal a few months ago, leaving about 650 to handle embassy and airport security.\n\nAs U.S. troops departed in advance of a Sept. 11 deadline, the Taliban quickly advanced last week and the U.S. Embassy suspended operations.\n\nIn an April YouTube video in response to the phased withdrawal, Wounded Warrior Project CEO Mike Linnington said it was hard to believe the United States has been at war for almost 20 years. And as the chaos in Afghanistan grew in the past week, Wounded Warrior spokeswoman Sherry Sandeford said no one at the Jacksonville-based agency wanted to comment yet. But she issued a statement about how the agency is available to help any veteran if battlefront memories surface.\n\n\"We understand these developments bring back some difficult memories from warriors’ military experiences, and we are here for them,\" she said. \"The mission of Wounded Warrior Project has not changed ... For us, it’s about the warrior.\"\n\nA comparison to Vietnam\n\nLoving said he believes the United States and its military did what it wanted to do after 9/11, getting rid of the terrorist threat. But after spending multiple tours in Vietnam in the 1960s, he wondered what the country accomplished in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I don't know why this country seems to have some reason where we want to nation build whenever we do anything, then ... it becomes a failure and we walk away from it, and I think that is what we did in Afghanistan this time,\" he said. \"It was very similar to what happened in Vietnam.\"\n\nMany have compared America's hasty evacuation of Kabul and the U.S. Embassy there to the April 1975 escape by embassy staff as Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese and the Vietnam War ended.\n\nBack then, President Gerald Ford ordered evacuations, but military planes could not land as North Vietnamese troops awaited them and thousands of refugees clogged the runway. Finally, dozens of American helicopters landed at the embassy and an apartment complex roof nearby, evacuating thousands of U.S. government employees and their Vietnamese staff to American ships offshore.\n\nAs images of Afghan refugees swarming U.S. planes trying to leave the country were seen from Kabul's airport on Monday, Loving said it looks like the police and soldiers the U.S. trained there have done nothing to stop the Taliban's advance.\n\nMore: PTSD’s war toll: Buddy system helps veterans battle demons\n\nMore: ‘Father of the wall’ looks back on his dream as Jacksonville monument turns 15\n\n\"There's so many Afghan people on the runway, and the planes can't take off,\" Loving said. \"... We started nation building and we supposedly trained their forces to be able to defend themselves, but obviously that's not happening right now. And the Taliban are paying the Afghan military to join them.\"\n\nSoderberg pointed out there are U.S. troops in Germany, Korea and \"all over the world\" to help keep the peace, including two decades of presence in Kosovo.\n\n\"The question now is what was the rush to get them out without doing the due diligence that was so essential. There are so many questions left that we have,\" she said. \"... It's not just the people being evacuated, our military and intelligence commanders who have been in this for 20 years — how could they miss this. It is just inconceivable.\"\n\nAlong with them, there is concern for the safety of the Afghan women and children who will have to live under strict Taliban rule, Soderberg said.\n\n\"How can we protect them,\" she said. \"... We just have to make sure the international community tries to protect the women and girls. It is absolutely depressing and tragic.\"\n\nLoving also points to all the military equipment, from drones and Humvees to missiles, that have been confiscated by the Taliban as the U.S. military left.\n\ndscanlan@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4549", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/world/gallery/ukraine-russia-crisis/index.html", "title": "Photos: Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Cars burn after a Russian military strike in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on October 10.

On Monday, Germany pulled out its embassy staff in Tripoli.\n\nOther western countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and France urged their citizens to leave Libya.\n\nIn 2012, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack in Benghazi — Libya's second-largest city.\n\nLibya has been plagued with factional fighting since the United States and NATO launched air operations to oust Gadhafi. In the past year, that violence has escalated in the absence of a strong federal government and united military that could keep control over the security situation and bring the various militias and other factions together.\n\nSome expect the fighting to escalate, because a militia made up of the ethnic Tubu tribe in the city of Murzuk, which answers to the Libyan Military of Defense, is threatening to intervene if the attack continues.\n\n\"All revolutionary brigades and army units in the south are ready to intervene militarily to protect the airport and enforce peace at all costs,\" said Barka Wardougou, who heads the military council in Murzuk in southern Libya, a stronghold of the Tubu, and supports the Zintanis. \"I warn the militias who are carrying out an assault on Tripoli International Airport and deliberately destroying the national properties that we will not stand aside and watch in silence.

Over the weekend, 32 people were killed and 62 wounded, the ministry said.\n\nSome residents said the situation reminds them of the early 1990s, when the United Nations imposed sanctions to pressure Libya into handing over those suspected of being involved in the 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Then, it was difficult to fly out of Libya.\n\n\"We are back to the period of embargo in the beginning of the 1990s,\" said Nabil Suleiman, chairman of a Libyan association of entrepreneurs, about the closure of the airport. \"I remember I used to travel in the cargo boats with my goods to Malta.

It was, he says, the furthest-forward Ukrainian-held position in Irpin, a suburb on the outskirts of Kyiv, as Russian forces tried to push on through to seize the capital.\n\nThe once-affluent suburb is now synonymous with alleged Russian war crimes – a pilgrimage site for visiting dignitaries who’ve beaten a path to its shell-scarred streets. Kevin says he and his men were among the first to witness attacks on Ukrainian civilians here.\n\nDespite a former career as a top-level US counter-terrorism operative, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kevin says it is here in Ukraine that he has faced the most intense fighting of his life.\n\nHe says he and his new comrades-in-arms have implemented many of the guerrilla tactics that were used against the American military in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. They are the insurgents now.\n\n“Everything is much more decentralized,” he explains. “Small group tactics is definitely a huge advantage here.”\n\nWe are not using Kevin’s full name because of the nature of his work in Ukraine.\n\n“Being on this side now, and hearing their conversations on their radio – and them knowing, okay, they’re out there somewhere, we don’t know where or who it is – there’s definitely an advantage to that,” he says.\n\n‘Real combat experience’\n\nLike many military veterans, Kevin says he had felt adrift since originally leaving the battlefield several years ago. He had a full-time job in the US, but quit when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky put out a call for experienced foreign fighters at the beginning of the war. He arrived in western Ukraine, was driven to Kyiv, and was on the frontlines of the battle for the capital within a matter of hours.\n\nHe joined Ukraine’s International Legion, launched by the government in the first days of the war. The government pays him and his colleagues a modest salary of between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, though Kevin says they have spent far more than that buying equipment. The International Legion even got its own website, instructing would-be foreign recruits on everything from how to contact the Ukrainian embassy to what to pack.\n\nIn those first weeks, the government struggled to weed out the pretenders and war tourists who were out of their depth. By March 6, they had received more than 20,000 applications, according to the foreign minister.\n\nThe number of foreign fighters now in Ukraine is a state secret, but a spokesperson for the International Legion told CNN that the “symbiosis” means Ukraine’s “chances of winning are greatly increased.”\n\n“The best of the best join the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Colonel Anton Myronovych told CNN. “These are foreigners with real combat experience, these are foreign citizens who know what war is, know how to handle weapons, know how to destroy the enemy.”\n\nFor the first time in his life, Kevin was defending against invasion by a better-equipped enemy. He, not the enemy, was the one who had to worry about airstrikes. There was no master plan, no air support – and there would be no evacuation in case of disaster.\n\n“It was like a movie,” he says. “It was insanity from the start. We started taking indirect fire driving in – small arms fire driving in. And I was in a pickup truck, just driving down the street.”\n\n“There’s tanks, and above us there’s helicopters. And you can hear the Russian jets flying by. And out in the open fields the Russians were dropping troops off in helicopters. And so you’re like: ‘Woah, wow!’ It’s a lot.”\n\nKevin and his colleagues were on the receiving end of artillery fire. During battles in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria, these foreign soldiers were calling in the air strikes and artillery bombardments. They’d never known was it was like on the receiving end.\n\nKevin says that, faced with the reality of battle, many foreign fighters decided to leave. “That’s when they say, ‘Maybe this isn’t for me.’ The first time that round comes in within 20 meters is the first time you’re like, ‘Oh, sh*t,’” he said.\n\nDay after day, Kevin and his buddies concluded that they, too, had had enough. Then the next day came, bringing with it new orders and new missions, and they found themselves staying on. Eventually, he says, they wound up at the sauna and gym complex where they holed up for four days, even as the building slowly disintegrated under Russian shelling.\n\n“We call it the house of horrors, because it was literally a nightmare in there,” he says. “This was four really miserable days of really little sleep, really heavy artillery, really heavy infantry presence from the Russians. No matter how many people that we removed from their side, they just kept coming.”\n\nHe and the other foreigners on his team were “shocked,” he says. “But the Ukrainian military was … calm, cool, collected. As they say, like, ‘This is normal, don’t worry about it.’”\n\nHe is in awe of the Ukrainian soldiers’ efforts.\n\n“They are masters of terrain denial,” he says. “They know every inch of the area. They know the little alleyway that we can wait. They know how to get there. They know this is where we can hide. They know which building to go to. And they’ll tell you before we get there, hey, five houses over has a real nice basement. That’s where we should go.”\n\n‘Everything was on fire’\n\nKevin walks through what remains of the building, which was ravaged by fire. In the gym, barbells have warped under the extreme heat. Rubber has melted off weight plates.\n\n“This was a chair,” he says, pointing to a metal frame. “We were being artilleried so heavy that we put this chair here so that we could jump out this window if we had to in a hurry.”\n\nWhen a sheet of loose corrugated roofing slams in the wind outside, he jumps.\n\nAt one point during the standoff, he says, Russian troops were so close that, lying on the floor in the pitch-black night, he could hear glass crunching under the enemy’s feet.\n\nAnd yet, he is sure he made the right decision to come to Ukraine.\n\n“It became more and more self-evident for us that this was the right thing,” he says. “Everything was on fire. The artillery was nonstop. We’d already seen civilians just outright murdered.”\n\nHe agrees that there was moral ambiguity to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n“It really comes down to good versus evil,” he says. “You’ll hear the Ukrainians call the Russians ‘Orcs.’ It’s because to them, it’s a symbol of good versus evil, like in Lord of the Rings – the light versus the dark,” he said.\n\n“The Russians, they know exactly what they’re doing. They have education. They have social media, news,” he says. “I never figured out why they were killing women and children. And it wasn’t by accident. It was murder. We found many people just at the end of the street who were bound together, shot, thrown on the side of the road, ran over by tanks. Just barbaric. For what reason?”\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, is investigating thousands of cases of alleged Russian war crimes across the country, and the top war crimes prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has traveled to Ukraine to investigate.\n\nKevin says he feels like he’s aged five years in the past three months. He doesn’t know how to explain what he’s experiencing here to his friends back home. He doesn’t know if he wants to.\n\nBut he knows that Ukraine “is where I should be,” and plans to stay in the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n“We’ve seen this play out time and time again in history. People ask me all the time, ‘Oh, this isn’t your fight.’ Or, ‘What are you doing over there?’ Yeah, but it wasn’t our fight many times in history. And then it was. It’s not your problem until it’s your problem.”", "authors": ["Mick Krever Sam Kiley", "Mick Krever", "Sam Kiley"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/language-meaning-ukraine-russia-invasion-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Language around Russia's invasion of Ukraine: DPR, LPR, shelling ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has devastated the country, killing hundreds of civilians, sparking a humanitarian disaster and resulting in a wave of sanctions from the West.\n\nFollowing the constant flow of developments can be confusing and overwhelming.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continues, here’s a guide to some of the terms you may have heard or seen: What they mean, and why they matter.\n\nDPR and LPR\n\nThese are acronyms for two pro-Russian separatist-held regions in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine: the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR).\n\nThe breakaway territories have been the site of a low-intensity war since 2014, when Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings across the region. The eight-year conflict has left more than 14,000 people dead.\n\nKyiv and the West insist that the self-declared republics are part of Ukraine, although the Ukrainian government asserts that the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied, and refuses to talk directly with either the DPR or LPR.\n\nOn February 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of the separatist territories, and ordered his troops into the region on what the Kremlin called a “peacekeeping” operation.\n\nThe move was widely seen by the West as the opening salvo of a larger military operation targeting Ukraine. Three days later, Russian forces invaded the country.\n\nShelling\n\nRussia has relied heavily on shelling key Ukrainian cities and towns as it seeks to seize control of locations in the country.\n\nShelling refers to artillery fire from large guns, and has been used against administrative and residential buildings. Dozens of deaths as a result of Russian shelling have been reported by Ukrainian emergency services.\n\nUnited Nations officials say more than 500 civilians have died since the invasion, from all causes including air strikes and shelling – though they caution that the true number is likely to be far higher.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russian forces of shelling indiscriminately since the invasion began. In a message on his Facebook page last Friday, he said Russian troops have been “shelling our people, our children, residential neighborhoods, churches, schools, destroying everything that provides a normal life, human life.”\n\n‘Humanitarian corridors’\n\nHumanitarian corridors are demilitarized pathways out of or into fighting zones during a war, which allow people to flee conflict or allow aid to be brought in. They are intended to reduce civilian casualties.\n\nUkraine has called on global leaders to pressure Putin to open such corridors and “prevent a large scale humanitarian catastrophe” in Ukrainian cities.\n\nBut the “humanitarian corridors” being discussed by Russian officials in the Ukraine conflict largely do not meet this description. Ukrainian officials rejected one unilateral Kremlin proposal for evacuation corridors for civilians as an unacceptable non-starter – since most of the routes lead to Russia or its staunch ally Belarus, and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting.\n\nA man carries a woman as they cross an improvised path to flee the town of Irpin, near Kyiv. Oleksandr Ratushniak/AP\n\nIn recent days, hopes for opening up safe evacuation corridors for civilians out of a number of cities have been repeatedly dashed, with Ukraine accusing Russia of attacking escape routes.\n\n“Evacuation through humanitarian corridors is only possible when the ceasefire regime is fully upheld. The Ukrainian side is ready for that,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a defense alliance of 30 North American and European nations. According to NATO, its purpose “is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means.”\n\nThe group was created in 1949, as the Cold War escalated. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet nations have joined NATO, to the frustration of Putin, who sees it as a threat. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but has long hoped to join the alliance – something Russia vehemently opposes.\n\nThe best-known aspect of the NATO alliance is Article 5 of its treaty, which states that “an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies.”\n\nSince Ukraine is not part of NATO, the alliance is not compelled to protect the country in the same way it would if a NATO member nation was attacked; indeed, countries from the alliance have said they have no intention of sending their troops into Ukraine. But many of Ukraine’s neighbors are members, and if a Russian attack extended into one of those countries, Article 5 could trigger direct involvement from the US and other NATO members.\n\nAnd the alliance can take collective defense measures without invoking Article 5. It has done just that in recent weeks, increasing land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank; Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has also asked for a more permanent NATO deployment in the Baltics.\n\nNo-fly zone\n\nA no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of this invasion, it would likely mean a zone where Russian planes are not allowed to fly, in order to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes on Ukraine.\n\nZelensky has urged NATO to institute a no-fly zone, but NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that it is not an option being considered by the alliance.\n\nIf it imposed a no-fly zone over Ukraine, NATO would likely have to step in to enforce it, at the risk of escalating the conflict.\n\nNATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including in Bosnia and Libya, but doing so is always a controversial move because it means getting involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces.\n\nPutin has said that any countries imposing a no-fly zone will be considered as participants in the armed conflict. If NATO were to do this over Ukraine, it could lead Russia to retaliate against NATO member states.\n\nJavelins and Stingers\n\nThe US and other Western nations have been sending key military equipment to Ukraine to assist in its fight against Russia. These include portable anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers, which are launched by soldiers on the ground to bring down aircraft flying overhead. They allow troops on foot to engage in the battle for Ukraine’s skies.\n\nPortable anti-tank weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles, are also being sent to Ukrainian forces. Also launched by ground troops, these target heavy-duty military vehicles including tanks, and work to slow and disrupt Russian military convoys as they move towards key locations.\n\nThe US and NATO have so far sent Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a senior US official told CNN on Monday.\n\nThere are different generations of Stingers that the US produces and US officials have been cognizant of not providing the newest model to the Ukrainians in case they fall into the hands of Russia, which could steal the US technology.\n\nCluster and ‘vacuum’ bombs\n\nNATO’s Stoltenberg has accused Russia of using cluster bombs as part of its attacks on Ukrainian cities. These are bombs that not only deliver an initial explosion on impact, but also contain multiple smaller bombs that spread over a wide area. They are largely condemned by the international community due to the risk of civilian casualties when they are used in populated areas.\n\nUS President Joe Biden’s envoy to the United Nations has separately accused Russia of preparing to use banned weapons, including “cluster munitions and vacuum bombs,” in Ukraine.\n\n“Vacuum bombs,” or thermobaric weapons, suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nRussia previously used thermobaric weapons in Chechnya with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher near the border with Ukraine in late February.\n\nWar crimes\n\nThe Geneva Convention, signed in 1949 in the wake of World War II, establishes global standards that must be observed during warfare.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, can prosecute grave breaches of those standards; it has specific definitions for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.\n\nThe ICC has already launched an active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, including targeting civilian populations, violating the Geneva Convention and targeting specific groups of people.\n\nThe US Embassy in Kyiv alleged on Friday that Russia had committed a war crime by attacking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine – the largest in Europe. “It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant,” the embassy said on its official Twitter feed. “Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.”\n\nSanctions\n\nSanctions are economic penalties applied by one country against another, or against specific companies or people. Western nations have imposed a stream of tough sanctions on Russia that have stunned its economy since Moscow invaded Ukraine.\n\nMeasures imposed on the country have included cutting off Russia’s two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB, from trading in US dollars and removing seven institutions from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial institutions and facilitates rapid and secure payments – essentially isolating Russian banks from the Western financial system.\n\nAs a result, the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, and of several Russian companies trading on foreign exchanges, has plummeted.\n\nKey individuals linked to the Kremlin have also been targeted, with Western nations moving to seize their properties or assets.\n\nSWIFT\n\nOf all the Western sanctions imposed Moscow so far, perhaps the most damaging is the removal of some Russian banks from SWIFT.\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was founded in 1973, replacing the telex, and is now used by more than 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders.\n\nSWIFT doesn’t move money around the world. What it does is allow banks to send each other instructions on how to transfer funds across borders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance.\n\nDisconnecting an entire country from SWIFT is considered the nuclear option of economic sanctions.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/03/europe/russia-ukraine-luhansk-lysychansk-intl/index.html", "title": "Lysychansk: Ukrainian forces withdraw from their last holdout in key ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia has taken control of Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that was still under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the military had taken over Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements on Sunday, according to the country’s Ministry of Defense.\n\nUkraine’s military announced Sunday that it had been “forced to withdraw” from the critical city.\n\nIn his nightly televised address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the retreat from Lysychansk was motivated to save the lives of Ukrainian troops.\n\n“We will rebuild the walls, we will win back the land, and people must be protected above all else,” he said.\n\nLuhansk is one of the two regions that form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014. The area has became the key centerpiece of Putin’s military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year.\n\nThe fall of Lysychansk shifts Russia closer to achieving the goal of taking over Donbas.\n\n“After heavy fighting for Lysychansk, the Defense Forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Sunday on Twitter.\n\nAccompanying the announcement was a photo that read: “Lysychansk: We’ll be back.”\n\nA Facebook post by the Ukrainian military also cited Russian superiority in weapons, ammunition and personnel in the battle for the city.\n\n“We continue the fight. Unfortunately, steel will and patriotism are not enough for success - material and technical resources are needed,” that post read.\n\nPro-Russia separatists in the area had already claimed a victory in the battle over Lysychansk.\n\nLeonid Pasechnik, the leader of the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), declared the Luhansk region “liberated.”\n\n“Today is the day we have accomplished what we all have been striving to for eight long years. Today our troops, with the support of the Russian armed forces, liberated the town of Lysychansk, thus completing the liberation of the Republic within its historic borders,” Pasechnik said.\n\nOnly Russia and Syria recognize the LPR as independent. Ukraine and its western allies consider it part of the Ukrainian territory, currently under Russian occupation.\n\nVideo shared by Russian state news outlet Ria Novosti on Saturday purports to show residents installing he old Soviet Union flag at the Memorial to the Memory of the Fallen in Lysychansk.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Russia will likely establish control over the remaining territory of Luhansk region in coming days. After that, the institute said in its latest update, Russian troops will likely focus on Ukrainian positions in Siversk, west of Lysychansk, before turning inland to Sloviansk and Bakhmut.\n\nThe Donetsk region military administration said Sunday that Russian forces continued shelling Slovyansk and Bakhmut.\n\nAt least six people have died and 15 were injured in Sloviansk on Sunday, according to Tetiana Tiurina, the head of the Public Information and Communication Department of Donetsk region.\n\nThe city of Kramatorsk was also hit with three missile strikes Sunday morning but there were no casualties, according to Ukraine’s Donetsk Regional Military Administration.\n\nZelensky said the cities of the Luhansk region were “the epicenter” of the hostilities. In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelensky acknowledged that more than 2,600 Ukrainian cities and towns were under Russian control.\n\n“The Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities,” Zelensky said, urging people to “help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time” and to use their contacts to “spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land.”\n\nA photo provided by Ukrainian authorities shows buildings that have been damaged in strikes on Lysychansk on July 3, 2022. Luhansk region military administration/AP\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine forces said they destroyed a Russian military base in the occupied Melitopol in southern Ukraine early Sunday morning, the city’s exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov said in a video address.\n\nMelitopol fell to Russian control in early March, weeks into the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Fedorov, Ukrainian troops filed “more than 30 shots exclusively at the military base,” rendering it “unable to function.”\n\n“Now the whole city is covered in smoke. This has been going on for three to four hours. Warehouses on the territory of the transport aviation base are burning,” Fedorov added.\n\nThe head of the Russia-installed council in the Zaporizhzhia region, Evgeny Balitsky, said in a Telegram post Sunday that “shells fell on the territory on the airfield” and that “there were no casualties.”\n\nRussian state news agency RIA Novosti also confirmed the attack, reporting that Ukraine had hit the Aviagorodok area of Melitopol, but did not specify what had been targeted.\n\nRussia and Belarus claim Ukrainian strikes against their territory\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also claimed on Sunday that the Ukrainian military launched “a deliberate strike” on residential areas of the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk.\n\nThe ministry’s spokesperson Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Ukrainian forces targeted the cities with Tochka-U ballistic missiles with cluster munitions and drones.\n\nHe said three ballistic missiles launched at Belgorod were destroyed by Russian air defense systems in the air, adding that the wreckage of one of the missiles fell on a residential building in the city.\n\nKonashenkov also claimed Russian air defense systems destroyed two Ukrainian military drones as they approached the city of Kursk, about 130 km (80 miles) north of Belgorod.\n\nCNN has been unable to independently confirm those claims and the Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the strikes.\n\nThe governor of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement posted on his Telegram channel that at least three people were killed, and dozens of residential buildings were damaged by explosions early on Sunday morning.\n\nSeparately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday accused Ukraine of launching a missile attack against military facilities on his country two days earlier.\n\nIn remarks published on the presidential website on Saturday, Lukashenko said Belarusian forces intercepted the missiles. However, he did not provide any evidence of Ukraine’s alleged attack.\n\nUkraine’s military did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims.\n\nLukashenko, Putin’s key ally in the region, said his country was being dragged into a war with Ukraine and claimed that “not a single Belarusian soldier is fighting on the territory of Ukraine.”\n\nRussian troops launched the invasion on February 24 into Ukraine from Belarus after months amassing manpower and material along Ukraine’s border.\n\nAccording to intelligence collected by NATO surveillance aircraft and CNN reporting, Belarus’ support for the Russian invasion includes air operations, in addition to ground support.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Yulia Kesaieva Hannah Ritchie Mariya Knight Radina Gigova Jonny Hallam", "Ivana Kottasová", "Yulia Kesaieva", "Hannah Ritchie", "Mariya Knight", "Radina Gigova", "Jonny Hallam"], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}]}

Here's ...", "text": "About 1 in 10 cases of COVID-19 nationwide is caused by an emerging coronavirus strain, XBB.1.16.\n\nThe World Health Organization has elevated this strain of omicron to one of two \"circulating variants of interest.\" The variant, which has been called Arcturus, is responsible for a growing share of coronavirus cases in the United States.\n\nAs of April 22, it caused 9.6% of COVID-19 infections nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nArcturus was first reported in January and has spread rapidly in other nations such as India and Indonesia.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow is Arcturus different from other coronavirus strains?\n\nInfectious disease doctors say the strain's mutation in the spike protein makes it highly transmissible but doesn't cause more severe cases. Existing vaccines and coronavirus treatments that work on omicron appear to work well against XBB.1.16, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBut Arcturus differs from earlier strains in at least two ways.\n\n\"It tends to produce more fever than some of the other strains we've seen,\" Schaffner said. \"But the most distinctive feature is that it seems to have a tendency to produce conjunctivitis, particularly in children.\"\n\nLessons from the COVID war:US should have attacked COVID like a foreign invasion, experts say\n\nAre your ears ringing? Experts are studying whether its linked to COVID or the vaccine.\n\nWhat is pink eye, aka conjunctivitis?\n\nConjunctivitis, known as pink eye, is an eye condition that can be caused by a virus, bacteria or allergies. Eyes turn red and swell and can produce a sticky discharge. It causes inflammation on the outer surface of the eyeball and eyelids.\n\nThe most common forms of pink eye spread easily from person to person.\n\nHow rare is COVID pink eye?\n\nAbout 1% to 3% of patients with COVID-19 have had pink eye as a symptom, the American Academy of Ophthalmology said, citing studies based on earlier strains.\n\nWhile there's no recent data about Arcturus and conjunctivitis, eye doctors and infectious disease specialists say there appears to be cases involving children though none could cite data showing how common these infections might be.\n\n\"Reports indicate that this is very much like other forms of viral conjunctivitis,\" Schaffner said. \"It'll make you miserable for about a week with swollen eyelids, tearing and itching, but then you recover without any long term effects.\"\n\nWhat does long COVID do to kids? What we've learned after a year of research.\n\nIs it pink eye or allergies?\n\nRed, itchy eyes also can be a sign of seasonal allergies. Allergies are common during the spring as pollen counts spike. If you are prone to allergies, you might consider reducing outdoor trips during spring months.\n\nDr. Ronald Benner, an optometrist and president of the American Optometric Association, recommended people see a doctor if they suspect an infection.\n\n\"It's hard to determine whether it originated from an allergy, or is it a bacterial infection or is it a viral infection?\" said Benner.\n\nSymptoms of COVID pink eye\n\nBenner said some people who have developed COVID pink eye might not notice any other symptoms.\n\n\"With this new variant of COVID, sometimes conjunctivitis is the only sign,\" Benner said.\n\nHe added that in rare instances COVID pink eye cases can linger for two to three weeks.\n\nDr. Jeff Pettey, an associate professor at the University of Utah Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, said COVID pink eye symptoms are similar to other pink eye viral infections.\n\n\"Symptoms can range from very mild to severe with eye pain and cloudy vision from cornea involvement,\" Pettey said. \"If someone has pink eye with other symptoms of COVID, they should test or seek medical care.\"\n\nWhile all types of pink eye cause the eyes to become red, other symptoms differ depending on the type of infection, Benner said. A bacterial infection tends to have a lot of discharge while allergies are more likely to cause itchiness and watering.\n\nMore: Long COVID has some weird symptoms. Face blindness may be one them.\n\nTreatments: What to do if you have pink eye\n\nBenner recommends people visit an eye doctor if the their eyes become inflamed or red and they have other symptoms such as discharge, itching or discomfort.\n\nDoctors will prescribe treatments based on the type of infection:\n\nBacterial pink eye is typically treated with eye drops containing antibiotics.\n\nEye drops can also alleviate the itchiness and puffiness cause by allergies.\n\nFor viral infections, a person might get comfort from a cool washcloth or artificial tears. Symptoms from most viral infections go away in seven to 10 days, Benner said.\n\nIf you suspect pink eye, Benner recommends being careful about personal hygiene:\n\nAvoid touching your eyes.\n\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water.\n\nDon't share personal items such as eye makeup with others.\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/04/28/arcturus-covid-19-variant-pink-eye-symptoms-how-treat/11758710002/", "title": "Arcturus COVID-19 variant: Pink eye symptoms, how to treat", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

First reported in January, the strain has rapidly spread in nations such as India and Indonesia. While Arcturus is similar to other variants, it does differ in a few key ways.\n\n►Extended Way Day: Save up to 80% with Wayfair deals on furniture, cookware and more\n\nArcturus COVID-19 symptoms\n\nAccording to infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner, Arcturus is associated with more fevers than previous strains. Its more distinctive trait, however, is its tendency to produce conjunctivitis, particularly when it infects children. Conjunctivitis, more commonly known as \"pink eye,\" can cause mild-to-severe eye irritation, cloudy vision and even discharge from the eye. Visually, it causes the sclera (the white of your eye) to appear pinkish-reddish, hence the common name.\n\nIf you need a refresher on the general symptoms of COVID-19, they are:\n\nFever or chills\n\nCough\n\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nFatigue\n\nMuscle or body aches\n\nHeadache\n\nNew loss of taste or smell\n\nSore throat\n\nCongestion or runny nose\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nHow common is Arcturus?\n\nAs of April 22, Arcturus represents 9.6% of new cases in America or 1 out of 10 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nHow contagious is Arcturus?\n\nAccording to experts such as infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner, Arcturus is highly transmissible due to mutations in its spike protein.\n\nIs Arcturus treatable?\n\nArcturus seems to respond well to the existing vaccines that treat omicron, as it's a strain of that particular variant. In terms of treatment, like other forms of coronavirus, your best bet is to treat the symptoms, though you may have to contend with the symptoms of pink eye with Arcturus. Consult your medical provider if your symptoms are concerning or to figure out the best plan for treating your symptoms.\n\n►Updated daily:The 10 best Amazon deals on Samsung, Vitamix and PlayStation\n\nHow to protect yourself from Arcturus\n\nA mask\n\nAirborne particles from infected individuals are the most common source of transmission for all known COVID-19 variants. Thus, the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to use a KN95 or N95 mask, named such because they block 95% of particulates, including those responsible for the spread of airborne diseases. As a bonus, they can also block out pollen, which may help minimize the effects of seasonal allergies this time of year.\n\nHand sanitizer\n\nWhile COVID-19 spreads predominantly through airborne particles, it can also spread by touching surfaces coated with infected droplets and then touching one's face. As such, it's recommended to wash your hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol.\n\nDisinfectant spray or wipes\n\nAnother way to avoid COVID-19 on dirty surfaces is by cleaning the surface itself. One way to do this is by using a disinfectant wipe or spray, both of which are effective in killing the coronavirus.\n\nAn at-home COVID-19 test\n\nIt can be hard to tell if you have COVID-19 or something else. With this new, pink eye-giving variant coming during a season when pink eye is typically more common because of seasonal allergies, it's even harder to figure out what you have. To take the guesswork out, we recommend using a take-home test to see where you stand.\n\nA thermometer\n\nWith this variant causing more fevers than others, it's a good idea to have a thermometer on hand as another way to figure out if you have COVID-19 or not. One of the best thermometers you can buy is the Femometer Digital Infrared Thermometer thanks to its features such as silent mode and a high-temperature warning.\n\nA washcloth\n\nOne remedy for the symptoms of pink eye, including eye pain and swelling, is to apply a moist washcloth to the affected eye. If you need a new washcloth (or a new bath set entirely), we recommend the washcloth that comes with our favorite bath towel. Parachute Classic's cotton towels are both comfortable and absorbent, the perfect combination for when you're nursing a hurting eye.\n\nEye drops\n\nEye drops are another way to relieve the symptoms of pink eye. Some of the best-rated eye drops for this purpose on Amazon are Similasan's pink eye relief eye drops. They have over 4,500 five-star ratings on Amazon, with buyers attesting to their effectiveness at clearing up pink eye and relieving its pain.\n\nA water bottle\n\nNo matter what sickness you're afflicted with, one of the best ways to help your body get over it is by making sure you're well-hydrated. To that end, you should make sure you have a quality water bottle on hand such as our favorite, the Brita BB11 Premium Filtering Water Bottle, which keeps water cool for up to 24 hours and filters out odors and taste.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

They are the first fatalities reported in April. If the number doesn’t grow, it will be the lowest month for COVID deaths in the more than three years of the pandemic.\n\nOnly 16 people with COVID were being treated in hospitals, according to the weekly report, and none of them was in intensive care. Dr. Uldine Castel, acting county health officer, said most of the infections that are emerging are causing less severe symptoms.\n\n“I think we’re in a good place,” said Castel, who is serving in the absence of vacationing Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin. “We’re seeing the result of the hard work of everyone wearing masks and the majority of people vaccinating.”\n\nAt Community Memorial Healthcare hospitals in Ventura and Ojai, one or two people with COVID symptoms come in each week, said Dr. Neil Canby, an emergency room physician. But two or three times a day, patients in the hospital for other procedures who don’t have any symptoms test positive for the virus.\n\nNearly all of the people who die from COVID now are older than 65 or have medical conditions that weaken their immunities, said Dr. George Yu, a Camarillo pulmonologist.\n\n“Anyone who dies from COVID right now is preventable,” Yu said, asserting too many high-risk people haven't received bivalent boosters that target Omicron variants and aren't asking for antiviral medications like Paxlovid after they test positive.\n\n“It’s head-scratching to me,” Yu said.\n\nIn Ventura County, demand for vaccinations has risen after U.S. Food & Drug Administration announcements that include allowing seniors to receive a second dose of the bivalent booster four months after their first shot. Immunocompromised people can receive a second shot two months after the first.\n\nNew variants continue to act as a wild card including a strain known as Arcturus that is causing about 10% of COVID-19 cases across the United States. It has been detected in Los Angeles County but has not been reported in Ventura County.\n\nDoctors said the variant is highly transmissible but doesn’t appear to cause more severe viruses. Its symptoms can include conjunctivitis, particularly in children.\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.\n\nTom Kisken covers health care and other news for the Ventura County Star.

There was a jump,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at Helix.\n\nLuo says she thinks a mix of factors – including waning immunity, broad spread and mutations to BA.5 that help it sneak past the body’s defenses – are probably all contributing to the increase.\n\nOn average, people who are getting reinfected now were last infected about nine months ago. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some recent cases in which people have gotten new bouts of Covid-19 just weeks apart. Luo can see those in the data. But they aren’t the norm.\n\n“Statistically speaking, you’re more likely to get reinfected the longer it has been since your last infection, just based on the data we’ve generated,” she said.\n\nThe Helix data echoes the results of a recent study on reinfection from Qatar, which routinely screens its 2.8 million residents for Covid-19, testing about 5% of the population each week.\n\nThe BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants arrived in Qatar in May and were dominating transmission by June.\n\nResearchers used the national screening data to look at instances of reinfection.\n\nThey found that people who’d had Covid-19 infections before the arrival of the Omicron variant had little protection against a reinfection that caused symptoms during the BA.5 wave: just 15%. But protection from a past infection by an Omicron variant was higher: about 76%.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Those who got infected with a pre-Omicron variant now have really limited protection against the infection of BA.4 or BA.5, so they cannot really count on natural immunity to protect them,” said Laith Abu-Raddad, an epidemiologist with Weill-Cornell Medicine-Qatar, in Doha, Qatar.\n\n“Those who get infected more recently with an Omicron variant, they have pretty good strong immunity – but of course not total immunity – against reinfection,” Abu-Raddad said.\n\nThese study results may not apply to everyone. The population of Qatar is unique because it is mostly made up of men who travel into the country for work, the researchers say, and few people there are over the age of 50.\n\nBut Luo says people shouldn’t panic when they hear about friends or family members getting Covid-19 for the second time in a month. “That’s not the typical experience.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/05/11/biden-ends-covid-public-health-emergency-how-to-protect-from-virus/70201114007/", "title": "Biden ends COVID public health emergency: How to protect from virus", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Subscribe to The Checklist newsletter for expert product advice and recommendations.\n\nWhy isn’t COVID-19 considered an emergency anymore?\n\nThe public health emergency comes to an end as COVID-19 cases continue to trend lower and lower. Last week, there were 77,294 weekly cases in the U.S. This is the lowest number of cases seen in a week since tracking began in early 2020. The week before that, there were 90,318 cases and 99,318 cases in the week before that.\n\nRelated:The latest COVID-19 variant, Arcturus, can cause pink eye—here's what to know and ways to avoid\n\nWays you can still protect from COVID-19\n\nWear a mask\n\nWearing a mask has become a fixture of public life in many places across the country. Even with COVID-19 no longer being an emergency, masks remain a great option for protecting those with compromised immune systems and curbing the spread of viruses in general. N95 and KN95 are the gold standard when it comes to masking, blocking 95% of airborne particles, including the ones that cause COVID-19. 95% of airborne particles, including the ones that COVID-19.\n\nWash your hands with soap\n\nNot only does COVID-19 spread via airborne particles, but also via surfaces. When you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your nose, mouth or eyes, you can get sick with COVID-19. One way to avoid this is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water. To properly wash your hands, lather the soap for 20 seconds (about the time it takes to sing the alphabet) and then rinse with warm-to-hot water, per the CDC. Softsoap has one of the best-rated hand soaps on Amazon. With over 57,000 five-star reviews, buyers love that the soap smells great and moisturizes their skin. Softsoap has one of the best-rated hand soaps on Amazon. With over 57,000 five-star reviews, buyers love that the soap smells great and moisturizes their skin.\n\nUse hand sanitizer\n\nNo soap? No water? No problem. You can use hand sanitizer as a substitute for washing your hands in a pinch or when you’re on the go. As long as the hand sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol, you’ll be able to kill the germs responsible for COVID-19.\n\nDisinfect your surroundings with wipes and spray\n\nInstead of disinfecting your hands after touching a contaminated surface, you can clean the surface itself. You have your choice of disinfectant spray or wipes, both of which can kill the virus and stop its spread. We recommend you disinfect widely used surfaces such as doorknobs, armrests and tables.\n\nPurify the air in your home\n\nAn air purifier can help curb the spread of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces, such as your home. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that using an air purifier can reduce the number of airborne contaminants in an area, including the ones responsible for COVID-19. If you’re looking for a new air purifier, we recommend the best one we've tested, the Blueair DustMagnet 5410i. It boasts exceptional particle removal, quiet operation and integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nMonitor your symptoms with a thermometer\n\nRunning a fever is one of the many symptoms of COVID-19. It’s particularly common in the Arcturus variant that’s rising in prominence. With this in mind, it’s helpful to keep a thermometer at hand. A great thermometer to have at your side is the Femometer Digital Infrared Thermometer thanks to its high-temperature warning.\n\nUse at-home COVID-19 tests\n\nHaving one or even a couple of common COVID-19 symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you’re sick with the coronavirus. That's why you should use a COVID-19 at-home test kit, which takes the guesswork out of determining if you're sick and gives you results in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nGet a resistance band for post-vaccine discomfort\n\nStaying up to date with your vaccinations is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While mild, getting the vaccine comes with its own slew of side effects. Fortunately, there are many remedies to ease these temporary side effects, including using a resistant band to work out any soreness in your arm. is one of the most effective ways to stave off the spread of COVID-19. While mild, getting the vaccine comes with its own slew of side effects. Fortunately, there are many remedies to ease these temporary side effects, including using a resistant band to work out any soreness in your arm.\n\nStay hydrated\n\nWhether you’re staving off sickness, recovering from getting sick or working through the side effects of vaccination, staying hydrated is vital in staying healthy and comfortable. If you need a new reusable water bottle, we recommend our favorite, the Brita BB11 Premium Filtering Water Bottle which keeps water cold, filters out odors and opens easily with one hand.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Recent research suggests that they escape immunity created by vaccines and past infections.\n\nAccording to the most recent updates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the genomics company Helix, BA.4 and BA.5 together accounted for an estimated 6% to 7% of new infections in the US in late May.\n\n“It’s a serious threat,” Dr. David Ho, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University in New York City, wrote in an email. “Only a month ago, it was .02 percent.”\n\nBA.4 has been detected in at least 30 countries, and BA.5 has been sampled in 32 countries, according to the website Outbreak.info, which is maintained by the Scripps Research Institute.\n\nHo and his co-authors recently tested antibodies from the blood of vaccinated and boosted people, as well as the antibodies of people who’d recovered from breakthrough Covid-19 infections, against engineered BA.4 and BA.5 viruses in the lab. In each case, they found a drop in potency against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nThey found that that BA.4 and BA.5 viruses are more than four times as likely to escape antibodies in people who’ve been vaccinated and boosted compared with BA.2 viruses.\n\nMore breakthrough infections\n\nAll of this means BA.4 and BA.5 are more likely to lead to breakthrough infections, even in people who’ve had Covid-19 before.\n\nWithout upgraded vaccines or boosters, Ho expects that a lot of Americans will get sick in the coming weeks to months. “I think we will see lots of infections but not necessarily more severe disease or deaths,” he said.\n\nHo’s research is posted as a preprint, which means it has not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in a medical journal.\n\nSouth Africa, which is ahead of the US in its BA.4/BA.5 cycle, has seen infections rise but has not seen a corresponding increase in deaths, said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at Helix.\n\n“So I think if we extrapolate from South Africa, what we’ll see in the US is that BA.4 and BA.5 will increase, because it has some competitive advantages compared to existing strains, but fingers crossed, it is not going to lead to more severe outcomes,” Luo said.\n\nOne question variant hunters have asked is whether BA.4 and BA.5 can outcompete BA.2.12.1, the highly contagious strain that’s currently the main cause of Covid-19 infections in the US.\n\nThese branches of the Omicron family tree rose to prominence about the same time; BA.2.12.1 quickly took over the US while BA.4 and BA.5 were establishing themselves in South Africa.\n\nThey share some similarities, including changes at location 452 of their genome, a genetic address known for helping variants escape our immunity.\n\nViruses square off\n\n“It’s like boxing,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the University of Washington’s clinical virology laboratory. “It’s like the national champion from South Africa going against the national champion in the United States.\n\n“You don’t know how to rank them if they haven’t ever fought,” he says.\n\nBut BA.4 and BA.5 have gone up against BA.2.12.1 in other parts of the world, like the UK. There, scientists found that the time it took the number of infections caused by a variant to double was about 5½ days for BA.2.12.1 and about a day less for BA.4 and BA.5, indicating that those viruses are spreading faster. The doubling times were included in a recent technical report from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\n“The betting favorite now suggests that BA.4 and BA.5 would be able to take out BA.2.12.1,” Greninger said.\n\nHo and his team think they may have figured out what’s giving BA.4 and BA.5 an extra edge.\n\nIn addition to all the changes in other Omicron variants that help them shrug off our vaccines, these viruses pulled off a F486V mutation. That’s a big change that helps disguise them from our immune system. In the past, it came with a downside: It made the virus’ spike less likely to be able to bind to our cells, so they were less competitive. But BA.4 and BA.5 have an additional mutation, called R493Q, that restores their ability to bind to cells, restoring their ability to infect us.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThough BA.4 and BA.5 seem capable of overpowering BA.2.12.1, they haven’t squared off in the US, and the fitness of these strains depends a lot on the playing field. The variants aren’t following a rulebook.\n\nBut for the next few months, experts say, there’s just going to be a lot of Covid-19 around us.\n\n“For the summer, going into the winter, I expect these viruses to be out there at relatively high levels,” Greninger said. “Just the number of cases, the sheer disruptions of the work force – It’s just a very high, high burden of disease.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/960465/sanofi-the-new-protein-based-covid-vaccine-to-be-used-in-the-uk", "title": "Sanofi: the new protein-based Covid vaccine to be used in the UK ...", "text": "The Sanofi vaccine, known as VidPrevtyn Beta , is protein-based and instead contains copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the beta variant. This variant was first detected in South Africa and was classified as a variant of concern in December 2020.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain mRNA, a small strand of genetic material that provides the instructions our cells need to make proteins. The mRNA instructs our cells to safely make copies of the spike protein which covers the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) and which helps it attach to and infect our cells. This trains our immune systems to recognise and kill SARS-CoV-2 if we encounter it.\n\nBut the Sanofi booster is based on a different vaccine technology, which hasn’t been used before in a Covid booster campaign in the UK. So what is it, and how effective is this shot?\n\nOver the past couple of years we’ve heard plenty about Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA-based vaccines . They’ve dominated the Covid vaccination campaign, particularly in high-income countries, with hundreds of millions of doses administered.\n\nThe Sanofi vaccine was approved for use in the UK and the EU at the end of 2022. It’s the seventh Covid vaccine to receive approval in the UK.\n\nDuring this vaccination campaign the UK will be using the updated bivalent vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (which target omicron alongside the original Covid strain) as well as another type of vaccine made by Sanofi.\n\nFor some this will be their sixth dose to date. But as immunity from Covid vaccines begins to wane in the months afterwards, this is a sensible precaution to help protect the most vulnerable against serious illness, hospitalisation and death should they contract the virus.\n\nIn the UK a spring booster campaign has recently begun, offering an additional vaccine to people at highest risk from Covid. Between April and June 2023 people aged over 75, residents in care homes and children and adults aged five and up with weakened immune systems will be invited to get their next shot.\n\nThe University of Edinburgh’s Neil Mabbott on the vaccine technology being used for Covid booster jabs from this month.\n\nSo rather than instructing our cells to make copies of the spike protein as the mRNA vaccines do, the Sanofi vaccine contains copies of the spike protein already. Although the method is different, it delivers much the same effect – training our immune systems to recognise and kill SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Sanofi vaccine also contains an extra ingredient called an adjuvant, which stimulates our immune system to improve the vaccine’s potency.\n\nThis type of vaccine design is not new. Several protein-based vaccines have been safely used for many years to provide immunity against the tetanus toxin as well as viral diseases such as hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, influenza and shingles.\n\nOther Covid vaccines have also used this approach, including one made by Novavax that was approved in the UK in February 2022. However, due to a number of reasons including delays in production compared to other manufacturers, the Novavax vaccine has not been used here.\n\nEfficacy and safety\n\nEarly results from phase 3 trials indicate that the Sanofi vaccine, when used as a booster, is effective in generating strong virus-killing neutralising antibody responses against different Covid variants, including omicron. We call this cross protection, and it’s important to help provide immunity against any future variants of concern.\n\nHow long the immunity from this vaccine may last is uncertain at this stage, but – in studies in animals – neutralising antibody responses to different variants were maintained for up to six months.\n\nNo serious adverse reactions or safety concerns have been reported in clinical trials. Side effects, if encountered, were generally mild to moderate and occurred within the first few days. These included headache, muscle and joint pains, fever, nausea and pain or swelling at the injection site.\n\nMixing and matching\n\nUsing different Covid vaccines at the same time will ensure sufficient stocks are available to complete the current booster campaign as quickly as possible.\n\nIf you’re worried about getting a different vaccine to the one you had last time, there’s no need. Mixing and matching the different types of vaccines used for the initial shots and subsequent boosters is known as heterologous vaccination. This has already been happening in the UK – many people will have had a mixture of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccinations over the past two years.\n\nHeterologous vaccination can actually strengthen and broaden the immune response generated by the vaccine, helping to provide cross protection against different variants. In future booster campaigns we’ll probably continue to see a range of different types of Covid vaccines offered.\n\nComparing the options\n\nThe simplicity of the mRNA vaccine technology has enabled these shots to be rapidly updated to deal with emerging variants such as omicron. Protein-based vaccines tend to take longer to manufacture.\n\nBut they can be much cheaper to produce and can be stored in a refrigerator, unlike the mRNA vaccines which need to be stored in a freezer. These are useful characteristics to help improve vaccine equity in low and middle-income countries where vaccination coverage remains patchy.\n\nMaking direct comparisons between different vaccines and their effectiveness is always difficult, but the Sanofi booster appears to perform well when compared against the mRNA vaccines.\n\nSo if you’re medically vulnerable and are offered a booster vaccination it’s important that you take up this opportunity. Whether you’re given a protein-based vaccine or an mRNA-based vaccine, each will provide a good boost to your immunity that will help to protect you against serious illness with Covid.\n\nNeil Mabbott, Personal Chair of Immunopathology, The University of Edinburgh\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Additionally, May 7th represented the lowest number of cases since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began tracking in early 2020.\n\nPrecautions you can still take to protect from COVID-19\n\nWear a mask\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we go about moving in public. Even if COVID-19 is no longer an emergency, if you or someone you're with is immuno-compromised, or if you're just health conscious in general, consider wearing a mask. It remains one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the coronavirus and others like the flu. N95 and KN95 are the most effective masks you can buy as they're designed to stop 95% of airborne particles, including the ones responsible for the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWash your hands with soap\n\nCOVID-19 typically spreads via airborne particles, but it can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your nose, mouth or eyes. Thus, another way to protect yourself is to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water, and do so often.

Both disinfectant wipes and spray will kill the virus and stop its spread. We recommend you disinfect widely used surfaces such as doorknobs, armrests, remote controls and tables.\n\nPurify the air in your home\n\nIf you're worried about the presence of COVID-19 in your home, one way you can curb its spread is by using a quality air purifier.

It is particularly prevalent with the most recent Arcturus variant that's becoming more common. Therefore, it's good to keep a thermometer handy, as it will help you determine whether or not you are sick.

Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nEuropean countries are seeing a significant increase in Covid-19 cases spurred by highly infectious subvariants of Omicron, raising fears of a new global wave of the disease as immunity declines and the summer travel season gets underway.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warned last week that “the growth advantage reported for BA.4 and BA.5 suggest that these variants will become dominant” throughout the European Union, and probably result in a surge in cases.\n\nInfections are rising in multiple countries, including Portugal, Germany, France, Greece, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and Spain, according to the Our World in Data (OWID) project at the University of Oxford, which tracks the pandemic.\n\nNew studies have shown that Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 have a growth advantage compared with earlier variants and appear to be good at evading the immune system. In other words, neither previous infections nor vaccines provide particularly strong protection against the subvariants, which is why they’re becoming the dominant strains. BA.4 and BA.5 do not appear to lead to more severe illness, but, as with previous waves, the increase in cases could result in an uptick in hospitalizations and deaths, the ECDC has said.\n\nTourists wearing face masks walk in Athens on June 1, when Greece dropped most of its Covid-19 restrictions. Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe potential impact of one of the subvariants, BA.5, is most apparent in Portugal, where it has fueled a significant rise in Covid-19 infections. That surge now appears to have plateaued, but is still higher than rates elsewhere. On Tuesday, the country registered a daily average of 1,332 new cases per million people over the previous seven days — the fifth-highest new case rate in the world. That compares with Germany’s 760 and France’s 747, according to OWID.\n\nThe number of people in hospital in Portugal, at 1,896, is nearly as high as it was during the original Omicron wave in January. BA.5 became the dominant strain in the country in May, not long after it was first detected in late March, according to Portugal’s National Institute of Health (INSA). By June 5, it accounted for 84% of all Covid infections there.\n\nIn France, the number of new cases per million people has nearly tripled since the beginning of the month, and hospitalizations are rising for the first time since the beginning of April. According to the public health agency Santé Publique France, in its most recent update, BA.5 rose to 24% of sequenced cases in the week of June 6, compared with 18% the week before.\n\nFrench vaccination chief Alain Fischer said on Wednesday that the question wasn’t whether the country was facing a new wave of the virus, but what intensity it might have, saying he was personally in favor of reinstating some restrictions to limit the spread.\n\n“The epidemic is accelerating again and it is completely unexpected in this season,” Dr. Benjamin Davido, an infectious disease specialist at the Raymond-Poincaré hospital outside Paris, told French radio on Sunday.\n\n“With the new Omicron subvariants (BA.4 and BA.5), which are 10% to 15% more contagious, the epidemic has found new energy, even though we have passed through the winter,” Davido said, adding that the lifting of almost all restrictions — like wearing masks on public transportation and airplanes — combined with unraveling immunity, posed a real threat.\n\nDavido and other health experts have warned that hospitals in France could fill up over the summer, unless vulnerable people and those over 60 get booster shots as soon as possible. But while hospital admissions in the country are on the rise, it’s not yet clear whether that’s down to the BA.5 subvariant being more transmissible or because it is escaping dwindling immunity.\n\nIn the UK, where cases and hospitalizations are rising sharply, the start of a new wave also appears to be driven by BA.4 and BA.5, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The latest data from the ONS, released on June 17, showed that Covid infections were up 43% week on week, according to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), a peer-reviewed medical trade journal.\n\nWriting in the BMJ, Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, said, “We will be the first (but not the last) major country to have a BA.4.5 wave after having had two previous Omicron waves. This means that we might get some additional protection from the high number of infections we had in March which will reduce the size of this coming wave. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of the country will get sick, especially as boosters are waning.”\n\nIt looks like the United States might not be far behind. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows BA.4 and BA.5 caused more than one in three Covid-19 infections in America last week. The subvariants are also expected to dominate transmissions in the US within the next few weeks.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: Will we ever know how the pandemic began?\n\nA: A team of international scientists tasked with understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic released its first report on Thursday, saying that all hypotheses remain on the table, including a possible laboratory incident.\n\n“The most common side effects from either of the vaccines are still the most common side effects we see from pretty much any child that gets any vaccine,” said Dr. Grant Paulsen, the principal site investigator for the Pfizer and the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials for kids from 6 months to 11 years old at Cincinnati Children’s hospital.\n\nThese include pain, swelling and/or redness at the injection site and fever. During the trials on the youngest children, myocarditis was not found to be a problem, but Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, assures that they will “have all the mechanisms in place once we start vaccinating kids” just in case.\n\nSend your questions here.

That’s my ultimate goal for my kid.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations for children younger than 5 began Tuesday across the United States, marking a milestone in the nation’s fight against the disease and making it the first country in the world to offer the shots for children as young as six months old. About 17 million kids under 5 are now eligible for vaccination.\n\nDr. Sarah Schaffer DeRoo described in one word how she felt after getting her 7-month-old son vaccinated against Covid-19: thrilled.\n\nHer active baby boy sat in her lap at a vaccine clinic hosted by Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, while receiving his first dose. The shot was administered in his thigh. He cried for a few seconds but then his attention turned to a golden retriever that was on site as a comfort dog provided by the hospital.\n\nThese children lost their young parents to Covid-19\n\nMore than 202,000 US children have lost one or both parents to Covid-19, according to estimates from Imperial College London, Holly Yan reports.\n\nLaila Dominguez, 13, has suffered from anxiety since her father’s death in January. When Covid-19 struck both her parents last winter and her father was hospitalized, she helped watch her two younger siblings and take care of her mother, who was severely sick.\n\nAt times, “it will get really, really dark. And sometimes it’s way too much for me,” Laila said. Her last experience taking care of her traumatized siblings led to a panic attack.\n\nLaila hopes more kids will learn from her story and take Covid-19 seriously, saying that to bullies who taunt her for still wearing a face mask, she bluntly answers: “My dad died.”\n\n“What I wish they knew about Covid is how dangerous it is … and be more aware of what they say.”\n\nMacao shuts most businesses as Covid cases surge, but casinos remain open\n\nThe world’s biggest gambling district began its second day of mass Covid-19 testing on Monday after dozens of cases were detected over the weekend.\n\nCity officials have begun closing schools, tourist attractions, cultural venues and all non-essential businesses. Restaurants have been ordered to suspend dine-in services.\n\nBut for casinos, it’s business as usual.\n\nMacao’s government relies on casinos for more than 80% of its income, with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the industry. While they remain open, analysts expect them to be hit as the government urges residents not to visit entertainment venues.\n\nThe testing of Macao’s roughly 600,000 residents is expected to end on Tuesday. The Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony adheres to China’s strict zero-Covid policy that aims to eradicate all outbreaks at just about any cost.\n\nSurviving 70 days in Shanghai – the ‘world’s strictest lockdown’\n\nWhen CNN producer Serenitie Wang left Covid-stricken Hong Kong in March, she was hoping to escape to safer pastures. Instead, she was just swapping the world’s biggest outbreak for the “world’s strictest lockdown” in Shanghai – and 70 days of enforced confinement.\n\n“Covid could seemingly pass between the floors and walls and the realization even the strongest measures couldn’t stop it was terrifying and shocking,” she writes about the spread of the virus in her parents’ 21-story residential housing compound, where she was staying.\n\nWhen she tested positive, she was taken to a “fangcang” – a public venue repurposed for people with Covid, where she was given a cot and a bag containing bedding, a basin and cup for washing, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a towel and slippers.\n\nShe was in a room with 3,000 strangers, each hoping for the negative test results that would secure their release – some remaining positive long after their symptoms disappeared. Everyone was trying to remain optimistic; meals were even delivered with encouraging fortune-cookie style messages attached.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nThe CDC also recommends testing within three days of your flight and not to travel if you are sick.\n\nSince the CDC recommended two Covid-19 vaccine options for children under 5 – one from Pfizer/BioNTech and another from Moderna – parents and caregivers may be wondering which one is right for their child.\n\nBut pediatricians CNN spoke with around the country suggest either is a good option. Their advice? Just get the vaccine that’s available.\n\n“I do not think it’s clear that one is any better than the other. They are different,” said Dr. Paulsen of Cincinnati Children’s. “It is very much what the parents prefer. Balancing those differences as well as, honestly, what’s available and what their pediatrician has or what the local hospital has.”\n\nDoctors also suggest looking online or calling to find out what the local site is offering. Not every location will offer both shots. Some clinics may also not be offering vaccinations for small children or may have restrictions on the ages they serve. Vaccines.gov may be helpful. The website provides some information on clinics listed by category.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR PODCAST\n\nIs it possible we’ve been going about conversation the wrong way our entire lives?

A study last year found that between 700,000 and 1.6 million people in the US had lost or had a change in their sense of smell for more than six months after having Covid.\n\nAnd the authors of the study – published in the Jama Network Open journal – warned that these figures were “likely an underestimate”, reported CNN.\n\nHowever, hopes have been raised after scientists said that a molecule found in coffee, typically described by people with smell distortion as “disgusting” or “repulsive”, could provide a breakthrough.\n\nThe causes\n\nThe “precise cause” of sensory loss related to the coronavirus is not known, said Sky News, but experts believe it is connected to “damage to infected cells in a part of the nose called the olfactory epithelium”. Cells in this area of the nasal cavity protect olfactory neurons that enable humans to smell.\n\nA study published in the Nature Genetics journal in January suggested that genetics plays a key role in determining whether a person loses or experiences a change in their sense of smell and taste after being infected with Covid-19.\n\nThe analysis of DNA data on nearly 70,000 adults in the UK and the US with Covid found that those with “certain genetic tweaks” on a chromosome near two olfactory genes, called UGT2A1 and UGT2A24, were 11% more likely to lose the ability to smell or taste than people without the changes, explained Science News.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the genetic variants “could affect how the two genes are turned on or off to somehow mess with smell during an infection”, the site said.\n\nTrigger molecule\n\nA related and lesser-known symptom of Covid is parosmia, where people experience smell distortion after contracting the virus. According to Fifth Sense, a charity for people affected by smell and taste disorders, an estimated 25,000 UK adults who have had Covid have been affected by parosmia, which “can mean food gives off an unpleasant odour or taste, such as rotten meat or chemicals”, said the BBC.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

A few seconds later, a black SUV carrying the guests of honor pulled up the White House driveway.\n\nThere was a 21-gun salute, a formal inspection of the troops, and the playing of each country's national anthems. Young children from the Korean-American Children’s Choir in New Jersey performed a traditional South Korean song. A fife and drum corps decked out in long red coats and white pants paraded in front of the stage.\n\n“What a beautiful day to invite great friends back to the White House,” Biden said, celebrating what he called “the ironclad alliance” between the two countries.\n\nThat alliance may have been “forged in blood,” Yoon said, speaking through an English translator, but it’s a “just” one that stands for “freedom, peace and prosperity around the world.”\n\n'Embarrassing wrench': How Pentagon leak complicates South Korean president's state visit with Biden\n\nHonoring American sacrifices in the Korean War\n\nThe night before the state visit officially began, the Bidens and their South Korean guests made a quiet pilgrimage to the Korean War Veterans’ Memorial on the National Mall.\n\nThe memorial, not far from the Lincoln Memorial, commemorates the sacrifices of the 5.8 million Americans who served in the U.S. armed services during the three-year Korean War. Some 54,246 Americans were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe Bidens and their guests strolled quietly through the memorial, which features 7-foot stainless steel statues of soldiers standing in patches of juniper bushes and polished granite strips symbolizing the rice paddies of Korea. They made no public remarks, but Yoon spoke of the visit during the White House arrival ceremony the next day.\n\n“Why did they sacrifice their lives for this faraway country and for the people they never met?” he asked of the Americans killed in the war. “That was for one noble cause: to defend freedom.”\n\nShow of force:US-South Korea military drills begin after North Korea submarine missile tests\n\nGifts for the South Korean guests\n\nWhen there’s a state visit, there are usually gifts.\n\nThe Bidens presented the South Koreans with a small, handcrafted table by an American furniture maker. Made of mahogany wood and inlaid with historical White House wood, the table was inspired by traditional Korean soban tables. The gift included a vase filled with handmade paper hibiscus and rose flowers by a Korean American artist and a brass plaque to commemorate the state visit.\n\nBiden also gave Yoon a shadow box set with custom and vintage baseball memorabilia. Jill Biden presented Kim with a pendant necklace with a trio of blue sapphires designed by a Korean American designer.\n\nFeting the French:Biden's first state dinner will honor French president. Here's what to know about the event\n\nNukes, cybersecurity and other serious business\n\nAmid the glitz and the glamour, Biden and Yoon conducted serious business, with bilateral meetings at the White House between the two leaders and other top officials from their delegations.\n\nBiden announced that he is increasing demonstrations of military might in the Indo-Pacific and expanding collaboration with South Korea in hopes of deterring an attack by North Korea. In exchange, Yoon reaffirmed his nation's commitment that it would not develop its own nuclear weapons.\n\nThe so-called Washington Declaration is the centerpiece of the new initiatives on cybersecurity, economic investments and more that the leaders rolled out during Yoon’s visit.\n\nA State Dinner with South Korean flair\n\nThe main event for every state visit is the dinner, the most coveted diplomatic honor – and one reserved for the U.S.'s closest allies.\n\nNaturally, this one had a decidedly Korean flair.\n\nSome 200 invited guests walked by a screen evoking traditional Korean ink brush painting. Dining tables were decked out with 6-foot-tall centerpieces of blossoming cherry tree boughs intended to suggest Washington's Tidal Basin in the springtime or the streets of Jeju. The menu featured braised beef short ribs – an American take on galbi-jjim – served with butter bean grits, sorghum-glazed carrots and pine nuts.\n\nAt the start of the soirée, Biden and Yoon toasted each other. Biden raised a glass \"to our partnership, to our people, to possibilities\" and added, \"May we do it together for another 170 years.\"\n\nYoon brought a smile to Biden's face by paying homage to his Irish roots. Speaking through an interpreter, Yoon quoted an old Irish saying that goes: \"A good friend is like a four-leaf clover. Hard to find and lucky to have.\"\n\nRecord launch:North Korea has launched at least 84 missiles in 2022, more than in any other year\n\nBroadway tunes and 'American Pie'\n\nBroadway performers provided the evening’s entertainment, but Yoon stole the show with an impromptu rendition of “American Pie.”\n\nSingers Lea Salonga, Jessica Vosk and Norm Lewis closed out the dinner with a selection of numbers from Broadway hit shows, including “Funny Girl” and “Les Misérables.\" For their encore, they chose the Don McLean classic “American Pie” especially for Yoon.\n\nWhen they finished, Jill Biden pushed Yoon onto the stage. “We know this is one of your favorite songs,” Joe Biden said.\n\nYoon, still speaking through a translator, confirmed that the song was one of his favorites when he was in school. After a bit of coaxing from Biden, Yoon took the microphone and belted out the first few stanzas – in English. The crowd gave him a standing ovation.\n\nBiden, who said he had no idea Yoon could sing, joked that he was going to tap the South Korean crooner to provide the entertainment for the next state dinner. Then, he surprised Yoon with another gift: A guitar signed by McLean.\n\nWho scored a coveted dinner invitation?\n\nThe Bidens and the guests of honor weren’t the evening's only big names. Prominent figures from the world of politics, business and entertainment scored an invitation to the state dinner.\n\nActress Angelina Jolie, decked out in a white dress, brought her son Maddox. Broadway performer Salonga, one of the night’s entertainers, admitted to being nervous but said the experience “feels like being in a fairytale.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre twirled for the photographers as she made her entrance. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York showed up in a navy suit instead of the usual formal attire. \"This is as tux-ey as I get,\" he said.\n\nSnowboarder Chloe Kim, an Olympic gold medalist, didn’t wear her medal. “I don’t know where it is,” she admitted. She was nervous, she said, but was looking forward to the dinner. \"The food's gonna be really good,” she predicted.\n\nThe dinner came a day after Biden announced his reelection bid, adding to the buzz around the dinner for his Democratic guests.\n\nMichael Purzycki, the mayor of Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, offered to assist with campaigning, \"Any way he wants me to.\"\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Wednesday's event is timed in part to celebrate this year's 70th anniversary of the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea.\n\nPlatinum, the traditional 70th anniversary color, was chosen for the linens featured throughout the cocktail reception.\n\nThe evening will conclude with the \"distinctly American\" entertainment of showtunes. Broadway stars Norm Lewis, Lea Salonga and Jessica Vosk will perform renditions of iconic songs, Biden said, \"showcasing the craft and creativity of our country.\"\n\nFor the menu, Biden said she tapped Lee because he creates dishes that are both familiar and surprising.\n\nBorn in New York City to parents who immigrated from Korea, Lee said Thanksgiving dinner was his family's favorite meal\n\n\"But being Korean, we always had to put soy sauce and kimchi and everything,\" he said. \"I've kept that spirit throughout my whole culinary career.\"\n\nThe former \"Top Chef\" competitor who owns restaurants in Louisville, Ky., and Washington, D.C., described the state dinner as \"a lot of pressure.\"\n\n\"The first person I called was my mother,\" he said. \"I've done dinners for thousands of people.

Yoon's visit has taken on new importance, however, as the Biden administration seeks to reassure its military partners America is not sloppy with its secrets.\n\nYoon is set to deliver a joint address to Congress while he is in Washington, in addition to meetings with Biden that will precede a formal state dinner.\n\n\"He has to come back with some deliverables, I think, from the United States,\" said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Mike McCaul. \"The little-kept secret is we do surveil our allies, and sometimes they surveil us, but it's just not made public.\"\n\nYoon appeared to downplay the kerfuffle, calling the U.S.-Korea alliance resilient. He also suggested for the first time that Seoul could arm Ukraine under certain conditions, the subject of the leaked documents.\n\n“I think it's certainly an unfortunate and an embarrassing wrench to throw into the situation immediately prior to a major summit,” Frank Aum, senior expert on Northeast Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said of the leak. “But I think both sides want to move on and put this issue behind them as quickly as possible.”\n\nPentagon document leak:Here are the biggest takeaways after U.S. military secrets leaked\n\nLeak suspect:Jack Teixeira, 21, appears in court over Pentagon leak. What charges is he facing?\n\nU.S. caught spying on South Korea\n\nLeaked intelligence indicates top advisers to Yoon were concerned ammunition South Korea agreed to sell the U.S. to refill its stockpiles would wind up in Ukraine. They also worried the state dinner, which was announced on March 7, would be perceived as a trade for lethal aid.\n\nSouth Korea does not send lethal weapons to countries at war, but the trove of documents — which U.S. officials have neither verified nor disavowed — suggested that Yoon's government was considering a policy shift.\n\nOpposition lawmakers in South Korea publicly chided the U.S. for the breach in trust. And the advisers to Yoon whom the intelligence identified as taking part in the discussion about lethal weapons recently stepped down.\n\nBut Yoon told Reuters last week it would be difficult for South Korea to stay on the sidelines of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “if there is a situation the international community cannot condone, such as any large-scale attack on civilians, massacre or serious violation of the laws of war.\"\n\nBiden's coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, John Kirby, told reporters last week that the U.S. had reached out to allies affected by the leak. Without detailing who was contacted or how they responded, Kirby said broadly that allies are being reassured about the U.S. commitment to safeguarding intelligence and to its security partnerships.\n\n“They have appreciated the seriousness with which we're taking this issue,” Kirby said. “Thus far, this regrettable exposure of classified material has not resulted in a breach of trust or confidence between us and our partners, or in our shared efforts to advance shared goals around the world.”\n\nLeak not likely to be publicly discussed\n\nBefore leaving for the U.S., Yoon was quoted by South Korean media as telling his cabinet that the two nations have a “resilient value-based alliance that can fully readjust even when their interests are in conflict or when there is trouble.”\n\nBased on that statement, Ellen Kim, an expert on U.S.-Korea relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Yoon probably won’t raise the issue publicly when he meets with Biden.\n\n“I expect that this issue will not be highlighted, even though the two leaders could discuss privately,” she said.\n\nOpposition lawmakers in South Korea have expressed outrage over the leak, though, and said that U.S. surveillance of the nation would undermine the relationship.\n\nThomas Cynkin, a former U.S. diplomat who advised two U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations on Asian affairs, said South Korean lawmakers decrying the spying are \"crying crocodile tears,\" given that their nation also wields a powerful spying agency.\n\n\"That isn't to say that some people wouldn't genuinely be offended, because in principle, they feel we're an ally,\" Cynkin said. \"But they know how this game works.\"\n\nThreats from North Korea, China top concerns\n\nCynkin said that much of the visit will be about demonstrating to Korean leadership that they are valued partners of the United States.\n\nThe summit, only the second time Biden has rolled out the full trappings of a state visit, comes as the nations are celebrating the 70th anniversary of their alliance.\n\n\"That's a big deal and shows that we're paying them a lot of attention,\" Cynkin said. \"The first thing is getting recognition of the importance of the relationship it symbolizes.\"\n\nExperts expect the two leaders to highlight efforts to deter North Korea’s aggression and announce cooperation on securing supply chains.\n\nYoon could walk away with an agreement on how U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China will affect South Korean companies that make semiconductors in China. Those companies are being prevented by China from relocating their plants. But the U.S. could restrict their ability to get spare parts or become too technologically sophisticated.\n\n“This is sort of a major issue in the U.S.-China relationship,” said Gregory Allen, a technologies expert at CSIS, “and, obviously, it’s now having major reverberations in the U.S.-South Korea relationship.”\n\nSouth Korea would also like greater reassurance that the U.S. can keep in check an increasingly bellicose North Korea. That could include ramped up military exercises, more strategic asset deployments to the Korean peninsula, or greater consultations on military planning, said Aum of the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\nBut there’s one problem. “It’s not clear,” Aum said, “that those measures actually deter North Korean provocations.”\n\nContributing: Michael Collins.\n\nFrancesca Chambers is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

We were even asked why Asians spoke in English,” the band said in a statement retweeted over 1 million times.\n\nThey continued, “We cannot put into words the pain of becoming the subject of hatred and violence for such a reason.”\n\nThe uptick in anti-Asian crime and hostility toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) comes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 10,000 hate incidents against AAPI persons were reported to advocacy organization Stop AAPI Hate between March 19, 2020, and December 31, 2021.\n\nBiden, the White House noted in a news release announcing the meeting, “has previously spoken about his commitment to combating the surge of anti-Asian hate crimes.” He signed a bipartisan bill aimed at addressing the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes into law in May 2021. It will create a new position at the Justice Department to expedite review of potential Covid-19-related hate crimes and incidents reported at the federal, state or local level.\n\nBiden and BTS, the White House added, “will also discuss the importance of diversity and inclusion and BTS’ platform as youth ambassadors who spread a message of hope and positivity across the world.”", "authors": ["Betsy Klein Kate Sullivan Nikki Carvajal", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan", "Nikki Carvajal"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/uk/guest-list-queen-funeral-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "title": "Who's on the guest list for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II receives a state funeral at London’s Westminster Abbey on Monday, it will be one of the largest diplomatic occasions of the century.\n\nWorld leaders, politicians, public figures and European royals, as well as more than 500 dignitaries from around the world, will descend on London to pay their last respects to Britain’s longest reigning monarch, who died on September 8 at the age of 96.\n\nWhile no official guest list has been published, invitations have been sent.\n\nWorld leaders\n\nUS President Joe Biden was among the first to confirm he will be at the event, which will be attended by up to 2,000 people.\n\n“I don’t know what the details are yet but I will be going,” Biden told reporters last Friday.\n\nThe coffin of Queen Elizabeth II arrives at Westminster Hall from Buckingham Palace for her lying in state on Wednesday, September 14, 2022.

Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nOfficial memorial altars were set up in central Seoul Monday, with photos showing crowds visiting to pay their respects. Many were in tears and holding white flowers; others knelt and bowed deeply to the altar.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and top officials including the prime minister and Seoul mayor joined the mourners.\n\nMany shops and businesses were closed to observe a week-long national period of mourning. Parts of central Seoul were nearly deserted – a highly unusual sight in the usually bustling capital that’s home to about 10 million people.\n\nPeople also paid respects at a makeshift memorial in Itaewon, outside a subway station near the alley where the crush occurred. The station entrance is adorned with rows of flowers, and offerings such as handwritten notes, bottles of the Korean liquor soju and paper cups filled with drinks.\n\nAmong the mourners was a civic group of the bereaved families of the Sewol Ferry disaster, which killed 304 people – mostly teens on a school trip – when the vessel sank in 2014.\n\n“As one who had suffered the same pain, my heart is torn and I’m rendered speechless,” one of the group’s members told reporters at the memorial, saying the families were saddened to see “a major disaster like this repeated.”\n\nQuestions about police numbers\n\nJust down the street, the entrance to the alley had been cordoned off, with security personnel standing guard as forensic teams clad in white protective suits scoured the area, still littered with trash and debris.\n\nAmid the grief, questions have emerged about the government’s handling of the incident and an apparent lack of crowd control before the tragedy.\n\nOne survivor, 22-year-old French exchange student Anne-Lou Chevalier, told CNN she passed out in the crowd after being “crushed” by fellow revelers. “At some point I had no air, and we were so crushed to other people that I couldn’t breathe at all. So, I just passed out,” Chevalier said.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses and survivors said they had seen few or no police officers in the area before the situation deteriorated.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the minister of the interior and safety said only a “normal” level of security personnel had been deployed to Itaewon because the crowd there did not seem unusually large – whereas a “considerable number” of police had been sent to another part of Seoul in response to expected protests.\n\nMourners pay tribute for victims of the deadly Halloween crowd surge in Seoul on October 31, 2022. Rebecca Wright/CNN\n\nBut – facing a backlash from Korean politicians and on social media – authorities seemed to change tack on Monday, saying they had deployed about 137 personnel to Itaewon that night, compared to about 30 to 70 personnel in previous years before the pandemic.\n\n“For this time’s Halloween festival, because it was expected that many people would gather in Itaewon, I understand that it was prepared by putting in more police force than other years,” said Oh Seung-jin, director of the violent crime investigation division at the National Police Agency.\n\nHowever, he admitted, “currently there is no separate preparation manual for such a situation where there is no organizer and a gathering of a crowd is expected.” Moreover, the police had been deployed not for crowd control – but for crime prevention and to prevent “various illegal activities.”\n\nKim Seong-ho, director of the disaster and safety management division at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, echoed these comments, saying they did not have “guidelines or a manual” for such an “unprecedented situation.”\n\nVictims emerge\n\nThe victims were mostly young people who had gone to Itaewon Saturday night, eager for South Korea’s first Halloween celebrations in years without Covid restrictions.\n\nThe death toll rose to 156 on Tuesday following the death of a critically injured woman in her 20s, Seoul police said. In total, 101 women and 55 men were killed.\n\nTwelve of the victims were teenagers and more than 100 were in their 20s, according to authorities.\n\nAmong their number were 26 foreign nationals from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nA further 149 people were injured, 33 seriously, including 15 foreign nationals.\n\nSix students who attended schools in Seoul – one middle schooler and five high schoolers – were among the dead, as well as three teachers, said the Korean Ministry of Education.\n\nThree South Korean military personnel were also among those killed, said a Korean Defense Ministry official.\n\nShin Ae-jin was a 24-year-old graduate killed in the crowd surge on Saturday, her father told CNN.\n\nShe had started working at McKinsey & Company in September. Ahead of this new phase of her life the family took a trip to Europe in July, he said.\n\n“I traveled much with her from when she was young. We took many family trips together. We are a very happy family,” her father, Shin Jung-seob, a retired venture capitalist, told CNN.\n\n“It’s sad that I won’t see her again but I feel I had a fulfilled life with her … She lived in happiness,” he said while receiving mourners at the Samsung Seoul Hospital’s funeral home in the capital.\n\n“My daughter was always bright, had many dreams, and didn’t shy away from challenges. She lived as a high achiever.”\n\nThe father said that he plans to bury his daughter next to a tree, a practice called Sumokjang where the ashes of the deceased are put in a degradable container and buried, often in a cemetery plot. The family can then visit the tree and commemorate their loved one.\n\nWhen asked why he’s choosing this type of burial, Shin said: “We wanted to remember her. A tree has life, so it grows on.”\n\nSteven Blesi, 20, a college student from Marietta, Georgia. Courtesy family of Steven Blesi\n\nTwo American college students were identified – Steven Blesi from Georgia, and Anne Gieske from Kentucky – both in their junior year.\n\nBlesi’s father, Steve Blesi, said his son had “always been an adventurer.” He was an Eagle Scout, liked basketball and wanted to learn multiple languages, he said.\n\n“Maybe in a half hour before this tragedy event took place, I texted him in WhatsApp … ‘I know you’re out and about. Stay safe. I love you.’ And I never got a response back,” Steve said. “He had an incredibly bright future that is now gone.”\n\nDan Gieske, Anne’s father, said in a statement Sunday evening that the family was “completely devastated and heartbroken,” calling Anne “a bright light loved by all.”\n\nAnne had been a nursing student studying abroad in Seoul this semester, said the president of the University of Kentucky.\n\nAnne Gieske, a student at the University of Kentucky who died in the crowd crush in Seoul.

Grace always made others feel important and her kindness left an impression on everyone she ever met. Grace always cared about others and she was loved by all,” the family wrote.\n\nAuthorities are now working with foreign embassies and families overseas, offering support with funeral arrangements.

From England’s victorious World Cup win in 1966 to Freddie Mercury and Queen’s stunning set at Live Aid in 1985, the stadium and millions of fans have witnessed events that have gone down in history.\n\nThe capital’s “iconic” stadium “is one of the world’s most beloved homes of sports”, said Ellie Stathaki in Wallpaper*. And its 133m-high arch, “dramatically lit at night”, is an “instantly recognisable” London landmark.\n\nThis week marks 100 years since the original stadium first opened its doors. Here we look back at the history of Wembley – old and new – and the triumphs and tears along the way.\n\n1923: the ‘Empire Stadium’ opens Originally built as the centrepoint of the British Empire Exhibition of 1924-25, the “Empire Stadium”, as it was called, was constructed in 300 days. Built by Sir Robert McAlpine, who founded the famous construction company, it was ready on 23 April 1923. The “old ground cost £750,000”, said Steve Curry in the Daily Mail, and its “Twin Towers” became an “icon across the world”.\n\n1923: ‘White Horse Final’ Five days after its opening the stadium hosted its first football match – the 1923 FA Cup final between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, which Bolton won 2-0. It was the first ever FA Cup final staged at Wembley, but it “could have been the last”, said Damian Mannion on talkSPORT. A “higher than anticipated” number of fans showed up and there was “huge overcrowding”. Spectators “spilled onto the pitch” and police, “led by George Scorey on Billie, the white horse”, maintained order in the historic game, despite kick-off being delayed by an hour. The match would go on to be remembered as the “White Horse Final”.\n\n1948: Olympic Games London has held three Olympic Games and in 1948 Wembley was the main setting. With no Games held in 1940 or 1944 due to the Second World War, London was “called upon at short notice to host”, said Olympics.com. Despite “shortages of essential products” due to rationing, the capital city “rose magnificently to the challenge”. Wembley hosted the opening ceremonies, track-and-field competition and other events. A commemorative plaque from the original opening of Olympic Way in 1948 has been restored and unveiled at Wembley Park.\n\n1966: England win the World Cup The date 30 July 1966 will go down in history as English football’s finest moment. Managed by Alf Ramsey and captained by Bobby Moore, the host nation won the World Cup with a 4-2 victory over West Germany after extra-time. It was an “eventful final” at Wembley with moments such as Geoff Hurst’s hat-trick and his infamous did-it-cross-the-line “phantom goal”, said Ritabrata Banerjee on Goal.com. Skipper Moore led the England team up the steps at Wembley and received the solid gold Jules Rimet trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n1968: Manchester United win the European Cup Another major moment in Wembley’s football history came on 29 May 1968 as Manchester United became the first English side to win the European Cup. In the final at Wembley, Matt Busby’s team beat Portuguese champions Benfica 4-1 after extra-time. “It was significant, too,” said Rob Dawson on ESPN, “in that it came just 10 years after the Munich air disaster,” which killed eight United players and seriously injured Busby and captain Bobby Charlton.\n\n1982: first open-air mass of Pope John Paul II’s visit to Britain Pope John Paul II travelled to the UK in 1982 for a “six-day tour during which he greeted and blessed thousands of people at 16 different venues”, said The Guardian. On 29 May the Pope held an open-air mass at Wembley with more than 70,000 people in attendance.\n\n1985: Live Aid and Queen’s ‘greatest live gig of all time’ Wembley Stadium has hosted many huge music concerts and entertainment events, but none quite as memorable as Live Aid on Saturday 13 July 1985. Raising millions of pounds for famine relief in Africa, the Wembley concert had a line-up of musical icons including David Bowie, The Who, Elton John and Paul McCartney. But it was Queen, spearheaded by their “electric front man” Freddie Mercury, who stole the show with a “spectacular performance”, said Holly Thomas on CNN. Queen’s set is often lauded as the “greatest live gig of all time”.\n\n1996: Germany win the Euros with a ‘golden goal’ The 1996 Uefa European Championship took place in England with Wembley hosting six matches – including a semi-final and the final. In the last four at Euro 96 Germany broke home hearts by winning on penalties. The Germans went on to lift the trophy, beating the Czech Republic 2-1 in the final thanks to Oliver Bierhoff’s “golden goal” at Wembley. Bierhoff’s 95th-minute winner was the “first golden goal to be scored in a major international football tournament”, said Off The Ball. The golden goal “experiment” was later phased out at major tournaments and is now “part of history”.\n\n2000: farewell to ‘old’ Wembley England’s most famous football stadium “had been in need of redevelopment for some time”, said Liam Apicella on SportsMole. So it was decided that the “famous old ground” would be knocked down and reconstructed to “bring it into line with other modern facilities around the world”. A World Cup qualifying game on 7 October 2000 saw England and Germany go head-to-head in what would be the final football match at the old Wembley.

Around 87,000 fans are set to be at the home of English football, which would smash the current attendance record for a Euros final – men’s or women’s – of 79,115, set at the 1964 final between Spain and the Soviet Union at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nUEFA, European football’s governing body, says nearly 100,000 children have attended matches so far at Euro 2022, while 47% of all fans have been women.\n\nOf course, it certainly helps that home fans have been fortunate enough to watch arguably the most talented England women’s side of all time.\n\nThe 8-0 dismantling of a dangerous Norway side, ranked just two places below England, and the 4-0 drubbing of Sweden, the second-best team in the world and a team England had previously beaten just three times, will go down as some of the most eye-catching in the Lionesses’ history.\n\nBut the path to the final wasn’t always a straightforward one. England struggled to find its rhythm in a tough opening win against Austria, before being pushed all the way in a comeback win over Spain in the quarterfinals.\n\nREAD: ‘That was lit’ – Stunning Alessia Russo back-heel goal has fans gushing as England advances to Euro 2022 final\n\nChloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp celebrate following the 8-0 win over Norway. Harriet Lander/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nEngland, though, will certainly be glad it has been put to the test ahead of its most difficult match yet. Germany boasts a quite extraordinary record in the European Championship, winning eight of the 12 editions that have been contested and reigned over the Euros crown for 22 years until defeat at the quarterfinal stage in the Netherlands five years ago.\n\nHead coach Sarina Wiegman, who guided her native Netherlands to victory at Euro 2017, is well aware of how important an England win on Sunday could be for women’s football in the country.\n\n“I think we have been an inspiration for the country already,” she told reporters on Friday, per Reuters. “You know when you win a major tournament it really makes a difference and that would make me very proud. But I don’t think further than that. Most of the time you don’t realise the impact until probably 15 years later.\n\n“We approach this game exactly the same as every other game we have played. We don’t talk about the rivalry between England and Germany; we want to show how good we are and play our best game.\n\n“There’s so much eagerness in this team to win, and so much resilience. We want so badly to show again we are the best and to play our best game. That’s what we’ve been trying to do all the time and then hopefully, that will bring us to win.”\n\n‘Nothing left to lose’\n\nAlexandra Popp, who has become Germany’s star with six goals in five games at these Euros, is one of the best feel-good stories of the summer.\n\nThe 31-year-old missed the Euros in 2013 and 2017 through injury and, for a while, it looked as though she might miss this one after injuring her knee last year, but Popp was finally able to compete when the tournament was postponed by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShe has certainly made up for lost time and was visibly emotional after scoring in the opening win against Denmark, sinking to her knees and covering her face with her hands.\n\nAlexandra Popp's six goals at Euro 2022 equals the all-time record at a single tournament. Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nPopp’s six goals at Euro 2022, matched only by England’s Beth Mead, equals the previous best goal haul at a single Euros, set by compatriot Inka Grings at Finland 2009.\n\n“I think the pressure is more on the English side, precisely because it takes place in their own country,” Popp told reporters at a press conference on Friday. “We know that from 2011 [when Germany hosted the World Cup], suddenly everyone expects something from you.\n\n“We have nothing left to lose. With that attitude we can go into the game completely free.”\n\nThere certainly seem to be no nerves in the German camp ahead of the final, with Popp turning up to the press conference wearing a mustache hidden under her mask. “Hello,” she said, greeting reporters in a gruff voice.\n\nAfter her match-winning performance against France in the semifinals, German outlets FUMS and Der Postillon ran satirical posts saying that men’s national team head coach Hansi Flick had called up a new striker for Qatar, accompanied by a photo of Popp in a mustache with the pseudonyms Alexander Bopp and Alexander Papp.\n\nThe forward will no doubt be the biggest threat England faces on the Wembley pitch come Sunday and it’s likely a moment of instinct from Popp or Mead could decide the game.\n\nThese two teams boast a brilliant defensive record at this tournament, having each conceded just one goal, and it’s likely their stingy back lines will be difficult to breach in the final.\n\nAlexandra Popp wore a fake mustache to her pre-match press conference on Friday. Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n‘Outstanding’\n\nThe quality on display at Euro 2022 only emphasizes the accelerated growth of the women’s game across the continent in recent years, as football federations have finally started to seriously invest in their teams.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who says he has been closely following Germany’s progress, said women’s football as “exploded” in recent years.\n\n“I really have to say I love women’s football, it’s outstanding,” Klopp said at a press conference on Thursday.\n\n“The quality of the tournament is insane. England is doing exceptionally well. I saw three games of Germany, they’ve been doing really well as well. It’s a really good final – two intense teams facing each other.\n\n“As much as I love England, in this specific case my heart is on the German side, but the better team might win and I’m completely fine with that. At a sold out Wembley with an English crowd, it will be a massive challenge for Germany.\n\n“Most important is the face women’s football showed, it’s a fantastic game. Women’s football, over the last few years, exploded in their development. It’s tactically and technically on an incredibly high level. The intensity of the games – physically it’s really, really good and I love watching it.\n\n“England are slight favorites playing at home, but Germany has a chance.”\n\nAfter defeat in the men’s Euros final last summer, England fans will be desperate to avoid double heartbreak.

So please get used to it, or stay out of football.”\n\nDario Minden was a relatively unknown German football fan before a video of a powerful speech he made was widely shared on social media in September.\n\nFor the majority of the 15-minute talk he spoke in his native German before switching to English, a change he deliberately made, he says, for impact. He wanted the world to hear.\n\nLooking directly at Qatar’s ambassador to Germany, Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani, in a room full of dignitaries and sponsors at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, he said his impactful words. Sitting in the front row, the camera pans briefly to al-Thani and shows him looking at and listening to Minden.\n\n“Football is for everyone,” Minden continued. “It doesn’t matter if you’re lesbian, if you’re gay, it’s for everyone. For the boys, for the girls and for everyone in between … The rule that football is for everyone is so important. We cannot allow you to break it no matter how rich you are. You are more than welcome to join the international football community and, also, of course, to host a big tournament. But in sports, it is how it is. You have to accept the rules.”\n\nWhen Minden finishes, a sprinkling of applause can be heard from some members of the audience.\n\nThat he loves men and has sex with men isn’t an issue in his homeland, but it is in Qatar, a country which from Sunday will be hosting the month-long World Cup, one of sport’s biggest and most lucrative events.\n\nVisitors gather at the FIFA World Cup countdown clock in Doha on October 30, 2022. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, it is undoubtedly a historic event, but it is also one clouded by controversy, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured as the Gulf state prepared for the tournament, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Minden said he would not be going to Qatar and would not be watching the competition on television.\n\n“When we talk about the situation for the LGBTQ+ rights, we mean not only the football tourists, but also the situation before, and especially after, the World Cup,” he said.\n\nAfter the conference, Minden said he spoke privately with the ambassador who he said told him all were welcome to Qatar. But Minden told CNN: “It’s not safe and it’s not right.”\n\n‘Everyone is welcome to Qatar’\n\nA Qatar government official told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country. “Everyone is welcome in Qatar,” the statement read, adding: “Our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”\n\nMeasures were being implemented to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nBut there have been mixed messages with a World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was “damage in the mind,” in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for its advice to any members of the LGBTQ community traveling to Qatar, FIFA referred to a recent public statement made by Fatma Samoura, the the governing body’s secretary general, who said: “No matter your race, your religion, your social and sexual orientation, you are most welcome, and Qataris are ready to receive you with the best hospitality that you can imagine.”\n\n‘I don’t feel comfortable traveling to Qatar’\n\nBut for Englishman Rob Sanderson the respecting of cultures is a “two-way street.”\n\nSanderson is Special Projects Officer of Pride in Football, a network of UK LGBTQ fan groups and one of the supporter groups which joined forces in an open letter to condemn both FIFA and the Supreme Committee, refuting the world governing body and Qatar’s claims that it would be a World Cup for all.\n\nHe is a regular at England internationals and was once the victim of a homophobic assault, he says, at Wembley four years ago, ahead of England’s match against Spain in 2018, when he had an altercation with another fan. The incident was reported to the police and investigated, he says, but there was “insufficient evidence” to proceed, he says. But, largely, he has felt accepted at England matches, where he and his friends hold pride flags aloft celebrating their community and the team.\n\nHowever, he will not be going to Qatar and says if England were to win the tournament, it would be a tarnished trophy.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable traveling out to Qatar and being in any way visible because if I’m visibly showing I’m an LGBT+ football fan, all I’m doing is drawing a target on the back of a local who is anything other than hostile towards me,” the 34-year-old told CNN.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable being used as an excuse for any hostility that would be around after the tournament. It doesn’t sit right with me.”\n\nQatar isn’t the first controversial host of a big sporting event, or even a FIFA World Cup. The last edition was held in Russia, a country which introduced laws in 2013 which banned “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.”\n\nIn the build-up to the 2018 tournament, the UK Foreign Office warned of a “heightened risks” to members of the LGBT community traveling to Russia.\n\nBut while some Pride in Football members went to Russia, Sanderson says, feeling that it was safe as Russian society had previously accepted, in the post-Soviet and pre-Putin era, same-sex relationships, none of its members are going to Qatar. “It’s a totally different environment,” he said.\n\n“They said ‘everyone’s welcome’ but they’ve signed that line off by saying ‘you must respect our culture’.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off on Sunday.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Samoura was sent out to the 32 participating nations but would not divulge the contents.\n\nA joint statement issued earlier this month by fan groups Pride in Football, The Rainbow Wall and Three Lions Pride said: “Let’s be clear, talking about human rights is neither ideological nor political. It is simply asking for decency and the ability for people to be able to watch their teams without fear of abuse.”\n\nA number of European federations also issued a statement saying they would continue to campaign at the tournament on human rights issues and compensation for migrant workers.\n\nUSA's team logo is displayed in a room used for briefings during a training session at the team's training camp in Doha ahead of Qatar 2022. Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGareth Bale, once the world’s most expensive footballer and Wales captain, will wear a OneLove armband during matches in Qatar in support of a season-long campaign which promotes diversity and inclusion. Wales is one of eight participating European countries at the World Cup supporting the initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to Qatar, the former Real Madrid player said: “We can shed a light on the problems that are going on.”\n\nHowever, Hugo Lloris, captain of France, another team participating in the OneLove campaign, said on Monday he had to “show respect” to Qatar’s culture when asked by reporters about wearing a rainbow-colored armband.\n\n“In France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to play by our rules and respect our culture – and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,” he said.\n\nEngland flew into Qatar on Tuesday on a plane called “Rain Bow” and the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) is displaying a rainbow logo at the team’s training facility in Doha. Talking to reporters, head coach Gregg Berhalter said: “We recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress, but there’s some work still to do.”\n\nThe nearer we get to the kick-off of the opening match between Qatar and Ecuador on November 20, the louder the dissenting voices are becoming and the more visible the signs of support for LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe World Cup, like the Olympics, puts the host country under a global spotlight. Usually, most controversies are forgotten once the sport starts, but such has been the intensity of focus on Qatar’s human rights record that it would be astonishing if all were forgotten by kickoff on Sunday. It is unlikely that headlines over the next month will solely be about football.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/07/28/women-in-sports-female-athletes-nj/65379717007/", "title": "Women in sports: Covering NJ female athletes at every level", "text": "Women & Sport is a NorthJersey.com column devoted to female athletes from the rec league level to those in college and the pros.

Sue Bird. Allyson Felix. Sylvia Fowles.\n\nSome of greatest female athletes in the world have reached the end of their careers this year, and are now pivoting to build their legacies beyond sport. For some, that means improving the games they long dominated as part of their next chapter. For others, it means finding a way to use their hard-earned capital to elevate like-minded leaders.\n\nThe women’s game is exploding. Look no further than some of the biggest headlines in sports this week: like how England defeated Germany before a record-breaking crowd at Wembley Stadium in the UEFA Women’s Championship final, or how the Women’s Tour de France celebrated its revival with veteran Dutch rider Annemiek van Vleuten winning the grand prize.\n\nBut, beyond the highlights, glaring gaps between the men’s game persist, keeping the women’s game from reaching its true potential. And a lot of that has to do with research, or a lack thereof.\n\nSome call it the greatest performance in 400-meter hurdles history. But for Sydney McLaughlin it might as well have been business as usual.\n\nIn a record-shattering 50.68 seconds, the 22-year-old from New Jersey broke her own world record for the fourth time in 13 months. And as she ran down the final stretch at the Hayward Field in Eugen, Oregon, the Olympic gold medalist was truly in a league of her own: she was at least 1.5 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher at the World Athletics Championships.\n\nShe is also part of an elite class of female runners who hail from the Garden State.\n\nIn the same week that the NCAA released its progress report on gender equity and college basketball, ESPN has come under fire for not inviting South Carolina women's basketball star Aliyah Boston to its annual summer awards show, the ESPYs. The two items illustrate the polarizing nature of women’s sports: One day we get to celebrate progress, and then next a glaring example is thrown into the spotlight of all the work that still needs to be done.\n\nBoston won a national championship and was named National Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year and Final Four Most Outstanding Player in 2022. She was also a nominee for the best college athlete in women’s sports at this year’s ESPYs. Yet, she was kept off the awards show guest list — a decision that has proven an epic failure for the sports broadcasting network.\n\nAt least 18 states currently ban transgender athletes from participating in sports that match their gender identity — with more bans likely to be introduced in other states. In New Jersey, the right of trans athletes is somewhat of a bedrock in the youth sports landscape.\n\nIt’s officially been one year since the name, image and likeness era began in college sports. NIL has permanently altered the college sports landscape, rushing in a new form of amateurism for student-athletes across the board. And though plenty will continue to change in the years to come with NIL, so far female athletes have been early winners, reaping the benefits of endorsement deals.\n\nThe symbolism couldn’t be clearer. One week ago the United States celebrated 50 years since Title IX became the law of the land — ushering in a new era for girls and women who played sports in the 1970s. It was a monumental milestone, and this year in its wake the conversation had shifted to finding ways to keep the momentum going.\n\nBut one day after that anniversary, momentum slowed when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and what had been for nearly 50 years a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. Reproductive freedom and women’s sports go hand in hand.\n\nIt’s been 50 years since Title IX became the law of the land. In 37 words, the landmark passage opened the door for gender equity in sports, education and society to take shape across the United States. All these years later, many doors are still just opening for girls who play sports.\n\nIn New Jersey, there are a host of untold stories about women who are making daily strides in male-dominated sports spaces. Today, I'm going to take a moment to highlight some of the modern day “firsts” for women and girls in Garden State sports.\n\nWhen you have a game flourishing at the highest level, you provide young players with a visualization of what a future in that sport looks like. There's still plenty to be done to grow a game beyond that, but it's a start.\n\nIn North Jersey and New York, Gotham FC is slowly growing the game by investing in an official reserves team in the Women’s Premier Soccer League and ramping up youth clinics. Kearny, known as Soccertown USA, is now home to the recently formed pro-am women’s team, Paisley Athletic.\n\nAthletes have been using their platforms to protest social injustices and drive change for decades. In the world of women’s sports especially, athletes have long made this type of call for action — with athletes’ demands even leading to meaningful change in recent years. After the Uvalde massacre that left 19 children and two teachers dead, Natasha Cloud of the WNBA’s Washington Mystics addressed reporters, calling on fans listening to write to their local politicians to demand change, echoing a similar call for action made by the team in 2020.\n\n“This game doesn't matter,” Cloud said. “The [21] lives that were lost today from senseless gun violence in Texas, at an elementary school — we're talking about our kids not being safe to go to school and our government is still not implementing sensible gun laws.\"\n\nWhat can we say about the W? It is the oldest running professional women’s league in the country — that alone is huge. With women’s sports leagues struggling to last more than a few seasons in recent decades, the WNBA in many ways can serve as a North Star.\n\nThe league, like most women’s sports organizations, is experiencing record growth. More people are watching. The league’s 2022 draft averaged 403,000 viewers, or 20% more than last year. That's picking up on the increase in overall viewership from last season.\n\nBetter yet, not only are more people watching professional women's basketball, they're also investing in it.\n\nThere are few teams as important to sports history as the United States women’s national soccer team. Whether talking about the squad who brought home a historic fourth World Cup title after defeating the Netherlands in the summer of 2019, or the legendary '99ers who brought women’s soccer to the mainstream, the team embodies what athletes are capable of when they challenge the status quo.\n\nTheir latest achievement? Securing equal pay with the U.S. men’s national soccer team.\n\nWomen’s sports are having a moment — not the kind of moment that will pass, but the kind that will be remembered and reflected on.\n\nNearly every day there is another breaking story that illustrates another glass ceiling shattered, or another historic milestone reached. Be it when Kelsie Whitmore became the first woman to start in an Atlantic League game, or when the Barcelona Femení beat their own record for the most attended women’s soccer match in history with 91,648 spectators at Camp Nou. Or — you get the idea.\n\nEven as I’m sitting here typing this column, news broke that FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, named three women among the 36 referees chosen to officiate at the men’s World Cup in Qatar later this year, and three more in the group of assistants.\n\nWith so much happening in the world of women’s sports, we found it important to not let these moments pass without recognition. For too long, that’s exactly what we’ve done.\n\nThat’s why we are creating a space to talk about all of it. The highs and lows. The new and the old. From the business side of sports, to youth development. From the pros, to the rec leagues. There is no topic off limits, and we are eager to highlight these stories with you, our reader.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/gene-frenette/2023/05/10/challenge-for-jaguars-is-turning-back-to-back-london-games-into-advantage/70202768007/", "title": "Challenge for Jaguars is turning back-to-back London games into ...", "text": "While the Jaguars playing back-to-back games in London isn’t likely to become a regular thing, they must capitalize on the opportunity this first-time experience affords them in 2023.\n\nAs expected, the NFL announced Wednesday the Jaguars would be playing twice in London this season, first a home game against the Atlanta Falcons on Oct. 1 at Wembley Stadium. Then on Oct. 8, the Jaguars will face the AFC East champion Buffalo Bills as the visiting team at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nFrankly, the Jaguars couldn’t have scripted a better London two-step than this Falcons-Bills doubleheader across the Atlantic.\n\nNice moves:Trading down strategy by Jaguars' GM Trent Baalke could be big depth payoff\n\nMean move:USGA changeup keeping Talor Gooch out of U.S. Open was a bit underhanded\n\nBad grades:Jaguars' 2020 draft class came back to bite me, lots of other draft analysts\n\nLooking at the nine home games this season, the Falcons and Carolina Panthers are easily the least attractive opponents. If the Jaguars had to lose a home game to London, either of those NFC South teams is better than playing a division game in London or fans losing the opportunity to see the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati Bengals, Baltimore Ravens or San Francisco 49ers (all playoff teams last year) at TIAA Bank Field.\n\nWeek 2 in London also sets up nicely. It’s a no-brainer that getting to play Buffalo — coming off a 13-3 season and with Josh Allen among the top three quarterbacks on the schedule — away from Highmark Stadium significantly diminishes the homefield advantage for what figures to be the Jaguars’ toughest road opponent in 2023.\n\nSure, there’ll be plenty of Bills fans at Tottenham Hotspur, but it’s not the same snake pit as playing the game in Buffalo, where Allen’s team is 23-6 the past three years.\n\nWhen you consider Allen and a large majority of the Bills players have never played an international game, plus the Jaguars will already be settled in London for 10 days when that matchup takes place, how can it not be an edge for the black and teal?\n\nTrevor makes things better\n\nThough only 4-5 in London games, the Jaguars now having ascending quarterback Trevor Lawrence greatly enhances their chances of winning than when the Jaguars had a weaker roster and Blake Bortles or Gardner Minshew under center.\n\nCircumstances are better than they’ve ever been for the Jaguars to win across the pond. This London double dip could work in their favor, no matter how the rest of the NFL schedule plays out when it’s released Thursday night.\n\nKeep in mind, playing two games in London may only be a one-time opportunity or a once-in-a-great-while thing for the Jaguars, who have played one game there annually since 2013, with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic year in 2020.\n\n“This was just one of those years where the schedules aligned right and we have an extra home game,” Jaguars president Mark Lamping told the Times-Union after the Wednesday NFL announcement. “This will be the first time a team hasn’t had to fly to London to play a game because we’re already there.\n\n“We were a natural party to ask. We’re anxious to learn and apply that learning into any future decisions [on playing an extra game in London].”\n\nIt’ll be up to the NFL, which has already received input from head coach Doug Pederson, as to when the Jaguars will have their bye week in 2023. That’s going to be a tough call.\n\nIf the Jaguars take a bye in Week 6 right after playing in London, which they have done seven of their previous nine times, the downside is it forces them to play for 12 consecutive remaining weeks of the regular season.\n\nOnly in 2017, after beating the Baltimore Ravens in Week 3, and last year after losing to the Denver Broncos in Week 8, did the Jaguars continue to play games upon returning from London before taking a bye week.\n\nWhen will Jaguars get bye week?\n\nIt’s a calculated risk either way for Pederson, who expressed a preference in 2022 to wait another two weeks after the Denver loss for a bye. The Jaguars beat the Las Vegas Raiders 27-20 at home the following week, then lost 27-17 to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium before getting a week off.\n\nLamping says he leaves the bye week aspect of the schedule up to what Pederson believes is best for the team. If the Jaguars pass on a bye after London, that leaves it up to the whims of the NFL schedule-makers.\n\n“They would have expressed their preference to the NFL,” said Lamping. “You always have the chance to take it after the international game.”\n\nPlaying back-to-back London games in early October, even with the Jaguars having more experience doing it than any other NFL team, doesn’t come without some risk. It’s no guarantee being in the UK for an extended period will make things better for the Jaguars for that second game against Buffalo since nobody has ever tried it.\n\nStill, since only a handful of Bills players have experienced playing a game in London — receiver Stefon Diggs, defensive tackle DaQuon Jones, defensive end Shaq Lawson and punter Sam Martin among them — it’s reasonable to think the Jaguars’ chances of winning significantly increase by taking that game away from the city of Buffalo.\n\nWhile it’s not as important as the impact on the football field, playing back-to-back games undoubtedly helps to build the Jaguars’ brand. That’s two consecutive weeks of the Jaguars playing stand-alone NFL games, albeit at 9:30 a.m. EST and 6:30 a.m. on the West coast.\n\nThis is virgin territory for the Jaguars. They’ll undoubtedly weigh what happens with playing back-to-back games in London on whether they return for a second bite of this apple.\n\nFor now, the Jaguars are doing the right thing. Why not accept taking a home game from a Super Bowl-contending team for the chance to face Buffalo at a neutral site where your franchise is more accustomed to playing?\n\nThis looks like a better win-win opportunity for the Jaguars. It’s an offer they couldn’t refuse.\n\nGfrenette@jacksonville.com: (904) 359-4540", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/10/15/ohio-stadium-has-been-the-site-for-more-than-just-ohio-state-football-games/69555674007/", "title": "Ohio Stadium has been the site for more than just OSU football games", "text": "Ohio State football is celebrating a century at the Horseshoe this year. In recognition of that, The Columbus Dispatch will be sharing special Ohio Stadium content throughout this week.\n\nOhio Stadium isn’t just the home of Ohio State football.\n\nThe Horseshoe has seen plenty of history inside its historic walls that have nothing to do with touchdowns, extra points or rivalry showdowns against That Team Up North. It’s been the site of famous concerts, memorable milestones and, occasionally, a little extra water. On the 100th anniversary of the stadium, here’s a look at some of the top non-football events to take place at The House That Harley Built.\n\nThe Flood — Spring, 1927\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that the stadium was built on a floodplain. During construction, a bend in the Olentangy River was straightened and natural drainage options were rerouted while land east of the river was graded and paved. During spring break in 1927, the south towers and stack were flooded, but the field was spared, according to university archives.\n\nFlooding in the area would remain an occasional issue, and the late-90s renovation to the stadium also included installing a slurry wall going as deep as 60 feet below ground along with an irrigation system to prevent the newly lowered field from taking on water despite sitting below the water table.\n\nOhio State first celebrates commencement at Ohio Stadium — June 1, 1928\n\nThe majority of Ohio State’s commencement speeches had been given at University Hall Chapel until William Oxley Thompson addressed the 1928 class at the football stadium. The fifth president of the university and eventually the namesake of the campus library, Thompson gave a speech titled “Higher Education – A Gift or a Purpose?” It ran 23 pages long and concluded, “Go forth and take up your stewardship, strong in the will to return to humanity, with good interest, all that humanity and nature have given you.”\n\nOhio Stadium has been the primary spring commencement site ever since. It was held elsewhere from 1943-45 during World War II, as well as in 1963. It was canceled due to weather in 1997 and returned in 1998. But following that, renovations forced it to the Oval until 2002, when President George W. Bush delivered the commencement address.\n\nJesse Owens races at Ohio Stadium — 1934-36\n\nThe greatest athlete to ever compete for Ohio State was, quite possibly, not a football player.\n\nJesse Owens raced around the track at Ohio Stadium for three years. The Horseshoe wasn’t the scene of Owens’ biggest achievements, however.\n\nHe won four NCAA titles in Berkeley, California, in 1935 and duplicated that feat in 1936 at Stagg Field in Chicago. The \"Buckeye Bullet\" went to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and brought home four gold medals.\n\nBut the most famous day in Owens’ career, which remains one of the greatest individual accomplishments in American sports history, occurred at the Big Ten Championships in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Owens set world records in the 100-yard dash, the 220-yard dash, the 220 low hurdles and the long jump, and he did so all within the span of 45 minutes.\n\nThe play's the thing — 1950\n\nOhio Stadium served as the stage for one of America's first university-community summer theatres. Taking place outside of gate ten, the productions were originally directed by Roy Bowen, part of the more than 150 plays he directed for The Ohio State University over a career spanning more than 60 years.\n\nInaugural Jesse Owens Classic — Spring 1985\n\nThe Ohio State track was removed from Ohio Stadium in 1999 with a new facility, Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium, eventually replacing it. The school also hosts an annual event named after the OSU legend. And it was first held at the Horseshoe in 1985, when 38 Olympians participated in the Jesse Owens Classic.\n\nOhio State track and field:Ohio State has produced more world class sprinters than just Jesse Owens | Rob Oller\n\nIt's one of Owens' enduring legacies and a fitting salute to his status as one of the country’s first Black icons in sports\n\nPink Floyd plays Ohio Stadium — May 28, 1988\n\nThere have since been bigger concerts – roughly 90,000 took in the 2015 installment of Buckeye Country Superfest featuring Kenny Chesney and Rascal Flatts, among others – but they might not have happened if not for a group of British stars proving that the Horseshoe could rock. Pink Floyd was the first band to stage a concert at Ohio Stadium, and a crowd of nearly 64,000 paid $20 for reserved tickets that were first offered to Ohio State students, faculty and alumni. T-shirts went for $18, and those who bought one had a tangible memento from what, to that point, was the largest concert in Columbus history.\n\nColumbus Crew first home match — April 13, 1996\n\nBefore Crew Stadium became Major League Soccer's first soccer-specific stadium, and Columbus evolved into the spiritual home of the U.S. national teams, the Crew played their first three seasons at Ohio Stadium.\n\nThe Crew’s top draft pick and eventual U.S. men’s national team staple Brian McBride scored two goals and electrified the 25,266 in attendance for the Crew’s 4-0 victory against D.C. United. The inaugural home match for the first club of MLS showed what was possible for soccer in the city and America, writ large.\n\nColumbus mourns — Sept. 15, 2001\n\nFour days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, more than 10,000 residents and students gathered at the stadium for a one-hour service to show their patriotic spirit and support relief efforts of the American Red Cross. For a $10 donation, attendees received an American flag at concession stands, which had been turned into donation sites, while a list of speakers including Ohio governor Bob Taft and Columbus mayor Michael B. Coleman expressed their hopes for peace.\n\nThe event culminated with a single trumpeter playing taps.\n\nParis Saint-Germain vs. Real Madrid — July 27, 2016\n\nOhio Stadium hosted an International Champions Cup game between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid — two of the best and most recognized soccer teams around the globe. The match was ostensibly a glorified preseason exhibition for both teams, but Ohio Stadium was filled to the brim with soccer fans who traveled hundreds of miles for a rare glimpse at some of the best players in the world.\n\nThere were 86,641 fans on hand to watch PSG beat Ream Madrid 3-1. It remains a record for a soccer match in Ohio.\n\nOhio State men’s lacrosse beats No. 2 Maryland — April 22, 2017\n\nThe Buckeyes took down perennial men’s lacrosse powerhouse Maryland at Ohio Stadium in a dramatic 11-10 overtime victory, and the 2017 win remains one of the most important in program history.\n\nIt helped Ohio State advance to the national championship later that season, where it then lost to the Terrapins, 9-6.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/sport/cnn-sports-top-stories-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "CNN Sports' top stories of 2022 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom a World Cup like no other in Qatar to Ukrainian athletes returning home to fight in the war against Russia, CNN Sport has picked out the must-read stories from the last 12 months.\n\nMajor interviews and CNN exclusives\n\nGay Australian footballer Josh Cavall reflects on life-changing year\n\nIt has been more than a year since Josh Cavallo announced he is gay, but even now he still struggles to comprehend the far-reaching impact his announcement has had.\n\nSince making that life-changing decision in October 2021, Cavallo has become one of the most recognizable names and faces in world football, as well as becoming something of an icon.\n\n“I’m walking in the streets of London and getting stopped,” Cavallo told CNN in October.\n\n“I’ve only been to London twice now and I’m like: ‘Wow, I’m all the way from Australia and what I did was via social media,’ and to see the impact it’s had from people on the other side of the globe is absolutely phenomenal.”\n\nJosh Cavallo has become one of football's most recognizable faces since coming out as gay.

They took my friend quite aggressively on the arm and pushed him away from the crowd and told him to take it [the armband] off,” Kunkel told CNN,\n\nGerman fan Bengt Kunkel wearing a rainbow-colored arm and wristband outside Stadium 974 on Saturday, November 26. Ben Church/CNN\n\nExclusive – ‘This is not saving, this is destruction’: Ukrainian MMA champion Yaroslav Amosov recounts the horrors of war\n\nAfter Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, a number of high-profile Ukrainian athletes chose to return to their home country and help in the war efforts.\n\nAmong them was Yaroslav Amosov, a reigning welterweight world champion in the MMA championship Bellator.\n\nOn May 13, he should have been defending his world title at Bellator’s event at Wembley Arena in London. Instead, Amosov returned to his hometown of Irpin and joined the territorial defense to aid civilians in and around the town.\n\n“It’s hard to look at your city that was once full of happiness, life,” Amosov told CNN’s Matias Grez in an exclusive interview back in May.\n\nYaroslav Amosov missed his world title fight to return to Ukraine.\n\nRemembrance Sunday: For one dissenting voice, this is his most dangerous day\n\nFor footballer James McClean, Remembrance Sunday is arguably his most difficult day of the year.\n\nSince he first refused to wear the poppy in 2012, McClean and his family have been subjected to abuse both in football stadiums across England and online.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland international, who was born in Northern Ireland, has been outspoken about what the poppy and Remembrance Sunday mean to his community and its relationship to the British military.\n\nJames McClean has been regularly abused for his stance on the poppy. Getty Images\n\nYouTubers, doping and greed: It’s been a tough year for boxing\n\nSimiso Buthelezi, Miracle Amaeze and Luis Quiñones are some of the talented boxers who have died this year as they pursued their sporting careers and chased dreams of world titles.\n\nIt’s an accepted risk of the profession. A database first compiled by anti-boxing activist Manuel Velazquez and updated in the Electronic Journal of Martial Arts and Sciences estimated 1,604 boxers died as a direct result of injuries sustained in the ring between 1890 and 2011 – an average of 13 deaths a year.\n\nThat’s a shocking statistic for a professional sport, but perhaps not altogether that surprising. As Stephanie Alessi-LaRosa, director of Hartford Healthcare’s sports neurology program, points out, it’s a boxer’s objective in a fight “to neurologically impair the opponent.”\n\n2022 has been a tough year for the sport of boxing.\n\nLongform storytelling\n\n‘Our dreams never came true.’ These men helped build Qatar’s World Cup, now they are struggling to survive\n\nThe plight of migrant workers in Qatar was a dark cloud that marred what should have been the greatest sporting spectacle on the planet.\n\nFor all the incredible action on the pitch, including arguably the greatest World Cup final in history, tournament organizers could not escape accusations that the workers who helped build the stadiums were subjected to awful conditions, which contributed to the deaths of migrant workers.\n\nAhead of the World Cup, CNN spoke to Kamal, a Nepali worker in Qatar, who recounted his experience of being arrested without explanation and kept in a Qatari jail for a week.\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\nThe treatment of migrant workers was a major talking point throughout the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

By the time she was nine or 10, Cline had outgrown her local coaches and was now travelling an hour from home to train at an elite club.\n\nFor a while, her love of the sport continued, but Cline says everything changed when Vladimir Lashin and his wife Svetlana arrived as the new coaching team. Cline says that the mood in the gym quickly darkened.\n\n“Immediately, it was verbally abusive,” she recalled. “If you made any mistakes, they would scream and humiliate you.” According to Cline, it wasn’t long before the coaches resorted to physical abuse, too.\n\nAmelia Cline spoke to CNN about the alleged abusive training regime. Courtesy Amelia Cline\n\nHow has this World Cup affected the ‘brands’ associated with it?\n\nTraditionally billions of viewers watch the World Cup, and as they concentrate on what is happening on the pitch, the names of some of the world’s biggest companies flash behind the players on a rolling, technicolored loop – Budweiser, Visa, Coca-Cola, Qatar Airways, Adidas, McDonalds, Wanda, Vivo, Hyundai Kia.\n\nBut Qatar 2022 is different. Many of these brands, particularly those with Western world roots, have become caught in the geopolitical crosshairs of this tournament, balancing their sponsorship with criticisms levelled at FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, and Qatar, the host, notably around human rights issues.\n\nNot that it is affecting FIFA’s bottom line.\n\nSeveral 'brands' have become associated with the Qatar World Cup.

STAFF/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEven being in the presence of the ball, as he was at Wembley Stadium in London ahead of the auction, brings back uneasy memories for Butcher.\n\nIt’s a reminder of how he remonstrated with Tunisian referee Ali Bin Nasser after Maradona’s first goal, and of how he tried in vain to stop the second with an outstretched leg.\n\n“It’s really weird to be in the same room as the ball, it’s difficult to explain,” Butcher adds. “It’s quite surreal in many respects … That ball – it’s the biggest injustice the world’s ever seen when it comes to football matches.”\n\n‘Hand of God’ controversy\n\nIn the aftermath of his death two years ago, memorabilia from Maradona’s life and career have fetched huge sums at auction.\n\nIn May, the jersey he wore against England sold for $9.3 million, at the time making it the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia in history.\n\nAs for the match ball, it is currently owned by Nasser after FIFA, football’s global governing body, declared that referees would get to keep the ball after each game they officiated at the 1986 World Cup.\n\nThe match ball from the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal is expected to sell for up to $3.3 million. ISABEL INFANTES/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNasser is 78 now and his refereeing days are long behind him. With the proceeds from the sale, which is being overseen by Graham Budd Auctions in the UK, he will donate some of the money to charity and says the remainder will “raise my standard of life a little.”\n\n“It is a gift from God,” Nasser tells CNN Sport, “because I had a career of 25 years … and I made all the decisions that needed to be made.”\n\nAsked about Maradona’s first goal and Nasser is eager to defend his reasons for letting it stand.\n\nFIFA’s instructions for the tournament, he says, were to rely on other match officials if they had a better view of an incident. Unable to see what had happened in the aerial contest between Maradona and Shilton, Nasser instead turned to his linesman, Bulgarian Bogdan Dochev.\n\n“[Dochev] arrived at the center line, which means the goal is 100% valid,” says Nasser, adding that he “applied the FIFA guidelines regarding the first goal.”\n\nMaradona's controversial hand ball gave Argentina a 1-0 lead against England at the 1986 World Cup. Bob Thomas/Getty Images/file\n\nFor his part, Dochev, who passed away five years ago, said he thought he saw “something irregular” about the goal, but claimed FIFA protocols didn’t allow assistants to discuss decisions with the referee. The fallout from the incident would tarnish his refereeing career.\n\n“Diego Maradona ruined my life,” Dochev later told Bulgarian media in the years before his death. “He is a brilliant footballer but a small man. He is low in height and as a person too.”\n\n‘A genius footballer’\n\nWhile multiple balls would be used over the course of a match in today’s game, back then only one was used for the full 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to Graham Budd, the auction house chairman at Graham Budd Auctions, Nasser’s ball has been cross-checked against match footage and high-res photographs, while an independent body has also verified it as the original.\n\nWith the World Cup beginning in Qatar on Sunday, this week was an optimum time for the ball to go up for auction.\n\nThere were hopes it would become the most expensive sports ball ever sold at auction by eclipsing the $3 million paid for Mark McGwire’s 70th home run baseball in 1999.\n\nHowever, after receiving interest from several potential buyers, Graham Budd Auctions said negotiations between the seller and interested parties are ongoing after the bidding failed to reach the pre-sale reserve.\n\nAli Bin Nasser speaks to the media following Maradona's death two years ago. FETHI BELAID/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe ball’s sizable price tag is not only derived from the nature of Maradona’s two interventions.\n\nThe match was the first time England and Argentina had met on a sporting arena since the Falklands or Malvinas War four years earlier, and many of the players had – at least on Argentina’s side – friends or relatives who had been conscripted to fight in the war.\n\nThat backdrop created a sense of drama well before the “Hand of God” took center stage.\n\n“We had an energy, a great desire to win, not just because it was England, but also so that our country could in one way be happy,” Jorge Luis Burruchaga, who would go on to score the winning goal in the final for Argentina against West Germany, told CNN Sport four years ago.\n\n“We were aware that we wouldn’t bring back the dead of the Falklands War, but we were aware that we would bring some happiness.”\n\nFormer England international Peter Reid also acknowledges the political context of the game, which he says contributes to the “unique” status of the match ball.\n\n“There’s a lot of Argentinians there, there was a lot of pressure on both sets of players, and that’s when he [Maradona] handled the pressure really well,” says Reid. “Whatever you say, he was a genius footballer.”\n\nAnd as for the first goal? “Listen, he’s cheated,” adds Reid, “but he’s been very clever as well.”\n\nDespite his decades-long career in football as a player and manager, Reid says he still gets mocked for being outpaced by Maradona for the second goal – even by the man himself when the pair met in Jordan many years later.\n\nAnd while it was Nasser who kept the “Hand of God” match ball from that game and his old teammate Steve Hodge who kept Maradona’s shirt, Reid did end up with a gift from his wily opponent – albeit decades after they had faced each other in Mexico City.\n\n“He came with a signed shirt for me: ‘To my friend. Lots of love, Diego Maradona,’” says Reid. “I’ve got that on my wall, so that’s not a bad one. I’ll hold onto it.”", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

Jean Carroll: A fixture of New York night life, media before suit", "text": "When E. Jean Carroll took the stand Wednesday in her defamation lawsuit against former president President Donald Trump, she spoke of how he'd maligned her character.\n\n\"When I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen,'' said Carroll, who first revealed the alleged assault in a 2019 memoir. \"He lied and shattered my reputation, and I’m here to try and get my life back.\"\n\nCarroll who was cross-examined for hours by Trump's attorney Thursday, first sued Trump in 2019 and then filed another claim in November under a New York state law which gives abuse victims a year to sue even if the statute of limitation has ended for the alleged crime.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied Carroll's rape allegation, and Carroll says Trump's statements that she was \"lying'' and engaged in a \"complete con job'' led to her being bombarded with a deluge of hateful messages.\n\nCross-examined:Donald Trump's lawyer questions rape accuser E. Jean Carroll\n\nCarroll has been questioned and scrutinized for the story she told and the winding, sometimes colorful way she told it ever since she lodged her accusation. But the pioneering journalist has said that initially, she was surrounded by support.\n\n”I’ve been in a cocoon of love and support,'' Carroll told USA TODAY in a phone interview in 2019, saying then that people had been sending her positive messages, texts, and even approaching her on the street.\n\nIt was likely not the response some would have imagined. But Carroll has spent a lifetime defying expectations.\n\nJournalism pioneer, beauty queen\n\nA former beauty queen, she became a pioneer in the world of literary journalism. A daughter of the Midwest, she found renown in the elite media circles of New York. And in her 70s, Carroll remained a beacon to millions of readers seeking out her frank talk about sex, success and love.\n\nThe accusation:E. Jean Carroll told two people about her alleged rape. This is what they remember.\n\nThe coverage:Why are we so reluctant to talk about Carroll's accusation?\n\nIn 2019, Lisa Chase remembered the first time she read a piece by Carroll.\n\n“I thought she was hilarious,'' said Chase, who'd first edited Carroll three decades earlier when Chase was an editor with Outside magazine. \"When you hire E. Jean, you want a funny story with feeling and empathy.''\n\nBut though the two women became friends, Carroll's allegations of being sexually assaulted byTrump in a posh Manhattan department store nearly 30 years ago was one Carroll never shared.\n\n\"I was asking her for years to write a memoir,'' said Chase, who edited Carroll's advice column in Elle magazine from 2005 to 2017. \"I had no idea she had these stories. She kept them to herself.\"\n\nCarroll's book, “What Do We Need Men For?'' detailed an allegation, first excerpted in New York magazine, that Trump assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. Two of Carroll's friends confirmed to the New York Times that she told them about the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred. Trump has continuously denied assaulting her.\n\nThe book:E. Jean Carroll's book is out. What to know about her allegation\n\n\"This is a fraudulent & false story,\" Trump has said on his Truth Social website.\n\nE. Jean Carroll was 'out talking to people'\n\nLong before this fraught moment in the media's glare, Carroll was a journalistic luminary, known for her Ask E. Jean advice column, and for being a presence amid the glitzy nightlife scene of 1980s and 90s New York.\n\n\"There's a circuit in New York,'' said Chase. \"You go out to events. You go to premieres. ... You go to dinner parties. She was on TV. She was writing. She was beautiful and smart and funny. She was married to a person (John Johnson) who was a big on-air personality. She was in that world.''\n\nCarroll carved a niche in television, writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" in the 1980s and hosting her own \"Ask E. Jean'' show on MSNBC's predecessor, America's Talking, from 1994 to 1996.\n\nBut it was her writing, featured in publications like Rolling Stone and Playboy – where Carroll became the first woman to be named a contributing editor – that established Carroll as a trailblazer.\n\n\"That was the tabloid era,'' Roger Friedman, editor-in-chief of the entertainment news website Showbiz411, said in a 2019 interview.\n\nFriedman, who edited Fame magazine from 1987 to 1991 and later wrote New York magazine's Intelligencer column said: \"People were chasing scoops. You didn't have cell phones. You didn't have the internet. You had to get up, put your hat on and get the story. ... She was a person out talking to people.''\n\nCarroll became known for a style of writing and reporting dubbed gonzo journalism. A hallmark of writers like Hunter S. Thompson, whose biography Carroll wrote, and Tom Wolfe, it was a school of storytelling in which journalists often made themselves part of the tale, offering up humorous – sometimes outrageous – personal experiences.\n\n\"In the literary journalism world, she was a player, which is saying a lot,'' Chase said. \"There weren't a lot of women who were being hired by men's magazines. And she was.''\n\nCarroll also drew comparisons to famed filmmaker and writer Nora Ephron.\n\n\"Both are fiendish reporters who find their subject matter in left field,'' Kirkus Review wrote in a critique of \"Female Difficulties: Sorority Sisters, Rodeo Queens, Frigid Women, Smut Stars, And Other Modern Girls,\" a book Carroll penned in the 1980s. \"Carroll, though, is wilder than Ephron, content not just to set a scene but sometimes to steal one, too.”\n\nCandace Bushnell, the writer whose \"Sex and The City'' column in the New York Observer inspired the iconic HBO show of the same name, was a fan.\n\n\"I’ve known E. Jean or known of her since at least the ’ ’80s,'' Bushnell said in an email sent to USA TODAY in 2019. \"She was the coolest woman journalist around – daring, had a ton of guts, and was as funny as the guys. She was a female gonzo journalist. In the mid-nineties I hung out with her quite a bit. ... There really wasn’t and isn’t anyone else like her.''\n\nChase said the last piece she asked Carroll to write was about an all-woman rafting trip. \"I think we called it women who run with no clothes on because at some point in the trip all the women took off their clothes and rafted naked down the river, which I'm sure was her idea. ... She's had an adventurous life.''\n\nYoung E. Jean Carroll\n\nElizabeth Jean \"Jeannie\" Carroll's journey started out much more conventionally.\n\nCarroll spent her childhood in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the oldest of four children in a family that included a younger brother and two sisters.\n\nIt was a Midwestern life, in mid-century America. But Carroll felt that she could be whatever, and whoever, she wanted to be. \"I was free,'' she told USA TODAY. \"I grew up in the '40s and '50s. I rode my bike all over town. I started to drive when I was 14. ... The world will knock you down, pay you less, tell you you're not as good. But when you're a kid, everything is possible.''\n\nCarroll's writing ambitions bloomed early. \"I was filling the U.S. mail with pitches to magazines ... at the age of 12,'' she remembers. \"So apparently I thought of myself as a writer. I mean, if I'm writing to the Sears and Roebuck catalog, pitching a story to them, I guess I wanted to be a writer.''\n\nA member of the class of 1967, Carroll was named Miss Indiana University, as well as Miss Cheerleader U.S.A., which earned her a scholarship.\n\nCarroll was also a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, but in an article in the October 1996 issue of Indianapolis Monthly, she says that the group \"kicked me out 20 years later for something I wrote for Playboy about sorority rush. I wasn't too kind.''\n\nThe first time Carroll touched down in New York was after college.\n\n\"I thought it was the most marvelous place in the world,'' she said. Her first job? \"Honda had their new motorcycle, and I sat on the Honda and greeted people at the World's Fair in the Japanese exhibit right across from the Japanese tea ceremony people. It was fabulous.''\n\nPeople from Indiana visiting the exhibition recognized her, asking if she was that cheerleader who'd been Miss Indiana University. \"I'd say, 'No, who are you talking about?' \"\n\nAfter that first brush with Manhattan, Carroll traveled to Africa, lived in Montana with her first husband, Steve Byers, and spent time in Chicago. But after she landed a piece in Esquire, Carroll's writing career began to take off.\n\nShe returned to New York to interview Fran Lebowitz for the cover of Outside magazine, and she stayed for good.\n\n\"I had jeans, cowgirl boots, a fringe jacket, a couple of shirts,'' she says. \"And that's it.\"\n\nE. Jean Carroll in the 80s\n\nIn her book, Carroll says that she had only met Trump once before the day she says she encountered him at Bergdorf Goodman. Trump, meanwhile, has said that he doesn't know her.\n\nHowever, there is a photograph showing that their paths did cross. Dated \"around 1987,'' it is a shot of Carroll; her then-husband, former New York City anchorman John Johnson; and Trump with his first wife, Ivana.\n\nAt the time the picture was taken, Times Square had not yet become the tourist mecca some later disparagingly likened to Disneyland. In those days, visitors to New York were still being warned not to ride the subway after dark.\n\n“In the 80s, everyone worried about getting mugged,'' Friedman recalled. \"There was graffiti everywhere and your car was constantly broken into. ... Cars all had signs that said 'no radio inside.' \"\n\nBut New York was also the capital of media, finance and fashion, and for a glittering set, it was a glamorous, golden era. Studio 54, the legendary disco, shut its doors in 1980, but new night spots like Nell's rose up on the scene, and eateries like Michael's were among the cool corners where the chic and powerful gathered.\n\nOne of the most legendary was the bar and restaurant Elaine's, frequented by a local who's who of writers, actors and artists.\n\n\"I lived in Elaine's,'' Carroll said. \"I knew everybody there. I was sitting at the writer's table and that was heaven on Earth. ... You could go in at any time and there was always a table of writers, and you would just sit down. Sometimes detectives would join us. Sometimes prizefighters. But there was always a writers' table, and it was usually on a Thursday night.''\n\nEveryone who was anyone in the world of publishing would pass through, she says, including Jackie Kennedy, who was an editor, Norman Mailer, and Gay Talese. \"Sometimes the evenings would be so hot with celebrities, it was unbelievable.''\n\nElaine's was also where she met Johnson, \"the big-time New York anchorman, and one of the prettiest and most accomplished men in Manhattan,'' she wrote in \"What Do We Need Men For?\" Johnson was sitting with TV journalist Geraldo Rivera, who, when the couple got married in the Hamptons, served as their best man.\n\nTrump was also a fixture on New York's nightlife scene. The 1980s was the decade when Trump Tower first opened its doors and Trump's memoir \"The Art of the Deal'' was published. Both helped turn him into a celebrity, propelling Trump's brash, boastful persona beyond the pages of the local tabloids to appearances on national shows like \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nE. Jean Carroll in the 90s\n\nMeanwhile, Carroll's writing career continued to thrive. In 1993, her Ask E. Jean column debuted in Elle, and for nearly three decades, Carroll doled out tough love to its millions of readers, cushioning her guidance with humor, irreverence and references that included Saint Teresa and the artist Frida Kahlo.\n\nIn one column, dated Sept. 20, 2006, a woman wrote that she was \"married to the perfect man'' but was miserable because her wealthy husband was reluctant to even pay for her to get a facial.\n\nCarroll first gave the woman a recipe for homemade beauty treatment (\"Puree three tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of milk and 10 strawberries ... Your skin will be instantly shimmerized.\"). She then told the advice seeker to get a job and to get out of the marriage.\n\n\"Now that you feel better, take a look around and ask yourself: Why am I letting this creep control my life?'' Carroll wrote. \"Hunny, he's well on his way to becoming an abuser. Get out while you can. ... Hire a good divorce attorney and leave.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of realism in her advice to women.\" said Chase, Carroll's editor at Elle. \"She thought about the way women really lived. ... She might say, 'Yes, you should leave him, but will you? Can you? And if you can’t, here's what you can do to ... get to that point.' \"\n\nIn the course of their friendship, Chase said she, too, had received some straightforward advice from Carroll, who ran a dating service and had set her up on a couple of dates.\n\n\"She said to me ... 'It's impossible, you're never going to find anybody,'' said Chase, who was resuming dating after her husband, Peter Kaplan, the former editor of the New York Observer, died in 2013. \"I knew what she was saying. 'It's going to be very hard for you to find somebody who you love the way you loved him.' ... It turns out she wasn’t totally right because I did find someone I love. But it was a truthful moment, which I really appreciated.’’\n\nStill, given the era in which Carroll grew up, Chase said that she was not surprised that a consummate giver of guidance would keep some of her own troubling experiences to herself.\n\n\"She’s of a generation of women who were brought up not to do that,'' Chase said. \"She was beautiful and expected to do and be certain things and she wanted a bigger life. ...She's empathic. But she's also private about things.''\n\nCarroll's writing style and voice have informed her recounting of Trump's alleged sexual assault. And some have questioned the way she's described a traumatic event, as well as her refusal initially to call what she says happened rape.\n\n“Every woman gets to choose her word,'' Carroll said in an interview on the New York Times' The Daily podcast after her allegation against Trump was first revealed. \"Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. ... I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That’s the thing.’’\n\nBut during her first day of testimony Wednesday, Carroll was clear.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me,\" she said.\n\n'You've got nothing to lose'\n\nCarroll told USA TODAY that there was no mystery to how she came up with the nuggets she dispensed over decades to her readers.\n\n\"Giving advice is just following common sense,'' she said . \"Nothing special. That's it. I think that's why a lot of therapists write to me. ... They have studied for years and years and years, the psychology and the human being, but sometimes it’s just a common-sense thing and the simplest advice will work.''\n\nWhen Carroll needs guidance, she said she turned to an unexpected source, reading passages written by classic writers like Henry David Thoreau and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAurelius in particular has provided her the words she seems to have lived by.\n\n\"I learned that when you get up in the morning you have to believe that this could be the day you die and that grass will be very shortly growing on your grave, and so get on with it,\" she says. \"It’s a real good way to get up. ... It really keeps you happy, oddly enough, because you've got nothing to lose.''\n\nContributing: Associated Press, Maria Puente, Nyssa Kruse, Indianapolis Star\n\nFollow Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/26/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump-trial/11742730002/", "title": "'Donald Trump raped me': E.

Carroll said their friendly conversation turned ugly and Trump forced himself upon her over her objections.\n\nAfter accusing him of rape in her testimony, Carroll added: \"When I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I’m here to try and get my life back.\"\n\nTrump attacks\n\nBefore Carroll took the stand, Trump on social media again questioned the plaintiff's veracity and claimed that the lawsuit is politically motivated.\n\n\"She didn’t scream?\" Trump said at one point. \"There are no witnesses? Nobody saw this? She never made a police complaint?\"\n\nCarroll's lawyers brought up the posts to Kaplan, who admonished Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina. The judge said Trump appears to be trying to tell supporters – and perhaps jurors – about issues that are not pertinent to the case.\n\nFirst witness\n\nCarroll's lawyers opened their case with a former employee at Bergdorf Goodman. Cheryl Beall, a store manager at the time, talked about how spacious the store was and that it was set up almost like an apartment.\n\nTrump is not on trial for a criminal charge of rape\n\nBecause this is a civil case, Trump's not at risk of a criminal conviction for sexual assault; it is a potential civil judgment against him for millions of dollars, based on grisly evidence.\n\nCarroll's lawsuit accuses Trump of defamation – lying about her after she wrote about the alleged rape in a 2019 memoir.\n\nA 'strange sisterhood:'How a ‘strange sisterhood’ of #MeToo accusers is reacting to Trump’s indictment in hush money case\n\nTrump and 'Me Too:'Two women dealt a blow to Donald Trump's power.

Jean Carroll's civil defamation lawsuit against Trump began Tuesday.\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg sought to limit Trump's social media posts in hush-money case.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence testifies in Justice Department investigation of Jan. 6 attack.\n\nWASHINGTON – Former Vice President Mike Pence's testimony before a federal grand jury is only one of the high-profile developments in the investigations of former President Donald Trump this week.\n\nPence, as president of the Senate, was key to Trump’s strategy to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He testified Thursday before the grand jury in Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation of Trump’s role in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s other legal challenges include:\n\nHere’s what we know about the legal cases:\n\nPence testifies in DOJ investigation of Capitol attack Jan. 6\n\nPence testified for hours on Thursday, spending at least seven hours at the courthouse.\n\nHe is a key figure in any Jan. 6 because Trump and his allies pressured him to single-handedly reject electors from seven states President Joe Biden won, to flip the election to Trump. Pence refused to participate.\n\nTrump tried to block Pence's testimony by appealing to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a three-judge panel denied his appeal Wednesday.\n\nIn previous testimony before the House committee that investigated the attack, Pence aides described how Trump pressured and scolded his vice president.\n\nGreg Jacob, Pence’s general counsel, testified that Trump called Pence the morning of Jan. 6 in a “heated” exchange. Jacob said Pence took the call privately but returned looking “steely, determined, grim.”\n\nSmith hasn’t announced any schedule for completing his inquiry, but legal experts say the high-status level of witnesses being subpoenaed suggests charging decisions could be coming soon.\n\nDOJ investigates classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago\n\nSmith is also investigating classified documents found in a search of Mar-a-Lago, 18 months after Trump left the White House. A conviction for retaining sensitive records could disqualify Trump, who is campaigning for the White House in 2024, from holding federal office again.\n\nAt stake in the case are documents that contained some of the country’s most important secrets, including the names of undercover agents overseas, according to national security experts.\n\nAgain, subpoenas to high-level witnesses such as Trump’s lawyers suggest the investigation may be nearing a decision on charges. Attorney-client privilege doesn’t cover the discussion of potentially illegal acts.\n\nLegal experts say it might be the most open-and-shut case against Trump. But trying a case over national secrets risks more exposure of what was in the sensitive documents. But public opinion on the case was perhaps challenged after authorities retrieved classified records from the locations associated with President Joe Biden and Pence, as well.\n\nE. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit over rape allegation begins\n\nCarroll’s civil lawsuit was the first of Trump’s current legal troubles to make it to trial, with opening arguments Tuesday.\n\nCarroll alleges Trump raped her in the changing room of a Manhattan clothing store in 1996, which she didn’t report at the time. After she described the incident in a 2019 memoir, while Trump was president, he “used the most powerful platform on earth to lie about what he had done, attack Ms. Carroll’s integrity and insult her appearance,” attorney Shawn Crowley told the newly selected jury.\n\n“I’m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen,” Carroll told jurors. “He lied and shattered my reputation, and I’m here to try and get my life back.”\n\nTrump earlier said Carroll was “totally lying,” and he called the case a “hoax,” a “lie” and a “complete con job.”\n\nTrump hasn’t attended the trial yet, but U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan admonished his legal team and suggested that the defendant is risking a contempt of court citation.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg seeks to limit Trump's social media posts about hush-money case\n\nIn Manhattan, District Attorney Bragg urged a judge to limit Trump’s access to sensitive documents in a felony case alleging the former president falsified business records.\n\nBragg also asked the judge prohibit Trump from posting the contents of the documents on social media. At stake are documents dealing with material such as grand jury testimony and victim name and contact information.\n\nBragg said he wasn’t seeking a gag order. But he proposed that Trump only be allowed to review sensitive materials while accompanied by his lawyers and not be allowed to copy or transcribe the information.\n\nBragg argued his precautions were based on Trump attacking witnesses, jurors and investigators in the past, including in DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and two House impeachments.\n\nTrump is charged with falsifying business records to hide payments to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with him before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution politically motivated.\n\nThe trial is scheduled in January 2024.\n\nGeorgia prosecution sets July-August time frame for decision on criminal charges\n\nFulton County D.A. Willis warned local law enforcement officials in Georgia about the potential for “significant public reaction\" when grand jury results are announced in July or August, setting a summer timeframe for a long-awaited decision in her inquiry.\n\nWillis has been investigating two potential ways Trump might have committed election fraud.\n\nOne is that in the weeks after the 2020 election, Trump’s campaign recruited Republican electors as alternates to the official electors in Georgia and other states Democrat Joe Biden won. No states agreed to those fake electors.\n\nThe second vein Willis is exploring deals with Trump personally calling Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, to plead with him to “find” the votes he needed to win the state. By that point, Trump had tried to call him 18 times and Raffensperger had avoided taking the calls, according to an investigation by the House of Representatives.\n\n“I just want to find 11,780 votes,” Trump said. “Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already.”\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and declared the call “perfect.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/960652/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-27-april-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 27 April 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Braverman denies Sudan routes\n\nThe Home Secretary has ruled out safe and legal routes for Sudanese asylum seekers.

Customers complained about Ticketmaster not loading, saying the platform didn’t allow them to access tickets, even if they had a pre-sale code for verified fans.\n\nOn Thursday, Ticketmaster announced that the sale to the general public, which was scheduled to begin Friday, had been canceled due to “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”\n\n“To those who didn’t get tickets, all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to get together and sing these songs,” Swift added.\n\nAnti-hero behavior\n\nTaylor Swift is one of the most popular artists in music. That popularity made it hard to find a ticket to her new tour. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nThe issues for Ticketmaster started on Tuesday, when the site’s sale kicked off for “verified fans” — a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots that gives presale codes to individuals.\n\nThe “verified fan” platform was created in 2017 to help Ticketmaster handle situations of enormous demand, but as more than 3.5 million people pre-registered to be a Swift “verified fan” the system became overwhelmed. That’s the largest registration in the company’s history, according to Ticketmaster.\n\n“Historically, working with ‘Verified Fan’ invite codes has worked as we’ve been able to manage the volume coming into the site to shop for tickets,” the company wrote on Thursday in a blog post that has since been taken down. “However, this time the staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes drove unprecedented traffic on our site.”\n\nTicketmaster noted that it “usually takes us about an hour to sell through a stadium show,” but the site slowed down some sales while delaying others to “stabilize the systems.” That brought everything to a halt.\n\nThe site seemed to have avoided major problems on Wednesday when pre-sales began for Capital One credit card holders. But the company’s inability to deal with demand for Swift’s tour as well as a lack of tickets to meet further demand essentially killed Friday’s planned sale to the general public.\n\nFans blamed Ticketmaster while others, including members of Congress, heavily criticized the company’s control of the live music industry.\n\n“Ticketmaster’s power in the primary ticket market insulates it from the competitive pressures that typically push companies to innovate and improve their services,” Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote in an open letter to its CEO on Wednesday. “That can result in the types of dramatic service failures we saw this week, where consumers are the ones that pay the price.”\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal echoed Klobuchar’s concerns, tweeting that the tour “is a perfect example of how the Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger harms consumers by creating a near-monopoly.”\n\n“I’ve long urged DOJ to investigate the state of competition in the ticketing industry,” he said. “Consumers deserve better than this anti-hero behavior.”\n\nThe Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into LIve Nation, the owner of Ticketmaster, to look at whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The New York Times first reported the investigation Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been contacting music venues and other ticket market participants in recent months, asking about Live Nation’s practices and industry dynamics, the Times added.\n\nThe Justice Department and Live Nation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAs goes Swift, so goes the music industry\n\nTaylor Swift kicks off her new tour next March. It hits 52 stadiums across the US. Terry Wyatt/Getty Images\n\nThe backlash also highlighted the enormity of Swift’s popularity\n\nThe pop star has had countless hits over her career, built up an ultra-loyal following of fans — better known as “Swifties” — and recently became the first artist ever to simultaneously claim all top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 following the release of her latest album, “Midnights,” which came out last month.\n\nHer Eras Tour — which kicks off in Glendale, Arizona on March 17 and wraps up in Los Angeles on August 9 — is hitting 52 stadiums across the US.\n\nTicketmaster noted on Thursday that more than two million tickets were sold Tuesday for Swift’s upcoming tour — the most ever for an artist in a single day. The company also said that demand for tickets to the Eras Tour was twice that of 2022’s top five tours and the Super Bowl combined.\n\n“Based on the volume of traffic to our site, Taylor would need to perform over 900 stadium shows (almost 20x the number of shows she is doing),” Ticketmaster wrote on Thursday. “That’s a stadium show every single night for the next 2.5 years.”\n\nTickets for Swift’s upcoming tour also resulted in astronomical prices on ticket resale sites, with some tickets being listed for tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSince her debut album in 2006, Swift has also built herself into a cultural icon with immense influence to move the needle over issues in the industry. She has taken on music streaming services like Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music regarding artist pay and is currently re-recording her songs to reclaim ownership of her masters.\n\nIn many aspects, as goes Swift, so goes the music industry.\n\nSerona Elton, professor of music industry at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, further explained Swift’s popularity by noting her success in both music sales and touring. Most music is now consumed via streaming, she said, which is more popular among younger generations who skew slightly female.\n\n“The demographic group that is driving the highest percentage of music consumption sees themselves in her, and closely relates to what she sings about,” she said.\n\n– CNN’s Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/media/justin-timberlake-music-catalog-sale/index.html", "title": "Justin Timberlake sells his entire music catalog | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJustin Timberlake sold his entire song catalog to a Blackstone-backed management company, joining a wave of recent mega stars who are selling the rights to their music for big bucks.\n\nLondon-based firm Hipgnosis Song Management announced Thursday the purchase of all the singer’s copyrights on tracks he wrote or co-wrote – a total of around 200 songs, according to Hipgnosis CEO Merck Mercuriadis. Among JT’s No. 1 hits now under their control include “SexyBack,” “Can’t Stop the Feeling” and “Mirrors.”\n\nThe dollar figure behind the deal has not been disclosed, but people familiar with the matter have it valued upwards of $100 million, according to the The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTimberlake’s music collection spans over 20 years. The singer found fame in 1995 as a member of boy band phenomenon NSYNC. Following the international breakout success of the group, Timberlake launched a solo career that has included five studio albums and 40 singles.\n\nThe sale took over a year to close, according to Mercuriadis, and is part of a rising trend of megastars selling their music catalogs who include the likes of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and Stevie Nicks. At 41 years old, however, Timberlake is younger than the other musical icons inking deals.\n\n“A lot of the artists that are selling their catalogs are getting to a point in their lives where they are planning their estates, sort of planning for the future and they are at a point in their lives where it makes sense to sell their music to provide for their families,” Hannah Karp, editorial director at Billboard told CNN.\n\nTimberlake is not alone among younger stars getting immediate payouts for their younger work with Hipgnosis. The Chainsmokers, an electronic music hit maker duo, sold their catalog to the firm in 2019, and Shakira struck a deal with Hipgnosis in January.\n\n“In the case of those younger songwriters, they’re looking to de-risk their future,” Mercuriadis told CNN Business. “They’re looking to be put in a position where they can make music for pure purposes going forward based on what they want to do, as opposed to what they have to do for money.”\n\nOther artists who have made deals with Hipgnosis include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Journey, Blondie and Neil Young.\n\n“I am excited to be partnering with Merck and Hipgnosis – he values artists and their creative work and has always been a strong supporter of songwriters and storytelling,” said Timberlake in a press release Thursday. “I look forward to entering this next chapter.”\n\nThe deal covers Timberlake’s publishing rights only, so only songs that he had a hand in writing are included in the deal. While Timberlake has written or co-written many of the songs that have brought him solo success – and several songs for other artists such as Rihanna and Madonna – the same is not true for a large chunk of NSYNC’s musical catalog. That means hits like “Bye Bye Bye” lie outside the scope of the Hipgnosis deal.\n\nThe purchase was made on behalf of Hipgnosis Songs Capital, a $1 billion partnership between Hipgnosis Song Management and funds managed by private equity firm Blackstone (BGB). The fund makes profit off of purchases such as Timberlake’s music through movies, television, streaming, cover music and performances.\n\nBlackstone declined to comment on the acquisition.\n\nHipgnosis, created by legendary music manager Mercuriadis who has managed artists like Beyonce, listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2018. Since then, the company has been on a steady music buying spree in a quest to establish songs as an asset class, offering huge payouts for ownership of some of the biggest tracks of all time.\n\n“Justin’s incredible catalogue will join other amazing works at Hipgnosis which we know will serve as a great steward of his work,” David Lande and Mitch Tenzer of Ziffren Brittenham LLP, Timberlake’s lawyers, said in the press release.\n\nThat Timberlake’s lineup joins a group of highly selective, top tier assets held by Hipgnosis is the whole point, says the firm.\n\n“These are not only some of the most culturally important songs and extraordinarily successful songs of the last 25 years, but they’re going to continue to be so for decades and decades to come,” said Mercuriadis. “I want Justin to be proud to be standing next to Nile Rodgers, and I want Nile Rodgers to be proud to be standing next to Neil Young, and I want Neil Young to be proud to be standing next to Chrissie Hynde, and I want Chris Hynde to be proud to be standing next to Timbaland.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/media/taylor-swift-tickets-resale-market/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift tickets listed for thousands after millions flood ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTaylor Swift fans were seeing red on Tuesday when Ticketmaster was overwhelmed by demand as pre-sales for the singer’s new tour went online.

They can also buy the childhood home of late frontman Kurt Cobain, complete with his mattress.\n\nCobain’s mother, Wendy O’Connor, is putting the tired, 1.5-story bungalow two hours southwest of Seattle on the market this week.\n\nTo help sell it, the family is offering a glimpse into the early life of its tortured and talented son through photos shot at the house, including one of a chocolate-frosted birthday cake for Kurt and a shot of a teenage Cobain smiling, guitar in hand, in his messy room.\n\nThe home, last assessed at less than $67,000, is being listed for $500,000. It’s a short walk from a riverfront park dedicated to Cobain’s memory, and the family said it would welcome a partnership to make the home into a museum. His room still has the stencil-like band names — Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin — he reportedly put on the walls, as well as the holes he put in them.\n\n“We’ve decided to sell the home to create a legacy for Kurt, and yes, there are some mixed feelings since we have all loved the home and it carries so many great memories,” Cobain’s sister, Kim Cobain, said in an emailed statement. “But our family has moved on from Washington, and (we) feel it’s time to let go of the home.”\n\nThe house, a 1923 structure with dingy carpeting, water-stained wooden shingles on some interior walls, and a recent coat of yellow paint, is on East 1st Street in Aberdeen, a gritty and struggling former timber town at the mouth of the Chehalis River near the southwest Washington coast.\n\nCobain’s parents bought it in 1969, when Kurt was 2. He lived there until they separated when he was 9, and again with his mom during his later teen years.\n\nThe heroin-addicted Cobain committed suicide in Seattle in 1994, at age 27, after a meteoric career that popularized the Pacific Northwest’s heavy, muddy “grunge” rock. The last of Nirvana’s three studio albums, “In Utero,” came out in September 1993, and Universal Music Group has released a re-mastered version and a “super deluxe” box set.\n\nCobain described his early childhood in Aberdeen as happy. As author Charles R. Cross noted in his Cobain biography, “Heavier Than Heaven,” he would ride his bike around the small yard and pound on a set of Mickey Mouse drums his parents bought him.\n\nIn one event that entered family lore, Cobain’s father, Don, trapped a rat in a garbage can in the garage. Don tried to spear it with a broomstick, but the rodent clambered up the handle, over Don’s shoulder to the ground and across Kurt’s toes to safety — prompting endless laughter from the 5-year-old.\n\nBut his parents’ divorce scarred him deeply. At one point, he scrawled “I hate Mom, I hate Dad” on his bedroom wall, Cross wrote.\n\n“It’s a place where he had very fond memories, but it’s the house where his parents got divorced,” Cross said in an interview. “He couldn’t wait to get away, but it’s a place that helped shape who he became.”\n\nThe home was last lived in by a family friend four years ago. According to The Agency, the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based luxury real estate firm marketing the property, it features the dining room table and hutch from when Cobain lived there. Cobain’s mattress is tucked away in a musty upstairs crawl space.\n\nCobain lived in about 20 houses in his life, Cross said, and this isn’t the first one offered for sale based on its connection to rock history.\n\nIn 2002, an Oregon couple bought a home in nearby Montesano for $42,500. When they learned that Cobain had lived there with his father from 11 to 15, they sold it for $210,000.\n\n———\n\nJohnson can be reached at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/business/ticketmaster-taylor-swift-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "More than two dozen Taylor Swift fans sue Ticketmaster | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDon’t mess with Swifties.\n\nMore than two dozen Taylor Swift fans are suing Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. for “unlawful conduct” in the pop star’s chaotic tour sale, claiming the ticketing giant violated antitrust laws, among others.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in a California court on Friday, alleges Ticketmaster and its parent company were anti-competitive, imposing higher prices on fans in the presale, sale and resale market. It claims Ticketmaster forces concertgoers to exclusively use its site and controlled all registration and access to Swift’s “The Eras Tour.”\n\nThe Swifties are seeking a penalty of $2,500 for each violation, which could add up, based on the millions of angered fans who did not receive tickets.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that since Ticketmaster has agreements with the large stadiums in the tour, Swift “has no choice” but to work with Ticketmaster due to the size of her fan base. It also alleges that Ticketmaster profits off the resale of tickets in the secondary market by adding a service fee to its fan-to-fan exchange.\n\n“Ticketmaster is a monopoly that is only interested in taking every dollar it can from a captive public,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nPre-sale tickets for “The Eras Tour” frustrated Swift fans across the country in a debacle that stayed in the headlines for weeks. In November, “Verified Fans” were sent a presale code — but when sales began, heavy demand snarled the website and millions of Swifties could not get their hands on a ticket. Presale tickets for Capital One card holders brought similar frustration — and then Ticketmaster canceled sales to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demand” and “insufficient remaining ticket inventory.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the company “intentionally and purposely mislead TaylorSwiftTix presale ticket holders by providing codes to 1.4 million ‘verified fans,’” despite the shortage of seats. Ticketmaster said more than two million tickets were sold on the first day of sales for her upcoming tour — the most ever sold for an artist in a single day.\n\n“Millions of fans waited up to eight hours and were unable to purchase tickets as a result of insufficient ticket releases,” the lawsuit said. “Ticketmaster intentionally provided codes when it could not satisfy demands.”\n\nThe 26 Swifties suing the ticketing company are located across the country, from Utah to North Carolina. CNN has reached out to Ticketmaster for comment. Jennifer Kinder, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case, said it is waiting acceptance by the clerk.\n\nTaylor Swift spoke out in a heartfelt post about the ticketing “mistakes,” writing on Instagram that there were a “multitude of reasons why people had such a hard time” getting tickets, and said the experience was “excruciating” for her to watch.\n\nIn a blog post that has since been taken down, Ticketmaster said its “Verified Fans” system, a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots by giving presale codes to individuals, couldn’t keep up with the intense demand. Roughly 3.5 million people signed up for the program to buy Swift tickets, its “largest registration in history.” That unprecedented demand, combined with a “staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes” drove “unprecedented traffic” to its site, Ticketmaster said, and, essentially, broke it.\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Swift and her fans for the “terrible experience” some had trying to purchase tickets and said it would work to “shore up our tech for the new bar that has been set by demand” for Swift’s tour.\n\nThe ticketing debacle drew the ire of several lawmakers, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, who wrote an open letter to Ticketmaster’s CEO, saying she has “serious concerns” about the company’s operations.\n\nIn addition, the Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation, a source told CNN, to determine whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing.\n\nLive Nation responded Saturday in a statement posted to its website, saying it “takes its responsibilities under the antitrust laws seriously” and “does not engage in behaviors that could justify antitrust litigation, let alone orders that would require it to alter fundamental business practices.”\n\n– CNN’s Frank Pallotta and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/media/ticketmaster-apology-taylor-swift-tickets/index.html", "title": "Ticketmaster apologizes to Taylor Swift and her fans for ticketing ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Taylor Swift and her fans late Friday night after a ticketing debacle this week that made it difficult for consumers to buy tickets to the pop star’s new tour.\n\n“We want to apologize to Taylor and all of her fans — especially those who had a terrible experience trying to purchase tickets,” the ticketing site said in the blog post.\n\nThe company added that it strives to make ticket buying “as easy as possible,” but that “hasn’t been the case for many people trying to buy tickets” to Swift’s tour, which kicks off March 17 and will have 52 concerts in multiple stadiums across the US over five months.\n\nThe company said that it is working to “shore up our tech for the new bar that has been set by demand” for her tour. “Once we get through that, if there are any next steps, updates will be shared accordingly,” it wrote.\n\nThe mea culpa comes after Swift spoke out earlier on Friday about how the situation was “excruciating” for her to watch as it unfolded into chaos.\n\n“I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could,” the singer wrote in an Instagram post on Friday afternoon. “It’s truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.”\n\nSwift added that she would try to “figure out how this situation can be improved moving forward.”\n\nSales for the singer’s new Eras Tour began Tuesday, but overwhelming demand snarled the ticketing site, infuriating countless fans who couldn’t buy tickets.

Two other victims were taken in private vehicles to hospitals.\n\nTakeoff’s death is the latest in a trend that stretches back to 2018. Each year since then, gun violence – whether through robbery or disagreement – has killed at least one rapper who was either already famous or on the cusp of crossover fame.\n\nThe 28-year-old rhymesmith, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had just released a project with his uncle and Migos bandmate, Quavo, titled, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” the album’s name a shoutout to the 1995 debut solo effort from Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon. Quavo and Takeoff had recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, “Unc & Phew.”\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.” On Friday, he tweeted about performing in Miami.\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast, “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”\n\nIn addition to his work with Quavo and Migos, Takeoff released a solo album in 2018, “The Last Rocket,” which hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nFrom left, Takeoff, DJ Mustard and Quavo perform at the BET Awards in Los Angeles in 2019.

Crazy. And in a few second a life is gone, families and friends are left grieving. STOP!”\n\nJournalist Jewel Wicker offered some additional career insight from an interview with Takeoff’s uncle, writing, “Takeoff, the then-kid who convinced his uncle (Quavo) to start rapping then helped change the flow of rap. The undisputed best rapper in Migos (his uncle told me so himself just a few months ago). What a loss.” She further reported Takeoff earned his stage name from his ability to “just launch into his verses and record everything in a single, pristine take.”\n\nFellow writer Jemele Hill added, “I was in college when Biggie and ‘Pac were killed and thought there was no way we’d ever experience anything remotely close to that again.

RIP Takeoff.”\n\nRapper Ja Rule felt similarly, writing, “this s**t has to STOP,” while fellow rap star, Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nRolling Stone Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman tweeted out a 2015 article in which Takeoff spoke of his dedication to his craft.\n\n“You couldn’t tell me I wasn’t going to be who I was,” he said. “I knew I was going to be here.”\n\nTakeoff now joins the list of rappers who were victims of gun violence. Here are some other notable artists killed since 2018:\n\n2018: XXXTentacion\n\nXXXTentacion, seen here in 2017, found fame after going viral on social media.

They were indicted on murder and other charges, and one suspect pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is expected to testify against the other three, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.\n\nThe 20-year-old was wildly popular at the time of his death. He rocketed to fame after his song, “Look at Me,” went viral on social media and SoundCloud in 2016.\n\nHe went on to be featured in XXL magazine’s 2017 Freshman Class alongside other up-and-coming artists. His album “?” premiered at No. 1 when it was released in March 2018, according to Billboard.\n\nThe album’s single “Sad!” peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks on the charts, according to Billboard.\n\nRight after his death, “Sad!” moved from No. 52 to No. 1 on Billboard ‘s Hot 100 chart. The song was the first posthumous No. 1 for a lead soloist since The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” in 1997, according to Billboard.\n\nThe rapper was not without controversy: He was accused of homophobia after telling a story on a podcast of choking and severely beating a cellmate he suspected was gay while they both were housed in a juvenile detention center. He had also been awaiting trial for a domestic violence incident involving his pregnant girlfriend.\n\n2019: Nipsey Hussle\n\nNipsey Hussle was fatally shot in March 2019 near a clothing store he owned.

Holder, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the rapper’s death. According to numerous hip-hop publications, his September sentencing date was postponed to this month.\n\nNipsey had been well-known on the underground circuit, and he was gaining a mainstream following just before his death.\n\nA year earlier, he launched the first Marathon Clothing smart store in Los Angeles. Nipsey also owned The Marathon Agency marketing company, investment firm SC Commercial Ventures and the record labels Proud 2 Pay and All Money In No Money Out Records, according to Press Atlantic Records.\n\nThe 33-year-old was nominated for best rap album during the 2019 Grammys for the only studio album he ever released, “Victory Lap.” He lost to Cardi B.\n\nBeyond his music and businesses, Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips but spoke out against rappers who would boast of purported gang affiliations to stunt or look cool – not because he wished them any violence, but to remind them that for too many young people, joining a gang was about survival.\n\n2020: Pop Smoke\n\nPop Smoke died the month before he was scheduled to go on tour.

The Atlanta Police Homicide Unit had arrest warrants against Leeks for felony murder. Two other men were also taken into custody in connection to the shooting, according to CNN affiliate WXIA-TV.\n\nA week before his death, Von had released his debut studio album, “Welcome to O’Block.” His posthumous sophomore album, “What It Means to Be King,” was released March 4, 2022, and debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, according to Billboard.\n\n2021: Young Dolph\n\nRapper Young performed during the Astroworld Festival on November 9, 2019 in Houston, Texas.

Authorities identified them as Justin Johnson, 23, Shondale Barnett, 27, and Cornelius Smith, 32.\n\nMemphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said additional arrests were possible as the investigation into Young Dolph’s death continues. Citizens’ tips were key in capturing the suspects, she said.\n\nDolph, a Chicago native who grew up in Memphis, released his debut album, “King of Memphis,” in 2016.\n\nHe went on to perform several hits, including “Blue Diamonds” and “RNB” featuring Megan Thee Stallion. His fifth studio album, 2020’s “Rich Slave,” rose to No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIn 2017, he was nearly killed in a shooting incident in Hollywood. He spent weeks hospitalized after sustaining three gunshot wounds.\n\nDolph told The Guardian in a 2018 interview that he wasn’t “a person that lives in fear.” He is survived by two children.\n\n2022: PnB Rock\n\nPnB Rock performs during a 2019 festival in Anaheim. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images/File\n\nThe death of rapper PnB Rock in Los Angeles stunned the hip-hop community but brought up familiar conversations that have been taking place for years.\n\nThe rapper was shot September 12 while eating with his girlfriend at Roscoe’s House of Chicken ‘N Waffles in what appears to be a robbery, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore. Notably, Moore said a picture of the pair’s meal had been posted on Instagram, with the location tagged.\n\nIn September, police announced they had charged three people in connection with the killing, including a father and his minor son, who were charged with murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and second-degree robbery, according to the local prosecutor.

Rappers literally being targeted out there and ppl trying em in broad daylight,” podcast host and entertainer DJ Akademiks tweeted.\n\nPnB Rock previously spoke with Ak about an attempted robbery when he was out with his girlfriend and daughter.

Here, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of God our maker and redeemer.\n\nWith gratitude we remember her unswerving commitment to a high calling over so many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth. With admiration we recall her life-long sense of duty and dedication to her people. With thanksgiving we praise God for her constant example of Christian faith and devotion. With affection we recall her love for her family and her commitment to the causes she held dear.\n\nNow, in silence, let us in our hearts and minds recall our many reasons for thanksgiving, pray for all members of her family, and commend Queen Elizabeth to the care and keeping of almighty God.\n\nA brief silence is kept.\n\nO MERCIFUL God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who hast taught us, by his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.

For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n1 Corinthians 15: 20–26, 53–end\n\nThe choir sings The Psalm\n\nLIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks : so longeth my soul after thee, O God.\n\nMy soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God :\n\nwhen shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\n\nMy tears have been my meat day and night : while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?\n\nNow when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself : for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\n\nIn the voice of praise and thanksgiving : among such as keep holy-day.\n\nWhy art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul : and why art thou so disquieted within me?\n\nPut thy trust in God : for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance.\n\nWords: Psalm 42: 1–7\n\nMusic :Judith Weir CBE, Master of the Queen’s Music (b 1954)\n\ncomposed for this Service\n\nThe Right Honourable Elizabeth Truss MP, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, reads the Second Lesson\n\nLET not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

Here, in St George’s Chapel, where she so often worshipped, we are bound to call to mind someone whose uncomplicated yet profound Christian Faith bore so much fruit. Fruit, in a life of unstinting service to the Nation, the Commonwealth and the wider world, but also (and especially to be remembered in this place) in kindness,concern and reassuring care for her family and friends and neighbours. In the midst of our rapidly changing and frequently troubled world, her calm and dignified presence has given us confidence to face the future, as she did, with courage and with hope. As, with grateful hearts, we reflect on these and all the many other ways in which her long life has been a blessing to us, we pray that God will give us grace to honour her memory by following her example, and that, with our sister Elizabeth, at the last, we shall know the joys of life eternal.\n\nAll remain standing for the Hymn:\n\nAll my hope on God is founded;\n\nHe doth still my trust renew.\n\nMe through change and chance he guideth,\n\nOnly good and only true.\n\nGod unknown,\n\nHe alone\n\nCalls my heart to be his own.\n\nGod’s great goodness aye endureth,\n\nDeep his wisdom, passing thought:\n\nSplendour, light and life attend him,\n\nBeauty springeth out of naught.\n\nEvermore\n\nFrom his store\n\nNew-born worlds rise and adore.\n\nDaily doth th’Almighty giver\n\nBounteous gifts on us bestow;\n\nHis desire our soul delighteth,\n\nPleasure leads us where we go.\n\nLove doth stand\n\nAt his hand;\n\nJoy doth wait on his command.\n\nStill from man to God eternal\n\nSacrifice of praise be done,\n\nHigh above all praises praising\n\nFor the gift of Christ his Son.\n\nChrist doth call\n\nOne and all:\n\nYe who follow shall not fall.\n\nWords: Robert Bridges, OM (1844-1930) based on the German of Joachim Neander (1650-80)\n\nMusic: ‘MICHAEL’ Herbert Howells, CH, CBE (1892-1983)\n\nThe Dean of Windsor gives The Reading.\n\nI SAW a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things;and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\n\nRevelation 21.1–7\n\nThe Rector of Sandringham, the Minister of Crathie Kirk and the Chaplain of the Royal Chapel, Windsor Great Park read the Prayers.\n\nRemember, O Lord, thy servant Elizabeth who has gone before us with the sign of faith, and now rests in sleep. According to thy promises, grant unto her, and\n\nto all who repose in Christ, refreshment, light and peace; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nMerciful Father and Lord of all life, we praise thee that thou hast made us in thine image and that we reflect thy truth and light.We give special thanks for the life of thy daughter Elizabeth, for the mercy she received from thee, and for the example that through her life of service, love and faith, she has set before our eyes. Above all, we rejoice at thy gracious promise to all thy servants, living and departed, that we shall rise again at the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ.We pray that, in due time, we may share with our sister that clearer vision when we shall see thy face in the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nO Father of all, we pray to thee for those whom we love, but see no longer. Grant them peace; let light perpetual shine upon them; and, in thy loving wisdom and almighty power, work in them the good purposes of thy perfect will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nO Lord, support us all the day long of this troublous life, until the shades lengthen and the evening comes, the busy world is hushed, the fever of life is over and our work is done; then Lord, in thy mercy, grant us safe lodging,a holy rest, and peace at the last; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nLord God Almighty, King of creation, bless our King and all Members of the Royal Family. May godliness be their guidance, may sanctity be their strength, may peace on earth be the fruit of their labours, and their joy in heaven thine eternal gift; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Automation booms after COVID", "text": "Associated Press\n\nAsk for a roast beef sandwich at an Arby’s drive-thru east of Los Angeles and you may be talking to Tori — an artificially intelligent voice assistant that will take your order and send it to the line cooks.\n\n“It doesn’t call sick,” says Amir Siddiqi, whose family installed the AI voice at its Arby’s franchise this year in Ontario, California. “It doesn’t get corona. And the reliability of it is great.”\n\nThe pandemic didn’t just threaten Americans’ health when it slammed the U.S. in 2020 -- it may also have posed a long-term threat to many of their jobs.\n\nFaced with worker shortages and higher labor costs, companies are starting to automate service sector jobs that economists once considered safe, assuming that machines couldn’t easily provide the human contact they believed customers would demand.\n\nPast experience suggests that such automation waves eventually create more jobs than they destroy, but that they also disproportionately wipe out less skilled jobs that many low-income workers depend on. Resulting growing pains for the U.S. economy could be severe.\n\nIf not for the pandemic, Siddiqi probably wouldn’t have bothered investing in new technology that could alienate existing employees and some customers. But it’s gone smoothly, he says: “Basically, there’s less people needed but those folks are now working in the kitchen and other areas.”\n\nIdeally, automation can redeploy workers into better and more interesting work, so long as they can get the appropriate technical training, says Johannes Moenius, an economist at the University of Redlands. But although that’s happening now, it’s not moving quickly enough, he says.\n\nWorse, an entire class of service jobs created when manufacturing began to deploy more automation may now be at risk. “The robots escaped the manufacturing sector and went into the much larger service sector,” he says. “I regarded contact jobs as safe. I was completely taken by surprise.”\n\nImprovements in robot technology allow machines to do many tasks that previously required people -- tossing pizza dough, transporting hospital linens, inspecting gauges, sorting goods. The pandemic accelerated their adoption. Robots, after all, can’t get sick or spread disease. Nor do they request time off to handle unexpected childcare emergencies.\n\nEconomists at the International Monetary Fund found that past pandemics had encouraged firms to invest in machines in ways that could boost productivity -- but also kill low-skill jobs. “Our results suggest that the concerns about the rise of the robots amid the COVID-19 pandemic seem justified,” they wrote in a January paper.\n\nThe consequences could fall most heavily on the less-educated women who disproportionately occupy the low- and mid-wage jobs most exposed to automation -- and to viral infections. Those jobs include salesclerks, administrative assistants, cashiers and aides in hospitals and those who take care of the sick and elderly.\n\nEmployers seem eager to bring on the machines. A survey last year by the nonprofit World Economic Forum found that 43% of companies planned to reduce their workforce as a result of new technology. Since the second quarter of 2020, business investment in equipment has grown 26%, more than twice as fast as the overall economy.\n\nThe fastest growth is expected in the roving machines that clean the floors of supermarkets, hospitals and warehouses, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a trade group. The same group also expects an uptick in sales of robots that provide shoppers with information or deliver room service orders in hotels.\n\nRestaurants have been among the most visible robot adopters. In late August, for instance, the salad chain Sweetgreen announced it was buying kitchen robotics startup Spyce, which makes a machine that cooks up vegetables and grains and spouts them into bowls.\n\nIt’s not just robots, either -- software and AI-powered services are on the rise as well. Starbucks has been automating the behind-the-scenes work of keeping track of a store’s inventory. More stores have moved to self-checkout.\n\nScott Lawton, CEO of the Arlington, Virginia-based restaurant chain Bartaco, was having trouble last fall getting servers to return to his restaurants when they reopened during the pandemic.\n\nSo he decided to do without them. With the help of a software firm, his company developed an online ordering and payment system customers could use over their phones. Diners now simply scan a barcode at the center of each table to access a menu and order their food without waiting for a server. Workers bring food and drinks to their tables. And when they’re done eating, customers pay over their phones and leave.\n\nThe innovation has shaved the number of staff, but workers aren’t necessarily worse off. Each Bartaco location — there are 21 — now has up to eight assistant managers, roughly double the pre-pandemic total. Many are former servers, and they roam among the tables to make sure everyone has what they need. They are paid annual salaries starting at $55,000 rather than hourly wages.\n\nTips are now shared among all the other employees, including dishwashers, who now typically earn $20 an hour or more, far higher than their pre-pandemic pay. “We don’t have the labor shortages that you’re reading about on the news,” Lawton says.\n\nThe uptick in automation has not stalled a stunning rebound in the U.S. jobs market -- at least so far.\n\nThe U.S. economy lost a staggering 22.4 million jobs in March and April 2020, when the pandemic gale hit the U.S. Hiring has since bounced back briskly: Employers have brought back 17 million jobs since April 2020. In June, they posted a record 10.1 million job openings and are complaining that they can’t find enough workers.\n\nBehind the hiring boom is a surge in spending by consumers, many of whom got through the crisis in unexpectedly good shape financially -- thanks to both federal relief checks and, in many cases, savings accumulated by working from home and skipping the daily commute.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, expects employers are likely to be scrambling for workers for a long time.\n\nFor one thing, many Americans are taking their time returning to work -- some because they’re still worried about COVID-19 health risks and childcare problems, others because of generous federal unemployment benefits, set to expire nationwide Sept. 6.\n\nIn addition, large numbers of Baby Boom workers are retiring. “The labor market is going to be very, very tight for the foreseeable future,” Zandi says.\n\nFor now, the short-term benefits of the economic snapback are overwhelming any job losses from automation, whose effects tend to show up gradually over a period of years. That may not last. Last year, researchers at the University of Zurich and University of British Columbia found that the so-called jobless recoveries of the past 35 years, in which economic output rebounded from recessions faster than employment, could be explained by the loss of jobs vulnerable to automation.\n\nDespite strong hiring since the middle of last year, the U.S. economy is still 5.3 million jobs short of what it had in February 2020. And Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, calculated last month that 40% of the missing jobs are vulnerable to automation, especially those in food preparation, retail sales and manufacturing.\n\nSome economists worry that automation pushes workers into lower-paid positions. Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University estimated in June that up to 70% of the stagnation in U.S. wages between 1980 and 2016 could be explained by machines replacing humans doing routine tasks.\n\n“Many of the jobs that get automated were at the middle of the skill distribution,” Acemoglu says. “They don’t exist anymore, and the workers that used to perform them are now doing lower-skill jobs.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/14/convention-fight-great-white-isolation-island-news-around-states/112226300/", "title": "Convention fight, Great White: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Republican leader of the state Senate said he used a poor choice of words when he suggested he wanted more people to get infected with the new coronavirus. “It was a poor choice of words on my end,” Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh told the Associated Press, saying he didn’t wish for anyone to become ill. Last week Marsh drew criticism after he suggested more infections meant the state was closer to herd immunity. “I’m not as concerned so much as the number of cases; in fact, quite honestly, I want to see more people because we start reaching an immunity as more people have it and get through it,” Marsh told news outlets. Herd immunity is when enough people have contracted a disease and developed immunity that the virus cannot spread easily. But doctors have cautioned that they don’t yet know if COVID-19 survivors have long-term immunity.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: There were 116 new COVID-19 cases reported across the state Sunday – its highest daily increase so far. There was one new hospitalization and no new deaths reported in Alaska, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The state Department of Health and Social Services said 93 of the new cases involved Alaska residents, and 23 involved nonresidents. The new cases reported Sunday break a previous record set the day before, when the state reported 77 cases. The reason for Sunday’s increase was not immediately clear. It was not known if patients were showing symptoms or how sick they were at the time of testing. Alaska has reported 1,774 cases of COVID-19 statewide, with 847 active cases. There have been 86 people hospitalized as a result of the virus since March, and 17 residents have died.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: More than 60 firefighters with the Phoenix Fire Department have tested positive for the coronavirus. “We have had multiple positive cases in the past week, a truly alarming amount,” P.J. Dean, a spokesman for United Phoenix Firefighters Association, told Phoenix radio station KTAR FM. Phoenix Fire is the nation’s fifth-largest fire department with 60 fire stations serving Arizona’s largest city. As of Tuesday, the department had reported 62 positive COVID-19 cases among firefighters. Another 100 members out of 1,585 are currently quarantined during the testing process, awaiting their results, and seven civilian members have also tested positive. “It’s challenging. In my 25 years of experience, I’ve never seen anything like this,” Dean said. Every third day, city firefighters report to duty for at least 24 hours and share a fire station with a variety of people while sleeping, eating and living together.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 503 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and eight additional deaths related to the new coronavirus. State health officials said the total number of confirmed cases climbed to 28,367. The death toll for the outbreak, which officials began tracking in early March, was 321 on Sunday. The true number of cases in Arkansas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Arkansas’ virus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses to reopen. As of Sunday, there were more than 6,400 active cases in the state, and nearly 21,600 people who had contracted COVID-19 have recovered, according to health officials.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A heat wave brought crowds to the state’s beaches, where people mostly heeded warnings to keep a safe distance from each other as the state grappled with a spike in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations. “It’s a busy day at the beach, but people are spread out, for the most part,” said Chief Jason Young with Orange County Lifeguards. Temperatures soared into the 90s over the weekend in many areas from San Diego north to the San Francisco Bay Area. The rural community of Paicines inland from Monterey recorded a high of 102, the National Weather Service said. Young said lifeguards were educating the public on guidelines to stay about 6 feet apart to help curb the spread of the virus. In Santa Monica, Mercedes Benns said she was relieved to see the majority of people wearing masks in the beachside city. “People are keeping away from each other as best they can,” Benns said. “Everyone’s being respectful.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: UCHealth expects to begin recruiting 1,000 patients at high risk of contracting COVID-19 to participate in a vaccine trial in the next few weeks. Researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and UCHealth on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver will be testing the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine to establish its efficacy and safety. It is the first COVID-19 trial launched in Colorado and the first for UCHealth, spokeswoman Kelly Tracer said. Unlike traditional vaccines that expose participants to a small amount of virus, this vaccine focuses on the genetic code of the coronavirus and its spike protein, said Dr. Thomas Campbell, an infectious disease doctor at the CU School of Medicine and University of Colorado Hospital. The recruitment period will last about two months, and the call will go out through UCHealth’s My Health Connection patient portal.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Several state parks closed their gates before noon Sunday after quickly reaching their visitor limits. The state has reduced by half the number of people allowed in the parks during the coronavirus pandemic to allow for social distancing. By Sunday morning, at least eight parks, including Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme and Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, were already at capacity, NBC Connecticut reports. The state’s coronavirus transmission rate is among the lowest in the country, and the state has reported few virus deaths in recent days. At its peak April 20, Connecticut recorded 204 coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: A popular Rehoboth Beach deli has temporarily closed after two employees were possibly exposed to individuals who may have the coronavirus. Owner Warren S. Rosenfeld announced on Facebook on Monday afternoon that he would be closing Rosenfeld’s Jewish Deli for at least 10 days. He did not say in the post if the coronavirus exposure came from other employees, customers or friends or family of the staffers. “Two staff members may have been exposed to others exhibiting signs of COVID,” the post said. “The staff no longer feels comfortable there until COVID testing of all staff members is completed, and results received.” Rosenfeld said the restaurant was closing “even though those others have yet to receive definitive word on their condition.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has declared beekeepers to be essential workers during the coronavirus outbreak, WUSA-TV reports. Spring and summer is when beehives will “swarm,” meaning a queen will take half the hive to make a new hive. If the swarm isn’t collected by a beekeeper, the new hive can come to settle in residential backyards, attics, crawlspaces or other potentially ruinous areas. And that can create a stinging, scary nuisance. Beekeepers respond to swarms and carefully transplant them to designated areas such as community gardens, rooftops and even embassies in Washington. American honeybee colonies have bounced back after a bad year, an annual beekeeping survey finds. Beekeepers only lost 22.2% of their colonies this past winter, lower than the average of 28.6%, according to the Bee Informed Partnership’s annual survey of thousands of beekeepers. It was the second-smallest winter loss in 14 years of surveying.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Officials shut down two strip clubs as part of a statewide crackdown on violators of an emergency order that forced bars to close in the face of rising coronavirus cases. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation suspended the licenses of Le Palace Otown in Orlando and Show N Tail The Legend in Panama City Beach, saying patrons didn’t observe social distancing guidelines. In both cases, the orders said DBPR had the authority to suspend a license if there is an “immediate health to the public health, safety or welfare.” In the case of Le Palace Otown, state regulators said, the bar was in violation of the terms of both the governor’s executive order for Phase 2 as well as the DBPR emergency order two weeks ago shutting bars back down. The business failed to observe social distancing guidelines, the order said. Show N Tail required customers to pay a cover charge, which entitled them to a “free” alcoholic beverage and to “observe any adult entertainment,” according to its suspension order.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of people in Georgia who have died after contracting the coronavirus has reached 3,001, according to data released Sunday by the state Department of Public Health. Confirmed cases and hospitalizations have been rising sharply in the state over the past few weeks. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has been locked in a battle with local officials over whether they have the power to implement virus restrictions that go beyond his orders. Kemp says no, but local governments across the state are doing it anyway, with several cities including Atlanta implementing mask requirements and other restrictions. More than 2,500 new confirmed cases of the virus were reported Sunday, according to the health department. That brings the total number of confirmed cases to nearly 117,000, though experts say official counts likely only capture a fraction of those who have been infected. As of Sunday, 2,512 people with the virus were hospitalized in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials organizing events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II say the coronavirus has not derailed the plans. Planners expect to follow through with the schedule of Victory over Japan Day, or V-J Day, events Aug. 29 through Sept. 2 as uncertainty remains about COVID-19 health restrictions, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The theme of the events is “Salute Their Service, Honor Their Hope,” and the schedule includes several warplane flyovers and a ceremony on or next to the battleship Missouri, on which the U.S. accepted Japan’s unconditional surrender Sept. 2, 1945. Tony Vericella, executive director of the 75th World War II Commemoration Committee in Hawaii, said that as of last week, more than 30 World War II veterans from outside Hawaii and their family members had committed to attending the events in Oahu. Vericella said the participation of veterans and others from the continental U.S. relies on the state lifting a 14-day self-quarantine for out-of-state travelers, which would be replaced with a mandate for visitors to undergo COVID-19 screening tests prior to arriving.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling rejecting his request to put on hold a court order forcing the state to count online signatures for an initiative backers hope to get on the November ballot. The Republican governor announced the decision not long after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his request last week. “We will continue our efforts to preserve the integrity of Idaho’s duly enacted laws and to prevent the disruption to our upcoming elections that this decision will cause,” Little said in a statement. Reclaim Idaho, a group that backs initiatives, in the lawsuit filed last month said that Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March due to the coronavirus pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature gathering.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Health officials have put a mobile COVID-19 testing station outside a suburban Chicago high school as the area sees an uptick in cases among younger residents, a trend that has happened elsewhere in the country. The site, outside Lake Zurich High School’s Performing Arts Center, operated Sunday and will be open next weekend, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Lake County Health Department said there’s been a spike in coronavirus cases of people under age 30 while cases among the general population remained steady. Multiple cases were reported among participants attending the first day of a sports camp at Lake Zurich High School and other recent social gatherings. On Sunday, Illinois public health officials announced 954 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 20 deaths across the state. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 153,916 cases and 7,187 deaths. The state reported 38,894 tests Sunday with an average seven-day positive rate of 3%.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After announcing plans to reopen as scheduled, Washington Township Schools said Monday that it will not bring students back into classrooms to start the new school year due to an increasing number of coronavirus cases. The school district’s board voted Monday to continue with virtual classes, “while coronavirus indicators increase.” Washington Township serves more than 11,000 students on Indianapolis’ northside. Just last week, the board had approved a plan that would reopen its classrooms for in-person instruction with requirements for masks, social distancing and other safety measures. Then, cases in Indiana started to increase. At the end of last week, the state saw the highest numbers of new coronavirus cases since early May and increases in the percent of COVID-19 tests coming back positive. In a statement released Monday, the board said it had to do what it believed was best for its students and staff members.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s gross domestic product fell 3.5% in the first quarter, led by a hurting arts and entertainment sector of the economy, according to a new report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Iowa City’s Englert Theatre – one of the oldest entertainment venues in the state – estimated a loss of $385,213 between March through May, a figure that represents approximately 20% of the nonprofit’s typical gross annual revenues, as the coronavirus outbreak forced venues and other businesses to shut their doors. In response, the Englert joined the National Independent Venue Association, a collection of roughly 2,000 performance venues across the nation created to urge Congress to give more support to the ailing industry. NIVA representatives say they expect to see as much as 90% of businesses within its membership close permanently by the end of the year.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The Kansas State Fair Board voted Monday to cancel this year’s fair amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its reversal came a week after the board initially voted to continue with the fair, sparking concern from vendors and the community about the COVID-19 pandemic. “We appreciate the thoughtful consideration you gave to open the fair as safely as possible. After that, we heard from a number of vendors who were genuinely concerned,” Kansas State Fair general manager Robin Jennison said. About half the vendors had canceled amid worries about delays with travel quarantines, difficulties in putting crews together and cancellations of other fairs. Jennison said last week that it was beginning to appear the fair would be financially worse off going forward than not having it. The organization cannot operate in the red. The board is still interested in finding a way to safely hold livestock and 4H events.\n\nKentucky\n\nLeitchfield: Grayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins has a message for the rest of the Bluegrass State: Wear a mask. You don’t want to go through what he’s going through. Chaffins had been in bed for the past six days, he wrote in a lengthy Facebook post published Sunday, after contracting COVID-19 recently. He’s still fighting to recover, he wrote. “I consider myself a tough guy,” Chaffins wrote. “But I am telling you that It brought me down QUICK and there is nothing I can do about it.” Two of his family members have had mild symptoms, he said, but he was hit harder. The family returned to Leitchfield on July 4 after a vacation out west, where he believes he contracted the virus, and while it started with just a mild fever, Chaffins said his symptoms worsened as the week went on. Chaffins said his sheriff’s department isn’t going to enforce Gov. Andy Beshear’s mask mandate, but those in the community should still wear masks as a courtesy to others.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: The state’s public school students, teachers and adults in grades three through 12 will be required to wear masks as part of the Department of Education’s minimum safety standards it will present to the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on Tuesday. The education department and BESE are required to produce the standards by a new law passed by the Legislature on June 30 and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said the new law provided BESE with the authority to enact mask mandates and other standards. “I really feel good about our plan,” Brumley said Saturday. “It’s something as a team we’ve spent countless hours to get right and hand in hand with the Louisiana Department of Health (and others). We wanted to give systems a road map, but at the same time we wanted to provide some degree of flexibility.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: An island that once served as a quarantine site during the Spanish flu is being marketed as a refuge from the coronavirus for a cool $250,000 a week, plus expenses. Portland entrepreneur Noah Gordon planned to host high-end weddings on the 12 acres he purchased for $4.5 million on House Island. Now he’s marketing it as a coronavirus-free safety zone. House Island sits just offshore, between South Portland and Peaks Island. And it’s a quick helicopter ride from the mainland. Staff at the island will follow health protocols ensuring a “safe haven bubble of privacy, safety and security where guests can socialize, party and play,” according to promotional materials. “It’s not that safety is the new luxury. Safety is luxury,” Gordon said. The island was the site of the city’s inspection and quarantine station between 1907 and 1937.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: More restaurants and bars are closing their doors as staffers continue to test positive for COVID-19. On Saturday, the Blu Crabhouse and Raw Bar announced it would close for business until further notice after a member of its staff contracted the disease. Buxy’s Salty Dog Saloon and Dry Dock 28 also shut down at 7 p.m. Saturday and will remain closed until Wednesday. The two are the latest Ocean City establishments to close down until further notice citing concerns of the virus spreading. On Friday, Fish Tales, the Longboard Cafe and the Purple Moose Saloon announced they would close with multiple staffers testing positive. The Original Crabcake Factory in Ocean City has also discontinued its bar and indoor dining services until further notice following a violation of social distancing and face mask policy. The Crab Bag and Bull on the Beach announced indoor dining will be discontinued.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gyms are welcoming back members and the iconic duck boat tours are rolling out again as the city enters the third phase of its coronavirus economic restart. Boston began Phase 3 on Monday, a week after most of the rest of Massachusetts, allowing museums, movie theaters, historical sites and gyms to reopen with certain restrictions. The New England Aquarium and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum are among those expected to reopen this week. Boston Duck Tours were also restarting Monday. The company said it’s limiting the number of people on the duck boats so guests can socially distance and requiring face masks for staff and guests. Pat Smith, co-founder of a South Boston gym that reopens Monday, told The Boston Globe that most of its members have said they feel safe to return to working out in person. “People are ready to roll, and get back to a little bit of normalcy,” said Smith of Lifted Fitness.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Protesters who said they’re concerned about the coronavirus blocked a driveway used by buses Monday on the first day of summer classes in the city’s school district. Protesters held signs and placed tree branches on the ground to try to prevent buses from picking up children. WWJ-AM quoted two bus drivers as saying they quit on the spot. “I’m not going back until this pandemic is defeated. There is no safe way to return to school while this virus is spreading uncontained,” teacher Benjamin Royal said. It wasn’t immediately clear how many students, if any, couldn’t get to school because of the protest. Detroit Public Schools Community District said it’s offering in-person or online morning classes in 26 schools, through Aug. 6. Students and staff are required to wear masks. The district said classrooms would be limited to 10 to 15 students per teacher.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: People who qualify to be designated as “essential caregivers” will be allowed to visit family members in senior living centers under new guidance Friday from the state health department that loosens restrictions that have kept loved ones under a near-lockdown for four months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Long-term care facilities such as nursing homes will be able to designate family members or others as essential caregivers so they can resume visits with precautions, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said. The tight restrictions imposed in mid-March were “difficult but very essential” to protect residents and staff, but they came with their own costs in loneliness, quality of life and health risks resulting from that social isolation, Malcolm told reporters. “People are suffering, and they’re dying from COVID-19, but also from loneliness,” said Cheryl Hennan, the state ombudsman at the Office of Long-Term Care at the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students are scheduled to return to school in August amid rising cases of COVID-19 in the state, but campus life will be a lot different from what many are used to. At Mississippi State, temperature check-in kiosks will be scattered around campus. Students who live in dorms will be required to log their temperature every 24 hours and fill out a health questionnaire. Employees and day students will be required to check temperatures at home and take a screening survey before arriving on campus. At Mississippi State and the University of Mississippi, all members of the community will be required to wear masks inside and out of the classroom, where class sizes will be reduced by 50%. “While we remain focused on preserving the on-campus experience, COVID-19 has forced us to rethink everything we do,” University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce said in a letter to the campus community in late June.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge has rejected a motion that would have immediately made it easier for Missourians to vote with a mail-in ballot during the coronavirus pandemic. Cole County Judge Jon Beetem denied the motion Friday for a preliminary injunction sought by the Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters, the Jefferson City News-Tribune reports. At issue is how voting will work as public health officials urge people to social distance to avoid spreading COVID-19. The lawsuit seeks to allow all Missourians to cast absentee ballots without notarization in 2020. Under a new law, people considered at risk of the coronavirus – those age 65 and older, living in a long-term care facility or with certain existing health problems – can vote absentee without having their ballot notarized. The Missouri Supreme Court sent the lawsuit back for further review, ruling last month that Beetem was wrong to dismiss it. Beetem said the groups presented no new arguments.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County in central Montana has issued a public health order limiting indoor events to 250 people and outdoor events to 500. The Cascade City-County Health Department issued the order Friday that also requires organizers of events with 100 to 500 people to submit an event packet for approval before the event can take place. Officials say the restrictions are reasonable and intended to protect the community from the coronavirus. Two more deaths due to the coronavirus were reported Monday in Montana, bringing the new statewide total to 32 people who have died because of the respiratory illness. The state reported 85 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing its total to 1,843. Officials have attributed the increase to more testing being done statewide but also have said people are not as vigilant about protecting themselves from the respiratory illness as they once were.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s three largest counties plan to send ballot request forms to every voter before this fall’s general election, but it’s not yet clear whether those forms will be sent statewide as they were before the primary. Officials in Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties say they are planning to send out the ballot-request forms because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and because it will help them plan for the election. Nebraska also has 11 rural counties that routinely vote entirely by mail. Heavy use of mail-in ballots during the May primary helped the state set a record for turnout when more than 471,000 people voted. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen told The Omaha World-Herald he hasn’t decided whether to send out ballot request forms to every registered voter in the state. Gov. Pete Ricketts doesn’t think it is necessary to send out the forms this fall, spokesman Taylor Gage said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s unemployment benefits call center in Las Vegas has closed for cleaning after officials said an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. The state Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation announced Sunday that the unidentified person was self-quarantined and that there was no immediate risk to the public because the facility had been closed to outsiders since mid-March. Agency official Kimberly Gaa said claims usually handled by the southern Nevada office will be routed to the unemployment insurance call center in Carson City, and the closure will remain in effect until coronavirus protocols are met. Officials say the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance system and call center aren’t affected. People filing regular jobless claims were advised to use online services as much as possible during non-peak hours such as early mornings, nights or weekends.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Nashua’s face-covering ordinance and the governor’s declaration of a state of emergency because of the coronavirus will stand while they’re being challenged in court, a judge ruled Monday. Andrew Cooper, a Nashua resident, had filed a request for a preliminary injunction as part of his lawsuit seeing to end Gov. Chris Sununu’s emergency declaration and the city’s rules requiring members of the public ages 10 and older to wear face masks when entering any business, work site or government building. He argued that Sununu lacked the authority to make the declaration because “there is no ‘emergency’ in New Hampshire,” a claim that Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge Jacalyn Colburn said defied common sense. “As anyone not living in a cave for the past few months would know, the State, the Country, and the entire world are in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic event,” she wrote in denying the motion.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday that the state would lift the 50% capacity limit that has been enforced on NJ Transit and private carrier buses, trains, light rail and Access Link. That order has been in effect since March to help mitigate the spread of the virus but will be lifted Wednesday at 8 p.m. Murphy also said face coverings will be required at all indoor stations and outdoor stations where social distancing isn’t possible, as well as in the transit vehicles. “We are seeing increases in ridership that are beginning to approach 50% of the stated maximum capacity of these vehicles, and we want to ensure that people can get to their jobs and that the system continues operating as efficiently as possible,” Murphy said. He said that in a “perfect world” there would be more tunnels under the Hudson River so more trains could run and keep the capacity lower.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State health officials reported an additional 262 COVID-19 cases and two more confirmed deaths Sunday. That increased the statewide death toll to 545 and the confirmed cases total to 15,028. The New Mexico Department of Health said 111 of the additional cases were in Bernalillo County, the state’s largest county that includes the Albuquerque metro area. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. On Saturday, state authorities ordered a Walmart Supercenter in Las Cruces to close after four employees tested positive for the coronavirus in a three-week span. The store employs more than 400 people. The state Environment Department now is requiring the store to test all of its workers and thoroughly disinfect the building.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Certain nursing homes can allow visitors – with restrictions – starting Wednesday as the state eases a ban aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable elderly residents. Only nursing homes and long-term care facilities without any new coronavirus cases among residents and staffers in the past 28 days can allow limited visits, state Department of Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said. The department said the state’s policy follows federal guidance and is limited to nursing homes without staffing shortages that have tested all residents. Health department spokeswoman Jill Montag said about 150 of the more than 600 nursing homes in the state could qualify to open up to visitors. Roughly 500 nursing homes had reported COVID-19 cases among staffers in June, according to recently released data from the state, which doesn’t release data about the number of cases at individual nursing homes.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s witness requirement for people casting mail-in absentee ballots is unconstitutional during the COVID-19 pandemic, voters said Friday while suing to have it suspended during the emergency. State law says an absentee voter must fill out a traditional absentee ballot in the presence of two adults, who sign the sealed envelope confirming the voter’s identity. The law was amended last month for the rest of 2020 to reduce the number of witnesses to one. It’s based on the idea that older people and those at higher risk to contract the coronavirus are isolated in their homes. But even one witness is too many, according to four individuals who sued in Wake County Superior Court with help from the American Civil Liberties Union and a New York law firm. They said they have preexisting conditions that could otherwise force them to endanger their lives by seeking a witness.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDickinson: Metal band Great White has apologized for performing at an outdoor concert where the crowd didn’t wear masks despite the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. The band drew criticism on social media after the performance Thursday night as part of the “First on First: Dickinson Summer Nights” concert series in Dickinson, in the southwest of the state. Spin magazine posted video showing the crowd packed in and not wearing face masks. “We have had the luxury of hindsight and we would like to apologize to those who disagreed with our decision to fulfill our contractual agreement. The Promoter and staff were nothing but professional and assured us of the safety precautions,” Great White said in a statement Saturday. Although North Dakota health officials recommend social distancing and wearing masks when possible, there is no legal requirement to do so in the state, and Great White said the band nevertheless was “not in a position to enforce the laws.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: As infections have surged across the region, local public health officials have expanded their pandemic teams of contact tracers, with help from the state, and are running them seven days a week to track the coronavirus. In the city of Springdale, Health Commissioner Matt Clayton recruited Spanish speakers already known in the community to work as contact tracers. The Cincinnati Health Department brought aboard 10 employees of the Ohio Department of Health to supplement the 30 staffers and volunteers already contract tracing. Graduate students at Wright State University’s public health program are helping Warren County’s health department with contact tracing. Most citizens have understood the contact tracers’ task and have cooperated, the public health officials said last week, although about 10% to 15% of people have refused.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Monday reported 510 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and noted the state’s first death of a child from the disease. Officials at Fort Sill Army Post in southwest Oklahoma confirmed a 13-year-old dependent of a service member stationed there tested positive for COVID-19 and died Friday at Comanche County Memorial Hospital. “Our entire Lawton Fort Sill community is deeply saddened,” Maj Gen. Ken Kamper, commanding general of Fort Sill, said in a statement. The family members are currently in isolation at their home at Fort Sill, officials said. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported an additional two deaths Monday, bringing the statewide death toll to 424. The total number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in Oklahoma now stands at 20,745, although the actual number of cases is likely much higher since many people haven’t been tested, and some with the disease don’t show symptoms.\n\nOregon\n\nWoodburn: The city is suing Marion County over a COVID-19 isolation shelter at a Super 8 Hotel. The lawsuit was filed Thursday following a directive by the Woodburn City Council. Attorneys for the city seek a court order against Marion County to cease shelter operations. City officials maintain that the shelter is operating in violation of the Woodburn’s Zoning & Development Ordinance and say it poses a public safety risk to surrounding neighborhoods. The hotel is located across from a large facility with senior-restricted residences, a nursing home and a medical facility. Marion County officials said they would operate the shelter starting July 1 for nine months. As a condition of the county moving into phase 2 of reopening June 19, county health officials were required to find a facility for COVID-19 positive patients with mild symptoms who don’t have anywhere to isolate. The county chose the hotel in Woodburn – a coronavirus hot spot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A proposal to construct plastic barriers around school bus drivers as a COVID-19 mitigation tactic was shot down by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, a sign of one particular challenge – among many – schools face as they plan for a fall reopening. The state Education Department told districts last month each can restart in-person instruction with a plan that’s approved by the local school board, made public and provided to the state. But Education Secretary Pedro Rivera warned that transportation would be a difficult problem to solve. The great majority of the state’s public school districts contract with private companies to provide bus transportation, and those companies have difficulty finding and keeping enough drivers in the best of times, said Mike Berk with the Pennsylvania School Bus Association, a trade group.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Parking lots at every state beach in Rhode Island reached capacity Sunday as the temperature soared to 93 degrees, the state Department of Environmental Management reported. Capacity at the lots has been limited to ensure social distancing on the sand. Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Blood Center has put out a call for donors because even though the need for blood has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels as hospitals resume elective and non-critical surgeries, donor participation has not. About 50% of the region’s blood supply comes from mobile blood drives, but from March through June, most of those were canceled because of the pandemic. And even though blood drives have resumed, they are not being scheduled at pre-pandemic levels, blood center spokesperson Kara LeBlanc said in a statement. In addition, about one-fifth of the people who make appointments to donate blood do not show up.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A hospital system is suspending elective surgeries due to increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients that officials say are straining staff and other resources. Effective Tuesday, officials with Roper St. Francis in Charleston said procedures that aren’t time-sensitive would be put on hold across its four facilities to free up staff for an “unrelenting flood” of patients needing treatment for COVID-19. In all, 131 patients who had become ill after contracting the coronavirus were being treated at the hospital’s facilities, representing more than a third of all of Roper’s inpatient care. Emergency surgeries will still be performed as needed, hospital officials said. The decision comes amid a resurgence of confirmed cases across South Carolina, where state officials said there had been 56,485 total confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday afternoon. At least 950 people in South Carolina who contracted the virus have died.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state increased by 25 on Monday, and no new deaths were reported. South Dakota had a total of 7,524 COVID-19 cases as of Monday, according to the state health department. That doesn’t include people who show symptoms or are asymptomatic but are not tested. A total of 770 test results were reported Monday, and the positive rate for coronavirus tests was 3.2%. The death toll remained at 109. The state health department said 742 total people have been hospitalized during the pandemic, and 63 are currently hospitalized. The department has changed the time parameters for the data it provides every day. Data will now reflect information provided through 1 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. the previous day to allow staff to analyze the data during business hours instead of in the evenings, state epidemiologist Josh Clayton said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nearly 3,000 people have signed up to be poll workers during the coronavirus pandemic for the Aug. 6 primary, and many of the state’s counties still need more, officials said Monday. Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office said it’s not too late to apply, with signups available online. Early voting starts Friday and runs Mondays through Saturdays until Aug. 1. Hargett’s office began a poll worker recruitment campaign last month. Poll workers must be at least 16 or a registered voter if 18 or older. They cannot be a candidate or close relative of one and must be able to read and write in English. Poll workers must wear face coverings and will be trained on COVID-19 precautions, including social distancing. They will be provided personal protective equipment, including masks. Poll workers are paid for training, early voting and Election Day work. Additionally, they help count absentee votes.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Texas Supreme Court on Monday upheld Houston’s refusal to allow the state Republican convention to hold in-person events in the city due to the coronavirus pandemic. The court dismissed an appeal of a state district judge’s denial of a temporary restraining order sought by the state Republican Party. Shortly after the ruling, GOP leaders said they would call a meeting of the party’s executive committee to “finalize our path forward.” A separate court hearing was ongoing Monday in Harris County, where Houston is located, in which a different judge was hearing the party’s arguments to allow the convention to go forward. The state GOP convention had been scheduled to begin Thursday at Houston’s downtown convention center and was expected to draw thousands of participants. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, said last week that he had directed city lawyers to terminate the contract because he believed the event could not be held safely.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Prisons and jails have seen some of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19 in the U.S., and Washington County’s Purgatory Correctional Facility saw one of the nation’s fastest outbreaks in recent weeks when nearly a third of all inmates tested positive. At the peak of the outbreak, there were 96 inmate cases. Officials at the jail say they had a thorough plan in place, attributing the rapid spread to many inmates being asymptomatic and tough to diagnose before they spread it to others. Friends and family of the inmates haven’t been convinced. A large crowd gathered to share them during a vigil at the facility July 3 at which inmates’ family members spoke about how they feel the jail has not done enough to protect those on the inside from the virus. Then, on Friday, another group gathered in front of the Washington County Attorney’s office in protest of conditions at the jail.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state is suing the Department of Homeland Security to block a rule that would require foreign students to leave the country if their school only provides classes online this fall, the Attorney General’s Office said Monday. Vermont is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia that filed suit Monday, arguing the rule is cruel and unlawful. Last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified colleges that international students would have to leave the U.S. or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall. Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said the rule would be a huge loss to Vermont and its students. As of Friday, the University of Vermont had 566 active students from 67 countries who could be affected. UVM is currently planning to bring students back to campus for the fall semester with a combination of in-person and remote classes.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: With 90 cases of COVID-19 reported in the area since June 30, July is trending to be the worst month for new cases in Staunton, Waynesboro and Augusta County. Last month 131 new COVID cases were reported, not counting case numbers suppressed in ZIP codes where there were fewer than five total cases. July could hit 200 new cases before the month is out. Even if the trend slows down by half, July will still be the worst month so far for new cases. The good news: No new area deaths were reported during this time, according to data from the Virginia Department of Health. The bad news: multiple outbreaks in congregate settings in the Central Shenandoah Health District, which has now reported 11 outbreaks in non-nursing facility congregate settings. Also, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association’s statewide numbers show a sharp increase in hospitalizations in July after a slow but steady decrease for more than a month.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: An economic research study indicated border restrictions resulting from the coronavirus could reduce future cross-border shopping trips into the state by Canadians. The Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University released a report concerning money spent by Canadians in Whatcom County in northwest Washington, The Bellingham Herald reports. The border between Washington state and British Columbia has been restricted to essential travelers and commercial trade since March 21 because of the pandemic. The restrictions are scheduled to expire July 21, but experts believe some controls will be extended through the summer. Easing border restrictions may not prevent a long-term impact on Canadian shopping behavior in Whatcom County, the research report said. “Even after the restrictions are lifted, concerns about public health and safety could continue to inhibit Canadians from shopping in the U.S.,” the report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: The year 2020 started with a push for vocational education and hands-on learning, but this has been made difficult by COVID-19 threats and students forced into online education at home, The Intelligencer reports. More than 60% of students at Wheeling Park High School are involved in career-based training classes at the school, according to Stephanie Bugaj, director of career and technical education at WPHS. She said the district is looking to step up at-home opportunities for vocational students as their return to classrooms and school workshops may be further delayed this fall. “Teachers are communicating with students and trying to keep them engaged,” Bugaj said. “They can do a lot of skills at home. We’re trying to come up with things for them to do this fall.” There are online instructional classes for students in most vocational areas, and they can replicate what they see by working on projects at home, she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Dane County’s new mask mandate went into effect at 8 a.m. Monday, requiring all over the age of 5 to wear a face covering indoors in public settings. However, Madison and Dane County’s public health department asked residents not to call the police if someone is violating the new requirement, as health conditions or disabilities can make the task difficult. In a tweet, they asked the county not to judge others – and not to call 911. “You have a role too,” the department said in a Sunday blog post. “Your job is to wear your mask and stay six feet away from others. It’s not to ask someone why they aren’t wearing a mask or to intervene if they aren’t. Some people have disabilities or health conditions where wearing a mask is difficult or dangerous, and sometimes their disabilities and health conditions may not always be visible.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State corrections officials plan to test all inmates and employees for the coronavirus. Wyoming and Hawaii are the only states that haven’t reported cases of COVID-19 among their inmate populations. Corrections Department Director Bob Lampert said last week that he wants to confirm that’s indeed the case in Wyoming. The testing was to begin Monday at the Wyoming Honor Farm in Riverton, followed by the Women’s Center in Lusk, the Honor Camp in Newcastle, and the state maximum- and medium-security prisons in Rawlins and Torrington. Regular surveillance testing will continue after every inmate is tested by the end of August. Corrections officials say the tests aren’t optional, and inmates who refuse to be tested will need to quarantine for two weeks.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/14"}]}

Here's a look at what the Times found through their reporting.\n\n2002\n\nAccording to current and former employees interviewed by the Times, O’Reilly stormed into the Fox newsroom and screamed at a young producer. Not long after, the Times reported, the woman, Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, left the network with a payout. The case did not involve sexual harassment, the paper said. As part of the deal, Bernstein was subject to a confidentiality agreement.\n\n2004\n\nIn October 2004, O'Reilly, who had been at Fox News since 1996, was sued publicly for sexual harassment by 33-year-old Andrea Mackris, a former producer for The O'Reilly Factor. According to the Times, Mackris recorded some explicit conversations with O'Reilly, people familiar with the events told the paper. The case, which included a $60 million countersuit that alleged “scandalous and scurrilous” extortion, was fought out in the media for about two weeks before O’Reilly agreed to pay Mackris about $9 million, according to people briefed on the agreement who were interviewed by the Times.\n\n2011\n\nIn 2011, according to the Times, Rebecca Gomez Diamond, who had hosted a show on the Fox Business Network, was told the network was not renewing her contract. Like Mackris, the paper reported, she had recorded lewd conversations with O’Reilly, which her lawyers took to the company. Diamond left the network with a unknown payout and bound by a confidentiality agreement, according to the Times.\n\n2016\n\nIn 2016, according reporting by the Times, lawyers for Laurie Dhue, a Fox News anchor from 2000 to 2008, went to the company to outline harassment claims against O’Reilly as well as against Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who also was accused of harassment by several other women and who left the network in the same year. The case was settled for more than $1 million, a person briefed on the agreement told the Times.\n\nThe same year, according to the newspaper, Fox reached a $1.6 million settlement with Juliet Huddy, a regular guest on The O’Reilly Factor. Huddy’s lawyers alleged that O’Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011, the Times said, at a time he had significant influence over her airtime. Among Huddy’s complaints, the paper reported, was that he made inappropriate phone calls and that when he tried to kiss her, she pulled away and fell to the ground and he didn’t help her up.\n\nAlso in 2016, former Fox host Andrea Tantaros filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News, claiming that O'Reilly made sexually suggestive comments to her.\n\n\"Fox News masquerades as defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency, and misogyny,\" said her lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court in New York County.\n\n2017\n\nIn its investigation, the Times also reported a claim by former O'Reilly Factor guest Wendy Walsh, who, she alleged, declined an offer from O'Reilly to go to his hotel suite in 2013.\n\nWalsh said she came forward because she was told by a Times reporter that many of the women who have accused O'Reilly of harassment are bound by gag orders, according to an Associated Press report. She said she is not bound by any such agreement, and the statute of limitations for suing has run out.\n\nIn the wake of the Times' story, the O'Reilly Factor lost advertising from almost 60.\n\nOn April 11, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and was due to return to the show on April 24.\n\nDuring his absence, lawyer Lisa Bloom, who has aired harassment complaints by at least one other woman against O’Reilly, announced that a former Fox clerical worker, who is not contemplating any legal action, said he referred to her as “hot chocolate” at one point when they were together alone, made grunting noises and leered at her cleavage and legs. The woman, who is said to be African-American, believed she would be fired if she complained to anyone, according to Bloom, but did report her allegations to an anonymous company hotline set up in 2008.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/04/25/jimmy-kimmel-late-night-tucker-carlson-leaving-don-lemon-fired/11733585002/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel on Tucker Carlson leaving Fox News: 'What an ...", "text": "Don Lemon's split from CNN and Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News sent shockwaves throughout late night TV Monday with Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, James Corden and more taking jabs at the news hosts' unexpected outings.\n\nEarlier that day, Fox News announced the news network and Carlson \"have agreed to part ways.\" Shortly after, Lemon said he was fired from his post at CNN's \"CNN This Morning,\" which he co-anchored with Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow for about six months.\n\nJimmy Kimmel poked fun at both Tucker and Lemon on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Monday. \"This is like if Ronald McDonald and the Burger King got fired on the same day,\" he quipped.\n\nHere's what late-night comedians had to say about the cable news shakeup.\n\nKimmel jokes about Tucker Carlson's next move\n\n\"Fox News has severed bowties with Tucker Carlson after all these years they are parting ways, which means he was fired,\" Kimmel said as he played a clip from Fox News announcing Carlson's departure. \"What a shock, what an absolutely delightful shock this is.\"\n\nIn the midst of his segment, Kimmel was interrupted by a mock \"News Alert\" delivered by his co-host Guillermo Rodriguez teasing that ABC fired the late night comedian. \"On a personal note I'd like to say, Jimmy, don't let the door hit you on your way out … loser,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nDon Lemon fired by CNN, network disputes details\n\nTucker Carlson leaves Fox News in wake of Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit\n\nKimmel turned his attention back to Carlson, saying the host is \"probably not done poisoning old people’s brains.\"\n\n\"The question now is where will he do it next?\" he quipped. \"Will he go to OAN (One America News), will he go to Newsmax?

Several crises, from the coronavirus pandemic to a polarized public – have serious consequences for journalism and global press freedom.\n\nProsperous nations, which include some of the largest and oldest elected democracies in the world, tend to have greater press freedom than poorer countries. But this trend is far from consistent. The 50 richest countries in the world based on GDP per capita rank anywhere from best in the world, to among the worst 10 countries for freedom of the press.\n\nTo compare press freedom in the world’s richest countries, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2020 World Press Freedom Index scores in the 50 countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In its annual press freedom index, the non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) measures freedom of information throughout the world by combining survey-responses of media experts, as well as counts of acts of violence against journalists.\n\nElected leaders in many democracies, which are known for having free and independent media, have tried to silence critical outlets and promote those that offer favorable coverage. Even the president of the United States, one of the oldest democracies and a country famous for its fierce defense of its First Amendment that guarantees freedom of the press, has frequently demonized the news media as the “enemy of the people.” His rhetoric has given succor to political leaders in other countries who have passed bills making “fake news” illegal, and have framed articles they don’t like as bogus news.\n\nWhen it comes to press freedom, one region stands out. Scandinavian countries continue to lead the world, and western Europe media remains mostly free despite a few wobbles. These two regions lead the way in another important area – these are countries that have come closest to true gender equality.\n\nAsk HR:Can my employer require drug tests?\n\nHomeschooling budget:Homeschool pods are gaining traction amid worries about school reopening\n\n50.

The government has broad powers to shut down news outlets and websites and revoke licenses. Journalists are frequently harassed in the sultanate of 4 million people, and they can be arrested and detained incommunicado for charges such as insulting government authorities or trying to disrupt civil order. In 2016, two independent newspapers were shuttered or had operations suspended by the government.\n\n49.

Since anti-government protests in 2011 and 2012, free press has been stifled by website blocking and selectively applied laws that have landed journalists in prison. Meanwhile, television in the country pushes propaganda and is hostile towards members of the press trying to do their job fairly. Major TV networks in Russia are either state-run or managed by companies with close government ties.\n\n48. Malaysia\n\n• Population: 31,949,777\n\n• GDP per capita: $29,526\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 33.1 – 101st out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 36.7 – 123rd out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nPress freedom began to improve in Malaysia in 2018 after the ruling coalition Barisan Nasional was defeated after governing the Asian nation since 1957. The new government began easing laws and regulations that restricted the press, and the media are now offering more diverse coverage. The government is taking steps to end the Anti-Fake News Act, which the former government had adopted in April 2018. Even so, legislation such as the Sedition Act, the Official Secrets Act, and the Communications and Multimedia Act that have been used to suppress the press and regulate publication licenses, remains on the books.\n\n47. Croatia\n\n• Population: 4,067,500\n\n• GDP per capita: $29,973\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.5 – 59th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.0 – 64th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nAlthough Croatia's score and ranking in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index has improved slightly since last year, the country's situation for journalists remains \"problematic,\" according to RSF. The media enjoy a relatively high degree of independence, but investigative journalists, especially those looking into corruption, organized crime, or war crimes, are often targeted. It's illegal to publish \"humiliating\" content, as well as to insult the republic, flag, or national anthem.\n\nCroatian radio-TV, HRT, owned by the state, is financed by advertising and a license fee. However, officials often meddle in how it's run. Journalists who voice their objections are often sued.\n\n46. Seychelles\n\n• Population: 97,625\n\n• GDP per capita: $30,260\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.7 – 63rd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.4 – 69th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nMedia independence on the island nation in the Indian Ocean has been hampered by the country's legacy of decades-long communist party rule. The government exercises considerable influence over communications in the Seychelles – the government owns the island's only television station as well as two radio stations. However, a greater diversity of media choices are emerging, though independently owned media tends to be politically slanted. The press exercises self-censorship in regard to controversial national issues in deference to its tourism industry, which is important to the national economy.\n\n45. Greece\n\n• Population: 10,716,322\n\n• GDP per capita: $31,399\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.8 – 65th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.1 – 65th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom of the press has improved slightly in Greece since last year, although the country still has one of the worst environments for censorship of the media among wealthy nations. Recently, journalists have been attacked and detained by police, and the headquarters of a weekly newspaper was raided by an anarchist group. Additionally, one broadcasting firm and the state news agency were both placed under the supervision of the country's prime minister. Greater media independence and transparency would go a long way to improve press freedom in Greece.\n\n44. Latvia\n\n• Population: 1,912,789\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,204\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 18.6 – 22nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 19.5 – 24th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nMedia outlets in Latvia are allowed to operate freely, face relatively few legal restrictions, and represent a wide range of political views. While Latvia ranks better than most wealthy countries for press freedom, the country is not without some troubling issues. Politicians regularly verbally attack media outlets and the country's public media is woefully underfunded. Latvia's media landscape is also growing less diverse as the country's oldest TV channel was shut down in 2019 and its newsroom merged with another existing channel.\n\n43. Romania\n\n• Population: 19,356,544\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,297\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 25.9 – 48th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.7 – 47th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nOut of the 180 nations reviewed by Reporters Without Borders, Romania ranks 48th for press freedom. Unlike many wealthy countries that rank higher, Romania's political and ruling class encourages censorship by pressuring journalists to reveal sources and minimize criticism of leadership. Corruption in the media undercuts journalistic integrity and news outlets often act as a medium for political propaganda.\n\nAlthough Romania's press is considered to be more free than the press in most of the rest of the world, it lags behind most of the 50 wealthy countries on this list.\n\n42. Panama\n\n• Population: 4,246,439\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,762\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 29.8 – 76th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.8 – 79th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nOf all wealthy countries in both North and South America, Panama ranks as having the worst free press. Though most media outlets in the country are privately owned, the government still controls access to information and pressures media companies through allocation of state advertising revenue. Journalists in the country are often fined through defamation cases when they are critical of government policy or cover corruption.\n\nDespite these and other problems, press freedom is far better in Panama than it is in many of its poorer regional neighbors.\n\n41. Hungary\n\n• Population: 9,769,949\n\n• GDP per capita: $33,979\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.8 – 89th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 30.4 – 87th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nHungary's ruling party has tight control over the country's media landscape – which is dominated by a pro-government foundation. Independent journalists in the country are banned from certain events and from asking questions to members of parliament. Generally, politicians who hold power do not give interviews to outlets that are critical of the government. Investigative reporting on government corruption is generally published through online outlets.\n\nGreater media independence and transparency would greatly improve press freedom in Hungary.\n\n40. Slovakia\n\n• Population: 5,454,073\n\n• GDP per capita: $34,178\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.7 – 33rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 23.6 – 35th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nAs is the case in many of the world's wealthiest countries, press freedom in Slovakia is hampered by government influence and a lack of transparency. In 2018, an investigative journalist was murdered in Slovakia. The killing is believed to have been orchestrated by a businessman who had been surveilling other journalists and had close ties to judges and political figures.\n\nMany major outlets in the country are owned by one of two financial groups – Penta or J&T – and all newspapers are privately owned.\n\n39. Poland\n\n• Population: 37,970,874\n\n• GDP per capita: $34,218\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.7 – 62nd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 28.9 – 59th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nPoland's constitution protects freedom of expression and forbids censorship. Still, journalists can face up to a year in jail for defamation and this has a chilling effect on independent media outlets in the country.\n\nTVP, one of the three TV networks that dominate the landscape in Poland, is state owned and in 2015, the controlling party introduced a bill that would allow ministers to appoint the network head. The network has effectively become a propaganda machine and non-compliant employees are terminated. In most of the 50 wealthiest countries in the world, the press has more freedom than in Poland.\n\n38. Portugal\n\n• Population: 10,269,417\n\n• GDP per capita: $36,471\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 11.8 – 10th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.6 – 12th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nPress freedom – protected under the national constitution – is exemplary in Portugal. Though defamation is illegal in the country, prosecutions are not common. The most outspoken critics of the press in Portugal, unlike much of the rest of the world, are not politicians or the government, but rather soccer clubs that put media outlets in their crosshairs for reporting on potentially unflattering practices.\n\n37. Lithuania\n\n• Population: 2,786,844\n\n• GDP per capita: $38,214\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 21.2 – 28th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.1 – 30th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom House gives Lithuania a \"free\" assessment in regard to press freedom. The organization says the Baltic country, which was occupied by the Soviet Union until that nation's dissolution in 1991, generally respects freedoms of speech and the press, though some media power brokers try to exercise political influence.\n\nThe media is on guard for attempts by the government to curtail media freedom. In 2019, new legislation permitted the government to suspend radio or television operations if they are considered a threat to the nation's security.\n\n36. Estonia\n\n• Population: 1,326,590\n\n• GDP per capita: $38,811\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 14th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.3 – 11th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nEstonia has one of the best environments for a free press of any country in the world. Unlike some other former Soviet republics, it has not banned rebroadcasting of Russian TV networks – although at the end of 2019, Estonia did force a pro-Russia outlet to close its office in the country, citing EU sanctions on the company's director-general.\n\nThe county's press freedom rating fell slightly from the previous year as right-wing politicians have verbally attacked journalists. Additionally, last year investigative and opinion journalists at the country's oldest newspaper resigned en masse over revelations that the paper's owner was using his position to promote a conservative agenda.\n\n35. Slovenia\n\n• Population: 2,087,946\n\n• GDP per capita: $40,657\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.6 – 32nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.3 – 34th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom of speech and freedom of the press are constitutionally protected in Slovenia, a nation created out of the former Yugoslavia. However, RSF is concerned about the concentration of media sources and intimidation campaigns against journalists. Defamation is considered a crime in Slovenia and under the Mass Media Act, people who claim to be offended by a story can demand a correction. Journalists can also be legally forced to reveal their sources. State-owned entities hold stakes in media properties, making them susceptible to government interference.\n\n34. Cyprus\n\n• Population: 1,198,575\n\n• GDP per capita: $41,254\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 20.4 – 27th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 21.7 – 28th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Cypriot media are a reflection of the island's political division – the Turkish-controlled zone in the north has its own media outlets. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the constitution and is generally observed. Politicians, as well as the Orthodox Church, have a lot of influence over the media.\n\nIn March 2020, a pipe bomb exploded in front of the building where outlets owned by the Cypriot news agency MC Digital Media operate. Cyprustimes.com called the explosion an attempt to \"intimidate\" the media.\n\n33. Israel\n\n• Population: 9,053,300\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,194\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.8 – 88th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 30.8 – 88th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nWhile it is a pillar of journalistic freedom in the Middle East, Israel lags behind the vast majority of wealthy countries when it comes to freedom of the press. Media outlets are often banned from covering certain subjects and journalists have been personally targeted by smear campaigns at the behest of politicians and political parties.\n\nFew journalists cover the plight of Palestinians. Two Palestinian journalists were killed by Israeli Defense Force snipers in 2018.\n\n32. Spain\n\n• Population: 47,076,781\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,214\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.2 – 29th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.0 – 29th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nAlthough it lags behind Portugal, its neighbor to the west, Spain has a better freedom-of-the-press rating than most wealthy countries. Still, the media in Spain is increasingly becoming a target of criticism, as a rising political party is crusading against the press by harassing them and barring them from events. In politically divided Catalonia, journalists have been violently assaulted by both separatists and police alike. Investigative journalists are also increasingly targeted, having the protection of their sources overridden by judicial authorities.\n\n31. Czech Republic\n\n• Population: 10,669,709\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,576\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.6 – 40th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 24.9 – 40th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nWhile press freedom is better in the Czech Republic than in most of the rest of the world, the country still faces considerable challenges. Public distrust toward the media is being sown by verbal attacks from elected officials at the highest level. Additionally, the nation's prime minister has considerable media holdings and critics allege that newspapers are becoming a tool for furthering the PM's political interests.\n\nThere are also new concerns in the country that too many media outlets are being concentrated in the hands of a wealthy few, following the 2019 acquisition of a media conglomerate that owns some of the most influential outlets in the country by a Czech billionaire.\n\n30. South Korea\n\n• Population: 51,709,098\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,029\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.7 – 42nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 24.9 – 41st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Republic of Korea fell more than 30 places in RSF's World Press Freedom Index over a decade. During that time, journalists at two public broadcasters objected to the government selecting their bosses for them. This ended when the Moon administration came to power in 2016, succeeding the government of President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached for corruption. Journalists have been free to report on corruption in South Korea, however, they can be imprisoned for defamation, and the government is especially sensitive about stories involving North Korea.\n\n29. Japan\n\n• Population: 126,264,931\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,236\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.9 – 66th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.4 – 67th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nPress freedom in Japan ranks behind the majority of the other richest countries in the world. A law that can put journalists and whistleblowers in prison for a decade for obtaining information in a manner deemed to be illegal has had a chilling effect and contributes to businesses undue influence over the press. Members of the press also frequently complain of a climate of mistrust and a system that discriminates against freelancers and foreign journalists since 2012, when Shinzo Abe was elected prime minister again.\n\nStill, certain newspapers remain trusted and widely circulated in the country.\n\n28. New Zealand\n\n• Population: 4,917,000\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,953\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.7 – 9th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 10.8 – 7th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\nNew Zealand has been ranked ninth in the latest World Press Freedom Index, falling two places since last year. The report says the country's media is free, but \"its independence and pluralism are often undermined by the profit imperatives of media groups trying to cut costs.\"\n\nConcerns about the Official Information Act have been raised as it prevents journalists from doing their job properly by allowing government agencies to take a long time before responding to information requests and also permitting them to charge for such information.\n\n27. Italy\n\n• Population: 60,297,396\n\n• GDP per capita: $44,197\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.7 – 41st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.0 – 43rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nAlthough Italy has moved up two spots in the World Press Freedom Index, and the environment in which journalists are working is still \"satisfactory,\" according to the RSF, intimidation against reporters is common. As of 2020, about 20 Italian journalists are under 24/7 police protection because of mafia threats or attempts on their lives.\n\nItaly, ranked 41st out of 180 countries, has among the worst rankings in Europe, with only about 10 countries on the continent faring worse. Though politicians are nicer to journalists than in previous years, reporters are still verbally and physically targeted by the far right Five Star Movement, which is part of the government coalition.\n\n26. Malta\n\n• Population: 502,653\n\n• GDP per capita: $45,652\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.2 – 81st out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.7 – 77th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nThough Freedom House gives Malta a \"free\" assessment, the assassination in 2017 of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was investigating government links to dodgy investment deals, rocked the the Mediterranean island nation and it slipped four spots on the RSF World Press Freedom Index to 81st. Massive protests over how the inquiry into Galizia's death was handled and revelations of extensive government corruption led to the resignation of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Despite a change in government, the media claims state interference such as unlawful detention of journalists has continued.\n\n25. Bahrain\n\n• Population: 1,641,172\n\n• GDP per capita: $46,892\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 60.1 – 169th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 61.3 – 167th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nMedia outlets and journalists in Bahrain are under strict official control. The major TV and radio networks are owned by the state and avoid criticism of the ruling class. A critical newspaper was shut down in 2017. Freedom House said in 2018 that legislation is used to detain or jail critical journalists and online activists.\n\nRSF called Bahrain \"notorious for jailing many journalists, especially photographers and cameramen.\" Dissent or criticism of the government or its policies is basically illegal. Foreign journalists face many obstacles before being granted a press visa to the kingdom.\n\n24. United Kingdom\n\n• Population: 66,834,405\n\n• GDP per capita: $48,710\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.9 – 35th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.2 – 33rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nJournalists in the United Kingdom are free to report on all aspects of life and virtually all political opinions are reflected in the media. The country, home to the world-renowned BBC, recently co-hosted a Global Conference for Media Freedom and has taken on the role of co-chair of the new Media Freedom Coalition. However, it is not without some problems relating to press freedom.\n\nRecently, the country's Conservative Party threatened a review of BBC's license fee that all households with a TV pay, and a review of the publicly owned, public service network Channel 4.\n\n23. Saudi Arabia\n\n• Population: 34,268,528\n\n• GDP per capita: $48,908\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 62.1 – 170th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 65.9 – 172nd out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nThere is no press freedom in Saudi Arabia as there are no independent media outlets and journalists are under close surveillance, according to RSF. Criticism of the government or royal family is not allowed and self-censorship is prevalent. Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist often critical of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. A 2019 UN report found \"credible evidence\" that the crown prince and other senior officials were responsible for the killing.\n\nThe government admits to widespread internet censorship, targeting several kinds of articles including those from political sites.\n\n22. France\n\n• Population: 67,059,887\n\n• GDP per capita: $49,435\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.9 – 34th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.2 – 32nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe French press operates with little restraint and there is a diversity of media in France, although there is some concern at RSF about the concentration of media in the hands of a few companies. Violence against journalists increased in 2019 as many in the media were tear-gassed or injured while covering protests by the anti-tax demonstrators from the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vest) movement. RSF also noted a surge in judicial interference intended to force reporters covering sensitive stories to reveal sources. Twelve people at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were killed in 2015 by Islamic extremists after the publication published cartoons they considered blasphemous.\n\n21. Finland\n\n• Population: 5,520,314\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,324\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 7.9 – 2nd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 7.9 – 2nd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nBefore Finland dropped to third place in 2017's World Press Freedom Index, the country was No. 1 for seven years in a row. Since then, Finland has moved up again, maintaining second place since 2019. Several measures were taken in 2019 by the government to limit the targeting of journalists with the purpose of silencing them. However, existing regulations are vague and weak, according to RSF. Police and courts have refused to take on big cases and therefore review of applicable laws and strong precedent cases is urgently required.\n\nThe organization also notes that journalists in Finland are not immune to pressure, giving as an example some politicians who have encouraged behavior aimed at suppressing voices in social media.\n\n20. Canada\n\n• Population: 37,589,262\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,342\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.3 – 16th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.7 – 18th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nCanada has been vigorous in defending press freedom. This was underscored by a law passed in 2017 that says journalists cannot be required to reveal confidential sources unless a judge is convinced the information can't be obtained any other way or it is in the public interest that the source be revealed.\n\nIn 2019, Canada and the United Kingdom created the Media Freedom Coalition in July 2019, an international alliance that champions and protects press freedom.\n\n19. Kuwait\n\n• Population: 4,207,083\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,912\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 34.3 – 109th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 33.9 – 108th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nSimilar to other Persian Gulf countries, Kuwait ranks relatively low in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, but it's the least repressive among them, according to RSF. State broadcasters work in cooperation with privately owned outlets and criticism of the emir and the government is not tolerated. The cyber-crime law applies to bloggers and online journalists, and they have to apply to the government for licenses.\n\nThere are many arrests and convictions of bloggers and online activists. They face charges of destabilizing the country if they make any derogatory comments about the emir, the royal family, its allies, or religion.\n\n18. Australia\n\n• Population: 25,364,307\n\n• GDP per capita: $53,320\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 20.2 – 26th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 16.6 – 21st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThough press freedom is not mentioned directly in its constitution, the media have historically had free rein to operate in Australia, which is regarded as \"free\" by Freedom House. Even so, journalists were reminded of the fragility of press freedom in 2019 when the home of a reporter and the headquarters of state-run Australian Broadcasting Corporation were raided by police based on claims of national security following reporting of alleged misconduct of Australian troops in Afghanistan. Australia also has among the strictest defamation laws in a liberal democracy.\n\n17. Belgium\n\n• Population: 11,484,055\n\n• GDP per capita: $54,545\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 12th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.1 – 9th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nBelgium's constitution is very precise about guaranteeing press freedom. It states that \"the press is free; censorship may never be established and no security may be demanded from writers, publishers or printers [and] where the author is known and resides in Belgium, the publisher, printer or distributor may not be prosecuted.\"\n\nThough historically the media has been free in Belgium, the situation for journalists is worsening, according to RSF. In an unprecedented move, reporters with a Flemish-language TV station protested the lack of resources and budget cuts imposed by the Flemish government. Another protest addressed the sudden dismissal of journalists from L'Avenir, who were investigating a financial scandal involving the company that owns the newspaper.\n\n16. Sweden\n\n• Population: 10,285,453\n\n• GDP per capita: $55,815\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 9.3 – 4th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 8.3 – 3rd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\nIn Sweden, ranked fourth in press freedom by the RSF, the media are mostly privately owned, though the RSF points out that five media companies own more than 50% of local media outlets. Swedish public media are funded by taxes rather than licensing.\n\nAbout one-third of Swedish journalists say they have been targets of online threats. Exiled Iranian journalists in Sweden have received threats from the Iranian government. Law enforcement takes an active role in combating attacks against the press.\n\nFast food improvements:Burger King parent company shows signs of recovery thanks to drive-thrus\n\nDriving an old car?:Vehicles on the road keep getting older, and COVID-19 could push the age higher\n\n15. Germany\n\n• Population: 83,132,799\n\n• GDP per capita: $56,052\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.2 – 11th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 14.6 – 13th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nGermany, which has the biggest population and the largest and most competitive television market in the European Union, improved its press freedom score and ranking since 2019. Germany, which has a history of controlling the media under the Nazi regime and later in East Germany under communist rule, is serious about preserving the freedom of the press – the constitution guarantees it. In May 2020, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled mass surveillance unconstitutional. This makes spying on foreign journalists illegal and protects informants who want to remain confidential.\n\nHowever, the RSF warns of a slow but steady erosion of media pluralism for economic reasons, as well as weak laws on information access.\n\n14. Austria\n\n• Population: 8,877,067\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,111\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.8 – 18th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.3 – 16th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe constitution and the Media Law of 1981 underpin press freedom in Austria. However, libel and slander laws remain in place and shield politicians and government officials. Given its history of anti-Semitism, Austrian law forbids any form of neo-Nazism or anti-Semitism, as well as denial of the Holocaust. Media ownership in Austria is still highly concentrated.\n\nA scandal involving the chairman of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria brought down the right/far right ruling coalition led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, prompting the formation of a new government that included the more left-leaning Green Party. That has not stopped the government from denying the media certain information held by the government.\n\n13. Netherlands\n\n• Population: 17,332,850\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,687\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.0 – 5th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 8.6 – 4th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Netherlands, which ranks fifth in the World Press Freedom Index, belongs to the 8% of the countries that are classified as having a \"good\" situation. The government supports a free press, according to RSF. However, the organization warns of worrisome emerging trends. Far right populist politicians have been questioning the legitimacy of established media and aggression against journalists is a serious concern, as online attacks, including death threats, are frequent.\n\nFreedom of the press and free speech are guaranteed by the constitution and media organizations are allocated airtime on TV and radio based on the number of members they have. Competition between commercial and public stations is fierce. In addition, people have access to a lot of domestic and foreign channels.\n\n12. Denmark\n\n• Population: 5,818,553\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,830\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 8.1 – 3rd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 9.9 – 5th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Scandinavian nation of Denmark ranks third in the RSF listing in press freedom. Denmark has a long history of freedom of expression that was included in a provision in the nation's constitution of 1849. Danish media express a variety of opinions and are frequently critics of the government. The Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten published cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed that were later reprinted by the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo in France.\n\nDenmark was shaken in 2017 when Swedish journalist Kim Wall was killed in Copenhagen by a Danish man who was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2018.\n\n11. Iceland\n\n• Population: 361,313\n\n• GDP per capita: $60,061\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.1 – 15th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 14.7 – 14th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe sparsely populated North Atlantic island, famous as much for its hot springs as for its first ranking in gender equality, has dropped slightly in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index. Iceland's current score of 15.1 is noticeably worse than the country's Nordic neighbors, all of which have a score of under 10.\n\nThe constitution of Iceland guarantees absolute freedom of speech and there are laws protecting whistleblowers, sources, and media independence, but relations between outlets and politicians have worsened and ownership is highly concentrated.\n\n10. Hong Kong SAR, China\n\n• Population: 7,507,400\n\n• GDP per capita: $62,375\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.0 – 80th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.7 – 73rd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nPress freedom is under siege in Hong Kong, whose standing in the RSF rankings fell seven places to 80. The territory was designated a special administrative region following the handover to the People's Republic of China from Great Britain in 1997. The agreement provided for freedom of expression but there has been repression by Beijing. The result has been self-censorship among journalists reluctant to criticize the communist regime.\n\nIn 2018, Victor Mallet was forced out as editor of the Financial Times Asia because he chaired an event for the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong that rankled the Chinese government. The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong controls in part or in whole two daily newspapers in the SAR.\n\n9. Brunei Darussalam\n\n• Population: 433,285\n\n• GDP per capita: $64,673\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 49.7 – 152th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 51.5 – 152th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nBrunei, an absolute monarchy in which the sultan exercises executive power, shows no improvement for journalists' freedom. In 2020, Brunei's ranking remained at 152 out of 180 countries, though the country's score has improved slightly. Self-censorship persists for the state-owned Radio Television Brunei and for the major daily newspapers, which the sultan's family owns.\n\nRepressive legislation, rendered even harsher by the introduction and enforcement of a strict version of Islamic Sharia law, discourages any content deemed critical of the royal family. Bloggers posting independently reported information can be charged with criminal defamation.\n\n8. United States\n\n• Population: 328,239,523\n\n• GDP per capita: $65,281\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.9 – 45th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.7 – 48th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nSince Donald Trump became president in 2017, the chief executive and the media have had a confrontational relationship. The president has limited access to some journalists and denigrated others. He's chided the media for what he calls \"fake news.\" Anti-press sentiment has found its way into public polls and a growing segment of the public does not trust the media. Although the United States has among the strongest press protections in the world, the media have become more polarized since Trump became president. This has contributed to the United States' 45th ranking on the RSF World Press Freedom Index list.\n\nRecent U.S. government hostility to the media predates Trump. In 2013, New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger said the Obama administration was \"the most closed, control freak administration\" he had ever covered.\n\n7. Norway\n\n• Population: 5,347,896\n\n• GDP per capita: $66,832\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 7.8 – 1st out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 7.8 – 1st out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nNorway has topped RSF's Press Freedom Index since 2017. Historically, Europe's northernmost country has ranked high in terms of freedom from censorship and pressure from government officials. The country seems to want to do even better. The government mandated a review of the conditions for freedom of speech. Those involved have to consider measures to promote public debate, stop fake news and hate speech, keep journalists safe, and counter self-censorship.\n\nPublic broadcaster NRK operates alongside major privately owned TV and radio networks. As of 2020, NRK is funded by the state budget through a dedicated tax as opposed to license fees.\n\n6. United Arab Emirates\n\n• Population: 9,770,529\n\n• GDP per capita: $69,901\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 42.7 – 131st out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 43.6 – 133rd out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nFreedom House has determined that the United Arab Emirates is \"not free\" and it is ranked 131st on RSF's World Press Freedom Index. The nation on the Arabian Peninsula guarantees press freedom under its constitution, however, a law passed in 1980 lets authorities censor local or foreign publications if they criticize UAE's domestic policies, the economy, the ruling families, or religion. This is considered to be one of the most restrictive press laws in the world.\n\nThe UAE has pursued robust surveillance of journalists online and in 2017 imprisoned a blogger for posting \"false information, rumors and lies,\" which the nation said damaged the UAE's reputation.\n\n5. Switzerland\n\n• Population: 8,574,832\n\n• GDP per capita: $70,989\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 10.5 – 6th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.6 – 8th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nSwitzerland ranks eighth in RSF's 2020 Global Index of Press Freedom, two spots below its placement in 2019. Though the country continues to rank high and is considered safe for journalists, financial problems in the Swiss media industry may spell trouble, according to RSF.\n\nThe media makes most of its money from TV license fees. Some funding comes from advertising. The digital revolution has hit outlets, which continue to close and content has become less diverse.\n\nTroubles aside, Switzerland is among just 14 countries – or about 8% of the 180 nations RSF has reviewed – with a \"good\" situation in terms of freedom of the press.\n\n4. Ireland\n\n• Population: 4,941,444\n\n• GDP per capita: $88,241\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 13th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.0 – 15th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nIreland gained two spots on the RSF ranking and rose to 13th on the World Press Freedom Index. It adopted a referendum in 2018 that decriminalized blasphemy, a move that improved press freedom.\n\nThe press in Ireland is free and independent though RSF and Freedom House express concern about the concentration of media. Independent News and Media controls much of the newspaper sector, while partly state-run company RTE dominates the broadcast market. The frequent awarding of defamation damages by the courts represents a threat to press freedom in the country.\n\n3. Qatar\n\n• Population: 2,832,067\n\n• GDP per capita: $96,491\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 42.5 – 129th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 42.5 – 128th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nQatar is well-known for Al-Jazeera, an international TV broadcaster owned by the government. The channel has a good reputation in the Middle East and the rest of the world, but it avoids criticism of the state. In 2019, the Qatari government abruptly ordered the closure of the Doha Centre for Media Freedom, which protected journalists whose lives were in danger in their home countries.\n\nQatar's press freedom score in 2020 is 42.5, which places it in the second worst category, according to RSF – \"difficult situation.\" Qatar authorities filter online content deemed offensive or objectionable, which includes materials from human rights organizations.\n\n2. Singapore\n\n• Population: 5,703,569\n\n• GDP per capita: $101,376\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 55.2 – 158th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 51.4 – 151st out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nSingapore may have one of the more robust economies in Asia, but the former British colony is among the most repressive, falling seven spots in the latest World Press Freedom Index rankings to 158th. The nation only has a \"partly free\" assessment by Freedom House.\n\nThe Asian city-state owns all domestic newspapers, radio stations, and television channels through companies connected to the government. Singapore exercises press control using religious and racial tensions and the fear of terrorism to clamp down on the media. Many journalists self-censor and media outlets and bloggers have been penalized for stories and opinions considered to be seditious or defamatory. Defamation lawsuits are common in Singapore. Online news providers must obtain licenses and may have to remove certain content at the request of regulators.\n\n1. Luxembourg\n\n• Population: 619,896\n\n• GDP per capita: $121,293\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.7 – 17th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.5 — 17th out of 180 (“satisfactory”)\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nLuxembourg ranks 17th in the 2020 Global Index of Press Freedom, the same rank as in 2019. The country's journalists still don't have the right to free access and information. The Luxembourgish association of professional journalists (ALJP) has criticized the government for its limited and centralized information policy. In 2019, journalists at the state-owned radio accused government officials of influencing how the station was being run.\n\nRSF has described press freedom in Luxembourg, the richest country in the world by GDP per capita, as pluralist but dependent on business interests.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the degree of freedom available to journalists in the world’s richest countries, 24/7 Wall St. ranked 2020 World Press Freedom Index scores from Paris-based international non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in the 50 countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.\n\nRSF administered a survey to media professionals, lawyers, sociologists, and other experts around the world and combined these survey results with quantitative data on abuses and violence against journalists and media outlets. This data was collected in 2019 for 180 countries. The scores range between 0 (good situation) and 100 (very serious situation).\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita in current international dollars for the 194 countries with available data was obtained from the World Bank. All GDP figures are for 2019, the latest year for which data is available.\n\nMacao SAR, China, San Marino, Aruba, The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Sint Maarten (Dutch part) – the 1st, 6th, 13th, 39th, 42nd, 44th, 48th richest regions based on World Bank GDP per capita – were not among the 180 countries and territories reviewed by RSF.\n\nWe also considered gross national income (GNI) per capita where available, an income measurement that includes income from residents, businesses, and foreign sources. GNI was also obtained from the World Bank. The countries’ population figures also came from the World Bank and are as of 2019.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents would reveal decades later the extent of Julius Rosenberg’s involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel’s participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second-generation thermonuclear device.

Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and of its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown v. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system is unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. Her arrest for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader working to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians take to the streets, demanding democratic reforms.

Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School. This would become one of the first high-profile actions the federal government would take against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: US launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sends its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. The two superpowers would go on to send more satellites into space, creating a Cold War space race to build ever more sophisticated orbital communications devices and to achieve spaceflight capabilities and generally space superiority.\n\n1959: Castro takes over Cuba\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Havana\n\nU.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista flees Havana as Fidel Castro’s forces advance on the Cuban capital. Days later, rebels led by Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos enter the city, followed two days later by Castro’s forces. Castro quickly consolidates power in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the Caribbean’s largest country.\n\n1960: Lunch counter sit-in\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nWhen four African American college students – Ezell A. Blair, Franklin E. McCain, Joseph A. McNeil, and David L. Richmond – sit down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter and ask for service, they are denied. The young men refuse to give up their seats, their sit-in leading to a larger six-month protest that results in the desegregation of the lunch counter by that summer and many other restaurants across the south.\n\n1961: Berlin Wall built\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nBy the late summer of 1961, the loss of skilled workers such as teachers, engineers, and doctors to the West reaches crisis levels in East Germany. On Aug. 12, 2,400 East Germans cross into West Berlin, the most in a single day. The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany begins building a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years. The wall would serve as an enduring symbol of the Cold War, used by presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to inspire a divided city.\n\n1962: Cuban missile crisis\n\n• Date: Oct.16-28\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWhen the United States learns that the Soviet Union is building nuclear missile installations 90 miles south of Miami in communist Cuba, the Kennedy administration enacts a naval blockade around the island, which is at times tested, to demand the removal of the missiles. The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F. Kennedy prepares for his re-election bid, the 34th president of the United States embarks on a multi-state tour in September 1963.

Johnson struggles to shift focus away from the Vietnam War and on his stated goals of reducing poverty, ending segregation, and establishing the social programs that many Americans rely on to this day, including the immensely popular Medicare program. During his “War on Poverty” State of the Union Address of Jan. 8, 1964, LBJ outlines the need for the country to reduce poverty, end racial discrimination, attend to the health needs of the elderly, and other progressive goals. LBJ later ushers in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965.\n\n1965: Selma to Montgomery march\n\n• Date: March 7\n\n• Location: Selma, Alabama\n\nThe fatal shooting of protester Jimmy Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper sparks a march in the state from Selma to Montgomery.

A ceasefire goes into effect on June 10.\n\n1968: Dream denied\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Memphis, Tennessee\n\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is fatally shot by James Earl Ray as the civil rights icon stands on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, a tragedy that sparks race riots nationwide. King’s influence in words and actions touch and move not only the nation, but the world, and resonate to this day. Two months later, on June 4, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and brother of John F. Kennedy, is fatally shot by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab Christian from Jerusalem, who believes Kennedy is “instrumental” in oppressing Palestinians.\n\n1969: Landing on the moon\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Moon\n\nPresident Kennedy’s goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 is realized six years after his assassination. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins blast off from the Kennedy Space Center at 9:32 a.m. aboard the Saturn V rocket. After three days of travel, Armstrong and Aldrin land the Eagle module on the lunar surface as Collins remains in lunar orbit to pilot the module. Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation.

The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate. In the following elections, Lech Wałęsa, leader of the Solidarity Movement and the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, wins the election and becomes president.\n\n1991: American goes to war in Middle East\n\n• Date: Jan. 17\n\n• Location: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\n\nAfter Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invades and occupies Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, the United States sends forces to defend neighboring Saudi Arabia from being overrun and to protect its vital oil assets there, calling it Operation Desert Shield. With Saudi Arabia secured, the United States implements Operation Desert Storm to push Iraqi forces back across the border with Kuwait in a military operation that lasts until a ceasefire takes effect in April.\n\n1992: Cold War ends\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Camp David, Maryland\n\nJust weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec. 26, 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, meet at Camp David to formally declare the end of the Cold War that began shortly after the end of World War II. The meeting comes days after both countries announce they would stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other. Russia declares its 11 former communist satellite republics – from Armenia to Uzbekistan – independent.\n\n1993: The EU becomes reality\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Brussels\n\nThe Treaty of the European Union, also known as the Maastricht Treaty, goes into effect in November, after a rough series of political wrangling. Among other concessions, the treaty allows the U.K. and Denmark to opt out of the common euro currency. The treaty opens the way to removing border controls among member states and invites new members to join the union.\n\n1994: Rwandan genocide\n\n• Date: April-July\n\n• Location: Rwanda\n\nFor decades, Rwanda has been embroiled in a conflict between the country's two major ethnic groups – the Hutu and the Tutsi. Over 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people are killed, mostly Tutsis, but some moderate Hutus as well. When Tutsi militant group eventually gains control of the country, some two million Rwandans flee to nearby African nations. In 2008, three former Rwandan officials are convicted by an international court of organizing the genocide.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child-care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n'You can do better':Jeff Bezos ripped for $690K Australian wildfire relief donation\n\nCutting the cord:As prices go up, here's how you can still save money streaming\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland’s Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one. After 277 cell fusions that developed 29 embryos, the team manages to turn an udder cell into a virtually identical biological carbon copy of the sheep from which it came.\n\n1997: Machine tops chess champ\n\n• Date: May 11\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning notch a significant victory in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue machine defeats a world chess champion.

Security Council authorization as Russia and China oppose the attack. The NATO air strikes are aimed at stopping an onslaught against ethnic Albanians by the government of Slobodan Milošević. The NATO attacks last nearly three months, culminating in the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.\n\n2000: International Space Station opens\n\n• Date: Nov. 2\n\n• Location: Low earth orbit\n\nCommanders Bill Shepherd from the United States and Yuri Gidzenko of Russia, along with Russian flight engineer Sergei Krikalev, become the first temporary residents of the International Space Station two years after the first component of the research center was put into low-Earth orbit about 250 miles above sea level. Since that first crew, there have been 229 other visitors to the ISS, some of them multiple times, led by 146 from the United States and 47 from Russia.\n\n2001: 9/11\n\n• Date: Sept. 11\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nIn the worst attack on U.S. soil since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, 19 hijackers inspired by Islamist extremism kill nearly 3,000 people after crashing three passenger-laden commercial aircraft into the World Trade Center towers in lower Manhattan and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. A fourth plane, United Airlines 93, crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers and crew attempt to regain control of the plane headed to Washington D.C.\n\n2002: Homeland Security Act\n\n• Date: Nov. 25\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nFollowing the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush enact the Homeland Security Act, the biggest government reorganization of national security efforts since the Department of Defense was created in 1947. The sweeping legislation creates the massive Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for everything from protecting infrastructure from cyber attacks to managing the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n2003: US invades Iraq\n\n• Date: March 19\n\n• Location: Iraq\n\nWith the help of British and other allied forces, the United States begins its invasion of Iraq with a rapid bombing called Shock and Awe with the intention of destroying Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction; the weapons are never found.

A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

This included members of Congress. Today, though all congressional representatives earn salaries, not much else has changed.\n\nThe typical congressional representative – including both senators and House members – has an estimated net worth of over $500,000, or roughly five times the median U.S. household net worth. The high net worth of American lawmakers is partially attributable to their annual salaries of $174,000, which is more than triple the average wage across all American workers of $51,960 and higher than the median earnings of even the highest paying jobs in America.\n\nStill, the wealthiest congressional representatives did not earn their fortunes as public servants. Many of the wealthiest legislators first had successful and lucrative careers in the private sector. Others, meanwhile, have married into or inherited vast fortunes.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the estimated net worth of U.S. congressional representatives from Roll Call, a Capitol Hill news outlet, to identify the 76 richest members of Congress. Only lawmakers with an estimated net worth of more than $3 million are included on this list. Net worth figures are rounded estimates derived from financial disclosure forms filed in 2018 and are not necessarily comprehensive or exact.\n\n76. Sen.

Net worth figures are based on recent financial filings and are representative of the time that each House member or senator was beginning his or her term in the 115th Congress. Net worth figures are by no means comprehensive or exact, as members of Congress are not required to report their principal residences or their contents (the largest assets for most Americans), and they report their financial assets and liabilities in broad ranges of value. Data on the year each House member or senator started serving as a member of Congress, district served, and party affiliation came from Congress.gov. The year each House member or senator’s current term ends came from nonprofit political encyclopedia Ballotpedia. Only House members and senators currently serving in the 116th congress were considered.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

And as of Friday evening, Republican Adam Laxalt is holding onto a slim lead of just more than 800 votes over Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nWhile those races remain in play, CNN projected Friday that Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly will defeat Republican Blake Masters in Arizona, and Republican Joe Lombardo will knock off Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in Nevada.\n\nKelly’s Senate win puts Democrats one seat away from maintaining control of the Senate, with just the Nevada race uncalled. If Cortez Masto wins, Democrats have at least 50 seats needed regardless of the outcome of the Georgia Senate runoff. If Laxalt wins, the Georgia run-off will determine Senate control, as it did in 2021.\n\nControl of the House, meanwhile, remains up in the air, with 21 races still uncalled. Democrats have won 203 seats so far, while Republicans have won 211 (218 seats are needed to control the House), according to CNN projections. Many of the uncalled House races are in California.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate makeup of both chambers next year, Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance has prompted a backlash against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, while a handful of Senate Republicans are calling for a delay in next week’s scheduled leadership elections.\n\nHere’s what to know as Election Day turns to Election Weekend:\n\nAll eyes on Nevada with Senate in the balance\n\nIn Clark County, Nevada’s largest, which includes Las Vegas, county officials estimate there are roughly 22,000 more mail-in ballots to be counted, along with more than 5,000 provisional ballots and ballots that need to be cured.\n\nIn Washoe County, Nevada’s second-most populous and home to Reno, CNN estimates that roughly 12,000 ballots remain to be counted, along with more than 5,000 provisional ballots and ballots that need to be cured.\n\nClark County will also release results from its remaining 22,000 mail-in ballots on Saturday, according to registrar Joe Gloria.\n\nGloria said during a news conference on Saturday that the results will be released “sometime this afternoon or early evening,” and he estimated that this could happen around 7 p.m. ET at the earliest.\n\nState law allows for mail-in ballots to be received in Nevada through Saturday, though the ballots need to have been postmarked by Election Day to be valid. An additional 268 ballots arrived by mail on Saturday, according to Gloria, but only ballots that were postmarked by Election Day will count.\n\nPolitical organizations, especially Democratic-leaning unions, that spent months urging people to vote in Nevada’s key Senate race are now turning their focus toward “curing” flawed mail-in ballots in the still-uncalled contest.\n\n“Curing” is a process in which voters correct problems with their mail ballot, ensuring that it gets counted. This can mean validating that a ballot is truly from them by adding a missing signature, or by addressing signature-match issues. The deadline for voters to “cure” their ballots in Nevada is Monday, November 14, according to state law. There are 7,139 mail ballots that could still be “cured,” Gloria said Saturday.\n\nGloria also said Saturday that there were still 5,555 provisional ballots that need to be adjudicated and potentially counted. Provisional ballots are used when there is an issue at an in-person polling place, like if it’s unclear if someone is registered or if they show up at the wrong precinct. The county examines the provisional ballots and verifies that the voter was eligible – so some, but not all, of these 5,555 ballots will count.\n\nA Nevada Republican strategist told CNN on Saturday that the mood inside Laxalt’s campaign was “awful” and that different factions of the candidate’s operation have begun the internal blame game, feeling it is a forgone conclusion that Cortez Masto will take the lead soon.\n\nWhen asked by CNN to describe the mood inside Laxalt’s campaign, the strategist said, “Shocked and depressed.”\n\nIn response to CNN’s reporting, Laxalt’s press secretary, Brian Freimuth, said the campaign team “remains confident and hopeful, and any reporting to the contrary is inaccurate and poorly-sourced.”\n\nJosh Marcus-Blank, a spokesman for the Cortez Masto campaign, told CNN the campaign remains “confident.”\n\nLaxalt on Saturday acknowledged his narrowing lead over Cortez Masto in the too-close-to-call race, tweeting that the mostly mail-in ballots being counted were favoring Democrats by higher margins than expected.\n\n“This has narrowed our victory window. The race will come down to 20-30K Election Day Clark drop off ballots,” Laxalt tweeted.\n\n“If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us,” he added.\n\nLaxalt, a former state attorney general, has previously made false claims about the 2020 election in Nevada. A co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign in the Silver State, he played a leading role in post-election legal efforts to reverse Joe Biden’s victory in the state.\n\nMagic wall: John King breaks down latest Nevada Senate numbers 02:38 - Source: CNN\n\nMaricopa County reports 80,000 ballots, more to go\n\nArizona’s Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, reported about 80,000 more votes late Friday evening, which included many of the mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling places on Election Day.\n\nThere are about 275,000 ballots left to count in county, according to Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates.\n\nGates said he expects that if they continue counting at the same pace – around 60,000 to 80,000 ballots a day – the county should be done counting by “very early next week.”\n\nPima County, Arizona’s second-most populous and home to Tucson, is expected to have roughly 85,000 ballots left to count at the end of Friday, Constance Hargrove, elections director for the county, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and John King on Friday.\n\nHargove said that she hopes by Monday that Pima County will have the majority of the remaining votes counted. She had previously told CNN that all the votes would be counted by Monday morning. On Friday night, however, she clarified that would no longer be the case due to a large batch of around 80,000 votes received from the recorder’s office earlier that day.\n\nIn a speech in Phoenix, on Saturday, Kelly thanked state elections officials, “honorable Republicans and Democrats, who are doing the important work of making sure that Arizonans’ votes and voices are heard – their votes are counted as quickly and as transparently as possible.”\n\nMasters was not ready to concede, tweeting Saturday that “we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted.”\n\n“If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory,” he added.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, here with his wife, former US Rep. Gabby Giffords, declares victory in his reelection race at a rally in Phoenix on November 12, 2022. Jim Urquhart/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of Lake gathered outside the Maricopa election center on Saturday. Gates told CNN’s Jim Acosta that officials have every reason to believe it will remain peaceful and he asked for patience from everyone.\n\n“The folks here in the building, they’re aware of what’s going on outside,” Gates said, adding:” We have every reason to be believe that they will continue to be peaceful.”\n\nHe continued: “The people in Maricopa County overwhelmingly appreciate the work that’s being done by these folks, the long hours that they’re working, but people are excited to get the results and I completely understand that. We just ask for their patience.”\n\nRepublicans attack the counting\n\nGates on Saturday accused Masters of spreading “misinformation” about the vote-count process, as election workers continue to tally the remaining votes in Maricopa.\n\n“It’s really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” Gates told Acosta when asked about GOP accusations that the count is too slow. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long,”\n\nGates, a Republican, added: “These allegations that are being made by some of the candidates and other political activists that this count is taking too long … those folks are not paying attention to the history of how we have counted votes here in Arizona for decades now. The average time over the last couple of decades to get through our count is 10 to 12 days.”\n\nThis comes after Gates pushed back against allegations of misconduct from Masters, the Republican National Committee, and the Republican Party of Arizona on Friday night, saying they were “offensive” to the election workers.\n\n“The suggestion by the Republican National Committee that there is something untoward going on here in Maricopa County is absolutely false and again, is offensive to these good elections workers,” he said.\n\nOn Friday night, the RNC and the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted a statement criticizing the county’s process, and demanding that it require “around-the-clock shifts of ballot processing” until all of the votes are counted, along with “regular, accurate public updates.” The groups also threatened that they would “not hesitate to take legal action if necessary.”\n\nAddressing the specific accusations from the RNC statement, Gates said: “I would prefer that if there are concerns that they have, that they communicate those to us here. I’m a Republican. Three of my colleagues on the board are Republicans. Raise these issues with us and discuss them with us, as opposed to making these baseless claims.”\n\n“They’re hyping up the rhetoric here, which is exactly what we don’t need to do,” he added.\n\nResponding to claims that the count is “taking too long,” Gates said the county’s pace is in line with previous years.\n\n“Over the past couple of decades, on average it takes 10 to 12 days to complete the count. That’s not because of anything Maricopa County has decided to do. That’s because of how Arizona law is set up, and that’s what we do here at Maricopa County, we follow the law to make sure that the count is accurate.”\n\nHear Arizona election official shut down Blake Masters's allegation of ballot mixing 03:09 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother potential wrench in Arizona certification\n\nAfter suffering setbacks in court, Arizona officials who have sought to conduct a hand count audit of a rural county’s election results are considering a scaled-down version of their plan that could still inject chaos and delay into the process of certifying the state’s results.\n\nThe confrontation in Cochise County has led to worries of potential delays in determining the winners in a state where key races remain too close to call. The current deadline for Arizona counties to certify results is November 28 – or 20 days after the final day of voting.\n\nCochise County, home to roughly 125,000 Arizonans, had planned to audit 100% of ballots by hand, one of several places where there’s been a push to hand-count elections as a result of Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Thursday, a state appeals court made clear in a 2-1 vote that it would not be reversing a court order barring the full hand count in time for the plan to be revived for the midterms. But a lawyer for Cochise County Recorder David Stevens – a proponent of the hand audit – said that the county isn’t giving up on its efforts to conduct a hand count that goes beyond the usual procedures.\n\nElection fallout for both House and Senate GOP leaders\n\nTrump, who saw several key endorsed candidates fizzle out in the general election, is trying to cast blame on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and gin up opposition to the Kentucky Republican ahead of Senate GOP leadership elections next week, CNN reported Friday.\n\nWhile McConnell has locked down enough support to remain leader, he is facing calls from Senate Republicans to delay next week’s leadership contests – which several GOP sources said is unlikely.\n\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, is facing new headwinds from the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, who are withholding their support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and beginning to lay out a list of demands.\n\nIf Republicans win the House, McCarthy’s task of becoming speaker is more complicated than McConnell’s because he needs 218 votes to win the gavel – not just a majority of Republicans.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry met with McCarthy in his office Friday. He said afterward that the meeting “went well” but wouldn’t say if McCarthy has his – or the Freedom Caucus’ – support for speaker.\n\n“We’re having discussions,” Perry said.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/gop-midterms-trump-2024/index.html", "title": "Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid disappointing GOP ...", "text": "Palm Beach, Florida CNN —\n\nDonald Trump wanted to catapult himself into a third presidential campaign with a wave of Republican midterm gains behind him. Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary.\n\nWith key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses.\n\nHis chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.\n\nAs powerful as Trump is in the Republican Party, we learned that he cannot anoint anyone a winner. You still need candidates who have the fundamentals,” said Bryan Lanza, a longtime Trump adviser.\n\nOthers were more blunt in their assessment of Tuesday’s known outcomes.\n\nEx-Trump official: Election shows that Trump is holding GOP back 00:49 - Source: CNN\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who won reelection and was endorsed by Trump, appeared to cast the former president as a drag on other GOP candidates in a radio interview Wednesday.\n\n“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Nehls said. In a statement to CNN after this story published, the congressman said he remains supportive of Trump and “will support him as the 47th president.”\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, a current Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, conceded that Trump “is in a tough spot coming out of tonight.”\n\n“Two narratives are going to take hold over the next week and neither one is going to be easy to dispel,” the adviser said.\n\nAcutely aware of his unprecedented involvement in Republican primaries earlier this year, this adviser and other Trump allies said they expect the former president will be blamed for elevating flawed candidates in some of the party’s most important contests – especially Oz, a daytime talk show host who had barely resided in Pennsylvania before launching his Senate campaign there.\n\nTrump’s disappointment was palpable inside the gilded ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he gathered with dozens of aides, allies and donors to watch returns on Tuesday evening. When he returned to the party halfway through the night following a private dinner, his mood had visibly shifted.\n\n“Interesting evening,” he shouted to reporters before taking the stage for brief and unenthused remarks.\n\nAs the crowd dwindled, Trump sat at a table in front of a television tuned to Fox News with just a handful of advisers. Meanwhile, several guests whose names appeared on a VIP list that one Trump adviser circulated to reporters were nowhere to be found, including some who apparently decided to skip the event – surfacing as television pundits throughout the night from studios elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe end result was the exact scenario Trump’s advisers had hoped to avoid: an election where his top recruits fizzled or flopped and his primary Republican rival soared to new stardom.\n\nSources familiar with the matter said Trump left the party at the end of the night in a sour mood and resentful of the attention on DeSantis, who won reelection with a monstrous margin of victory and became the first Republican governor to carry Miami-Dade County, a densely populated and diverse area, for the first time in two decades. Just hours before the Florida governor’s victory, Trump had trashed DeSantis in comments to reporters aboard his 757 plane, threatening to dish unflattering information about him and suggesting he could have been more “gracious” for Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 bid for the governor’s mansion.\n\n“It wasn’t a great night for Trump and makes 2024 more competitive,” said one Republican operative.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump was in touch with allies in early 2024 voting states as he worked to develop a message that could carry him forward, according to two people briefed on those talks. In Iowa, Trump plans to tout Republican Brenna Bird’s defeat of incumbent Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller even though he didn’t endorse Bird until November 5, three days before her election.\n\nAs he works to plot his next steps, one of the biggest questions he is grappling with is how to approach DeSantis, sources said.\n\nBefore his resounding success on Tuesday, the Florida governor “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity,” said one Trump adviser.\n\n“We’ve got to figure out how to get it back before next Tuesday,” the Trump adviser added, referring to the “big announcement” Trump has teased for November 15, when he is expected to formally declare his third campaign for the White House. DeSantis’ strength was reflected in CNN exit polls on Tuesday, which showed the Republican governor exceeding President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory among Latino voters in Florida and maintaining a small edge among independents, which Biden carried in the state by 11 points two years ago.\n\nBoth data points could prove compelling GOP primary between DeSantis and Trump, who made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in some 2020 states but not to the degree of the Florida Republican.\n\nTwo people close to the former president said he backed himself into a corner by publicly setting a date for his expected campaign announcement before the outcome of the midterm elections was known, something he did at an Ohio campaign rally on election eve to compromise with allies who did not want him to use the event as the launch site for his campaign.\n\n“He has to [announce],” said a source close to Trump, adding that it is too late for him to back out. “It would be embarrassing.”\n\nAnother Trump ally noted it would be “less embarrassing to delay than to get out there to a bunch of silence.”\n\nSome in Trump’s circle hoped a runoff in Georgia could help the former president delay the announcement and save face.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said that Herschel Walker – who will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff, CNN projected Wednesday – should be the priority.\n\n“I’ll be advising him to delay it until after the Georgia runoff, assuming that’s where the race is still trending,” Miller said.\n\nOthers expect that advice will fall on deaf ears. One source noted that Trump had so far been resistant to arguments that he should postpone his announcement and as of Wednesday morning, it was still unclear to some of the former president’s closest aides how he would handle his 2024 ambitions. Would he proceed defiantly – launching a campaign with disregard for the potential obstacles that lie ahead – or entertain a rare recalculation?\n\n“I could see him claiming that Republicans didn’t turn out in droves because he wasn’t on the ballot and blaming everyone but himself,” said one of his advisers.\n\nDesire to be a kingmaker\n\nFor Trump, Tuesday’s underwhelming results followed months of intense engagement in a midterm cycle that marked a notable departure from the post-presidential activities of his modern predecessors. As early as last summer, he began working to recruit candidates for key Senate contests who would advance his false claims about the 2020 election.\n\n“He wanted to be seen as a legendary kingmaker,” said a former Trump campaign official.\n\nBy this spring, Trump was directly meddling in contested primaries – endorsing candidates he deemed to be the most MAGA, criticizing their opponents in statements and Truth Social posts, and patently ignoring advice from some of his advisers to remain on the sidelines until the general election began. Trump often argued that his involvement would pay dividends in the end, not only ushering in majorities in both congressional chambers but ensuring elected officials loyal to him – not the party – were installed in Washington and key governor’s mansions.\n\nIn many cases, even candidates that Trump didn’t endorse emblazoned their campaign websites with his image or familiar phrases like “America First” or “MAGA fighter.” Throughout the cycle, GOP contenders regularly trekked to Mar-a-Lago to seek his support. Others shelled out thousands of dollars to host fundraising events at the waterfront property, hoping the former president would take note of their devotion and reward them with an endorsement.\n\nTrump ended the cycle by spending more than $16 million through his MAGA Inc. super PAC in the final weeks to boost many of his hand-picked candidates and link his top Democratic targets to Biden, who has grappled with sinking favorability during his first two years in office. Hours before results began pouring in on Tuesday, Trump’s team circulated a memo touting his “unprecedented success in 2022” that quantified his campaign trail appearances and assistance to Republican candidates.\n\n“President Donald J. Trump has endorsed over 330 candidates this election cycle,” the memo read, adding that Trump has “raised nearly $350 million” for GOP candidates and the party overall since leaving office.\n\nWith votes still being tabulated in some states, it is unclear just how many of the hundreds of candidates who earned Trump’s endorsement prevailed on Tuesday. What is clear is that Trump allies entered Tuesday night believing it would be an undeniable success for the 45th president.\n\nAs he gathered with other Trump campaign alums at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Miller described the former president as a “juggernaut” at the beginning of the evening.\n\n“It will be a much different-looking party now because of the Trump MAGA movement,” Miller had predicted.\n\nAsked about the 330 endorsements that could make or break his political future, Trump himself began the night suggesting that he should emerge on the other side of the midterms unblemished, telling NewsNation hours before polls closed, “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional statement from Rep.

None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” the report states.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department’s investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.\n\nTrump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the “highly partisan” report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report:\n\nTrump and his inner circle engaged in ‘at least 200’ attempts to pressure state officials\n\nIn an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in “at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,” between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.\n\nTrump “spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,” the report says. (He lost all of those states.)\n\nFor example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a “litany of false election-fraud claims” and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by “finding” just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.\n\nTrump infamously said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.”\n\nCommittee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot\n\nThe January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nConservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot.\n\n“The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,” the report says.\n\nIt was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee’s conclusion about his leadership role is new.\n\nThe effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020.\n\nThe committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a “‘President of the Senate’ strategy,” which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro – an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor – was central to the creation of the plan,” the report says. “Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan’s foundation.”\n\nCNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded.\n\nTrump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo\n\nEastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory.\n\nEastman emailed Trump’s assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. “Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.”\n\nThe committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman’s phone records. Eastman’s two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure “President Trump is re-elected,” even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee.\n\nThese new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.\n\nThe committee obtained Eastman’s emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.\n\nTrump latched onto Eastman’s theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6.\n\nJanuary 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again\n\nBarring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.\n\nThe panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution” can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.\n\nIt calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a “formal mechanism” for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.\n\nSays lawyers should be held responsible\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.\n\n“Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report” the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having “conflicts of interests” for the Department of Justice to evaluate.\n\nThe report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.\n\nAlthough the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction “develop legislation” to create “a cause of action” for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.\n\nElectoral Count Act reform\n\nOne recommendation may soon become reality.\n\nThe panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power.\n\nThe House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation.\n\nCommittee refers Trump to Justice Department\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary first released Monday says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the report states.\n\nThe committee also revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” it adds, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nMillions of dollars were raised on false claims, but RNC showed caution to not go too far\n\nThe committee investigators describe how Trump campaign and Republican National Committee fundraising pitches containing false claims of a stolen election ultimately raised more than $250 million – but were met internally with some resistance.\n\nInvestigators describe three options that were considered for a post-election fundraising appeal by the campaign. One option, that the campaign opted against using because they knew it was false, said that Trump had won. A second unused option said the campaign was waiting on results. Ultimately, according to the committee, the Trump campaign approved a message that Democrats are going to “try to steal the election” that was written before election night.\n\nThe committee describes, based on interview with Trump campaign officials, that much of the material in the fundraising emails was based on messages said by Trump – but were not checked for accuracy before being used to ask for donations.\n\n“President Trump’s claims were treated as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked with ensuring accuracy,” the committee wrote.\n\nTrump campaign’s deputy director of communications and research Zach Parkinson told investigators that reviews for accuracy were limited to “questions concerning items such as time and location.”\n\nThe RNC did eventually tone down some messages, which the committee suggests shows “the RNC knew that President’s Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless” and made “changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure,” according to investigators.\n\nHouse investigators said that RNC lawyers directed copywriters not to use the term “rigged,” according to interviews conducted by the committee. The panel obtained several examples of fundraising appeals that were toned down to be accurate and less inflammatory.\n\nTrump privately called some of Sidney Powell’s election claims ‘crazy’\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks told the January 6 committee that Donald Trump had laughed at one of his election lawyer’s claims about foreign powers interfering in the election, calling them “crazy,” according to the committee’s final report.\n\n“The day after the press conference, President Trump spoke by phone with Sidney Powell from the Oval Office. During the call, Powell repeated the same claims of foreign interference in the election she had made at the press conference,” the report said, referring to conspiratorial claims made by Powell, Trump’s onetime attorney, at an outlandish press conference after the 2020 election.\n\n“While she was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?’” the report says.\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell falsely claimed, among other things, that widely used voting machines from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems featured software created “at the direction” of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros.\n\n“A few days later, the Trump campaign issued a statement claiming Powell was not part of the Trump campaign’s legal team. But Powell’s outlandish claims were no different from those President Trump was making himself,” the committee writes.\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nPro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states.\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nAide characterized Trump’s tone on January 6 as, ‘can you believe this sh*t?’\n\nTrump’s tone during his last known phone call on January 6 was like, “wow, can you believe this sh*t?” according to the White House aide who spoke with him that night.\n\nIn newly revealed testimony included in the January 6 committee’s final report, the aide, John McEntee, said Trump told him “[t]his is a crazy day.” The report added, “McEntee said his tone was one of “like, wow, can you believe this sh*t?”\n\nTrump did not express any sadness over the violence that had unfolded at the Capitol that day, McEntee told the panel.\n\n“I think he was shocked by, you know, it getting a little out of control, but I don’t remember sadness, specifically” McEntee said.\n\nHe wasn’t the only person with that impression about Trump’s mood.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser at the time, told the select committee her father was “disappointed and surprised” by the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut when pressed by committee investigators, she could not provide any instances of the president discussing whether or not he did the right thing on January 6 or speaking about those who were injured or died that day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Devan Cole Geneva Sands Katelyn Polantz Hannah Rabinowitz", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Devan Cole", "Geneva Sands", "Katelyn Polantz", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000.

She's suing police, the school district and a gunmaker.\n\nCOVID is under control but vigilance necessary, says Biden\n\nWhile COVID-19 deaths are down nearly 90%, and the end of the public health emergency is close, Biden said the country will remember the pain of losing loved ones will never go away for many.\n\n“Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. He urged Congress to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nThe COVID emergency declaration is ending:What it means for tests, vaccines, treatment\n\nBiden: Police departments 'must be held accountable'\n\nSaying Tyre Nichols’ mother wants something good to come from his death at the hands of police officers in Memphis, Biden called for police reform.\n\n“When police officers or departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable,” he said.\n\nBiden also pointed to an executive order he signed affecting federal officers that banned chokeholds, restricted no-knock warrants, and implemented “other key elements of the George Floyd Act.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nTyre Nichols:Ex-Memphis police officer took a photo of Tyre Nichols after beating, document says\n\nBiden urges Congress to act on labor reform\n\nBiden called for Congress to take up labor reform and worker protections as he touted his support for unions and his pledge to be “the most pro-union president.”\n\n“I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing,” said Biden. “Workers have a right to form a union.”\n\nBiden also urged action on additional worker protections and benefits, including paid family and medical leave and affordable child care, specifically calling for the return of the expanded Child Tax Credit.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nLabor secretary makes move:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBiden calls for rebooting the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nParents who qualify for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) won’t be getting as hefty checks as last year. That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023? Here's what you need to know about qualifying.\n\nBiden: Ban ‘junk fees’ on hotel bills, other services\n\nBiden urged Congress to pass legislation to ban excess fees that companies often tack onto hotel bills, airline tickets and other services.\n\n“Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” he said.\n\nThe Junk Fee Prevention Act, if approved, would bar so-called “resort fees” that can add up to $90 a night on hotel bills, stop cable internet and cell phone companies from charging up to $200 more when a customer switches providers, and prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families to sit together, Biden said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJunk fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nSocial Security and Medicare benefits draw tension during speech\n\nBiden’s State of the Union address comes as he and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have started talks on the debt ceiling and government spending.\n\nTension has been building between the two parties over Social Security and Medicare benefits. McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets? Answers here\n\nBiden calls climate crisis ‘an existential threat’\n\nBiden said “the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state” as he touted his administration’s work to take on what he called “an existential threat.”\n\nHe pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest climate package ever, and investments from his infrastructure law.\n\nHe later went off-script, saying, “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUN Secretary-General::'No more baby steps' on climate change\n\nBiden to Congress: Continue insurance subsidies that lowered uninsured rates\n\nBiden celebrated the fact that a record number of Americans have health insurance while calling on Congress to continue expanded insurance subsidies that helped boost that rate.\n\nThose enhanced subsidies for people who purchase insurance on their own, instead of getting coverage from the government or an employer, expire after 2025.\n\n“Let’s finish the job and make the savings permanent,” Biden said as he also called for extending expanded Medicaid coverage to all states.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden takes made in America a step further\n\nBiden touted American manufacturing gains and a campaign promise to move more production to the U.S. from foreign countries. Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections.

Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience.

But they do have something in common.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov.

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year.

Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/jill-biden-2024-campaign/index.html", "title": "Jill Biden makes a tidal shift from her thoughts on another run at the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, despite being so worn out from a recent circuit of White House events that she lost her voice, is now seriously looking ahead to her husband running for reelection in 2024. That’s a tidal shift from her position just three months ago.\n\nSeven people familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNN that her private conversations about another run now match her publicly enthusiastic persona, as well as the sentiments of President Joe Biden.\n\nThe first lady was still mostly skeptical as of early fall – “not a proponent,” as one person familiar with her thinking told CNN. But in the month since the November midterm elections, in which Democrats defied the fate of most parties of first-term presidents, friends noted a change.\n\nJill Biden is now “all in” on the idea, according to a person who works with the East Wing.\n\nEven though the last several weeks of high-profile events have left her “exhausted,” said another person, “she has begun to say the quiet part out loud.”\n\nAt a town hall the other day, for example, Biden empathized with parents and grandparents about holiday stress, lamenting the demands on her own time.\n\n“This time of year is busy, to say the least,” she said. “I know that you probably have holiday shopping to do, cards to address or cookies to bake. … It’s not easy, is it? Sometimes all these feel like a full-time job, on top of volunteering or organizing or your real full-time job.”\n\nAs soon as her remarks were over, she tagged out and let other speakers finish the event while she hustled to the next task.\n\nThe Biden family conversations about 2024 were supposed to be on track for Christmas, however, CNN has learned from three of the people familiar that the clan is not expected to be in the same place all at the same time this year, making convening for a debate or a consensus more complicated.\n\n“She’ll be at the White House for Christmas. They will be joined by members of their families,” said Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, who declined further comment on family discussions.\n\nThe West Wing has long been in “he’s running” mode, with a political operation for 2024 already in the works. It’s an apparatus that has had to get started out of necessity before an official announcement. “As the president has said, he intends to run for reelection and that is something both Dr. Biden and the family fully support,” a senior adviser to Jill Biden told CNN.\n\nRecent polling, however, suggests a large swath of the Democratic Party may not be eager to see the president run again. A new CNN poll shows 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they’d like to see someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in 2024 – similar to the percentage of Republicans and Republican-leaners (62%) who say they’d prefer to see their party nominate someone other than former President Donald Trump. At the same time, though, when pressed, a majority of Democratic-aligned voters with opposition to Biden as their party’s nominee say they would vote for him in a general election if he won their party’s primary.\n\nThe first lady, and she alone, has the full weight of kibosh; she can still stop what seems inevitable in a political calculus if she has concerns about her husband’s age or how another run would affect his legacy or their family. She has been a “no” vote on his higher office aspirations before – most notably in 2004, and again in 2015.\n\nAnother presidential campaign would mean more for her, too. Joe Biden’s reelection plan, if he runs, will depend heavily on his wife’s involvement. Her likability in purple and red states, as well as her own energy and endurance, are crucial to his game plan, said two people with insight into the 2024 campaign strategy. It was Jill Biden, not the president, who barnstormed more than a dozen states in the midterms, chalking up at least 39 appearances at fundraisers and speaking engagements to support candidates up and down the ballot. Asked if the first lady is prepared to hit the trail even harder for a 2024 bid, the senior Biden adviser told CNN, “She is ready and fully supportive.”\n\nBut heading into her holiday break, Biden is coming off a physically and emotionally taxing period, said those who know her. Though still leaning into the presumption a second term is in the cards, the last two weeks have nonetheless run her ragged with the obligatory duties that the often-introverted first lady finds most draining, sources close to her said.\n\nIn addition to the recent wedding of her granddaughter, and the administration’s first State Dinner, hundreds of invited guests have been streaming through the White House over the last several days for dozens of holiday parties. On Wednesday, Biden and the president hosted yet another large-scale social event, a formal dinner in the East Room of the White House, for African nation leaders and their spouses in Washington this week for a summit. Jill Biden was also charged with planning and hosting events for the spouses on Wednesday and Thursday, when a luncheon at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture will occupy a chunk of her day.\n\n“She still has laryngitis, and is hoarse,” said a source familiar with the first lady’s rigorous schedule, alluding to Biden’s noticeably altered voice at speaking engagements this week. “She had three back-to-back parties on Saturday alone.”\n\n“It has been a busy month,” said Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director, when asked by CNN about Biden losing her voice.\n\nThat voice is the most influential to her husband’s decision making and thus will have to be the loudest when the time does come for him to announce his plans for 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrive with Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff for a bill signing ceremony for the Respect for Marriage Act on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nFirst lady veto power\n\nJoe Biden is buzzing from Democrats’ midterm performance – they retained the Senate and held off Republicans from a red wave in the House – some improving economic data, successful Asia summits and the release of Brittney Griner. He is telling people he has what it takes more than ever to go up against Trump – or whoever the ultimate GOP nominee may be.\n\nThough more squarely in the “we’re doing it” corner than she was even three months ago, Jill Biden still considers whether her husband, now 80, is up for a bruising battle, according to those familiar with her thinking.\n\n“[Jill Biden] is the one more aware of how the last few years have affected Joe [Biden,]” noted a person with ties to the Biden family. “We – collectively, as a country – all know the age issue, sure. But she’s the one who is consistently able to analyze it.”\n\nThe senior Biden official said the first lady has “zero concerns” about the president’s schedule and stamina.\n\nJill Biden is also the tender of Joe Biden’s legacy. Like so many first ladies before her, she can look down the road to what’s coming, how ready her husband is for it and what the best-case scenario may be. For the last two years, whenever the topic of a second term arose, she spoke of it as an inevitability, said those who have spent time working with her. She would default to saying things like “after the reelect” or “in the second term.”\n\nBut a deeper analysis of what that would mean for Joe Biden’s legacy has only come more recently for the first lady, said others who have had more insight into conversations.\n\nLast month, Biden’s big birthday made him the first octogenarian president of the United States. Jill Biden, 71, doesn’t want that to be the marker that leads every article and analysis about her husband after he has departed the Oval Office, friends and associates said.\n\nShe wants his political successes – current and future – to supersede the image of a frail and aged commander in chief.\n\nBut she’s still uncertain how to shift that narrative in practice. “She is not convinced whether four more years will help or hurt,” said one of the people who know her, discussing the potency of the age issue.\n\nJoe Biden’s timeline for an announcement on his future might not wait for the first lady to reconcile the problem.\n\n“The president will make that decision. I expect it shortly after the holiday,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, at a Wall Street Journal summit earlier this month. “I expect his decision will be to do it.”\n\nThe president has teased an announcement for months now, publicly saying he intends to run for reelection, often adding in the next breath he will discuss it with his wife and family first.\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nJill Biden is keenly aware of the influence she has had on her husband’s political trajectory. And this decision, while perhaps easier for Joe Biden to make as an incumbent, is no less hinged upon the blessing of the first lady. Jill Biden, as “Nana” to her grandchildren and matriarchal keeper of normalcy and tradition, has her eye on what a second term could mean for them, said the people who know her.\n\n“She has always had one foot in Delaware, and she’s the one who thinks about every possible scenario that could play out for her family,” said someone who has known her for several years. As she crosses from “highly possible” into “certainty” territory for 2024, Biden is considering how the campaign could impact her son, Hunter Biden, who has long been a target of the president’s political opponents, and could face more investigations into his business dealings with a GOP-led House. She wants to mitigate as much as possible the strain a campaign could have on her children, and, by extension, her grandchildren, several of whom are either on the cusp of entering adulthood or already there. (With the exception of Hunter Biden’s son, Beau, who is 2.)\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAsked by members of the media a couple of weeks later over Thanksgiving – a holiday he spent with Jill Biden, Hunter Biden and his wife and son, and Ashley Biden, in Nantucket, Massachusetts – how those family discussions about 2024 were coming along, the president said they weren’t. “We’re not having any. We’re celebrating,” he responded.\n\nWith the clock on the 2024 announcement ticking, Jill Biden has one more shot at away-from-Washington alone-time with her husband, when she could wrap her head around what “all in” actually entails.\n\nThe couple heads to the warmer climes of St. Croix between Christmas and New Year’s; laying in the sun with a book is a favored activity for the first lady.\n\n“Well, I – my guess is – I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away for a week,” the president said at his November post-election news conference at the White House, where Jill Biden sat in the front row. “And my guess is it would be early next year we make that judgment.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/politics/ronna-mcdaniel-election-deniers-midterms-cnntv/index.html", "title": "RNC chairwoman says Republicans will accept election results after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Sunday that candidates from her party would accept the results of the midterm elections after letting “the process play out.”\n\n“Listen, you should have a recount. You should have a canvass, and it’ll go to the courts and then everybody should accept the results,” McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” when asked for a yes-or-no answer to whether all GOP candidates should accept the upcoming election results.\n\nAsked by Bash about Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson declining to commit to accepting the midterm results, McDaniel sought to compare his remarks to past comments by Democrats.\n\n“Well, I would say the same to Stacey Abrams, right. Or Hillary Clinton, who’s already saying, in 2024, we are going to rig the election. That’s not helpful,” she said, before later adding, “We’ll let the process play out and then we’ll accept the results.”\n\nThe comments come two days before the critical midterm elections, in which Republicans are hoping to wrestle back control of the House and wipe away Democrats’ razor-thin majority in the Senate. Already, some GOP candidates have been casting doubt about the legitimacy of the forthcoming results, similar to what then-President Donald Trump and his allies did in the run-up to the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson, who is in a competitive reelection fight for a third term, would not commit last week to accepting the upcoming election results, telling reporters in Wisconsin, “Let’s see how this plays out.”\n\n“I sure hope I can, but I can’t predict what the Democrats might have planned,” he said.\n\n“I think Ron Johnson and Stacey Abrams in the end, once all their avenues are exhausted, they’ll accept the results,” McDaniel told Bash on Sunday, referring to Georgia’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee, whose refusal to initially “concede” following her loss to Republican Brian Kemp in their 2018 contest has been seized on by Republicans looking to cast doubt on election legitimacy.\n\nAbrams has argued that Kemp, who was then serving as the Georgia’s secretary of state, and other state GOP leaders used the tools of the state to suppress the vote four years ago. But she acknowledged Kemp’s certification as governor and that she no longer had legal avenues.\n\nClinton said last month in a video for a progressive group, “Right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election, and they’re not making a secret of it.”\n\nShe went on to add that the conservative majority on the US Supreme Court could give state legislatures more power in overturning elections.\n\nMcDaniel also defended the practice of poll watching when asked about instances of voter intimidation throughout the country, but added: “We absolutely want them to abide by the law, and if they don’t, then they shouldn’t be allowed to do that.”\n\n“Nobody should be intimidating or breaking the law, nobody should. But poll watching is not intimidating,” she said. “If you’ve been at a poll place, you see, they’re just simply observing and it helps us, at the end, give assurance to the voters (and) say, ‘listen, we were there, we watched it, it went well.’”\n\nMcDaniel also predicted that Republicans would take back both chambers of Congress in the midterm elections and stressed that if they do, President Joe Biden will have a mandate from Americans to work with Republicans.\n\n“If we win back the House and the Senate, it’s the American people saying to Joe Biden, ‘we want you to work on behalf of us and we want you to work across the aisle and solve the problems that we are dealing with.’ Bill Clinton did that, right? After ’94, when he lost those midterms, he came across and said, ‘Let’s work together.’ It would be interesting to see if President Biden does that,” she said.\n\nAnd McDaniel avoided weighing in on Trump’s plans to possibly announce a 2024 White House bid later this month, saying simply: “I’m only focused on 2022.”\n\nCNN reported last week that top aides to Trump have discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 campaign if Republicans fare well in this week’s elections, according to sources familiar with the matter.", "authors": ["Devan Cole Sarah Fortinsky", "Devan Cole", "Sarah Fortinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/politics/texas-gop-convention-resolution/index.html", "title": "Texas GOP adopts resolution rejecting 2020 election results | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Republican Party of Texas over the weekend adopted a resolution at its state convention that rejects President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election, further aligning the state party establishment with former President Donald Trump in pushing false election claims.\n\n“We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States,” reads the resolution, passed by voice vote in Houston on Saturday. “We strongly urge all Republicans to work to ensure election integrity and to show up to vote in November of 2022, bring your friends and family, volunteer for your local Republicans, and overwhelm any possible fraud.”\n\nBefore the final resolution was adopted, Brian Bodine, a platform committee member who says he wrote the resolution, proposed an amendment about the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. It asserted that the “rights of those charged with crimes have been violated” and rejected the “narrative” that events at the US Capitol represented an insurrection. The proposal drew applause and “Let’s go Brandon” chants. Matt Rinaldi, chairman of the committee, ruled the amendment was out of order and would not be considered.\n\nThe platform also included a section calling homosexuality “an abnormal lifestyle choice” and opposing “all efforts to validate transgender identity.”\n\nThe state party’s platform has not yet been finalized, James Wesolek, a spokesperson for the Texas GOP, told CNN, but votes are being tallied on each individual plank.\n\nAlso, during the convention, Texas Sen.

That’s what I’ve heard from many of you here today and this week, and that’s what we’re working on – nothing more, and nothing less.”\n\nThe party also nearly unanimously adopted a resolution by voice vote on Saturday rejecting the bipartisan gun agreement and rebuking Cornyn and other GOP negotiators, including Sens.

Dan Crenshaw, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said that the party has a “lot of good options” and he hopes “they all jump in” to the race. The Texas Republican added that he does not think Trump would be the automatic frontrunner if he decides to launch a third White House bid.\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune told CNN that there will be “other attractive” Republican candidates in 2024 besides Trump, echoing recent comments from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who predicted it will be a crowded field.\n\nAnd Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican and member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said he thinks it would be healthy for the GOP to have a debate about who should be their next standard-bearer.\n\n“I certainly hope we’ll have a crowded field so we can have a robust discussion,” Johnson told CNN. “Trump’s going to have a certain amount of built-in support. So yeah, he’s gonna be ahead in early polls. But I also know that these primaries hardly ever go as scripted.”\n\n“So that’s why you gotta let the process play out,” he added.\n\nWhile Trump still maintains more support among Republicans than any other would-be challenger, there are growing fears inside the GOP about Trump’s potential legal woes and political baggage, which has some lawmakers eying the party’s bench of alternative options, according to Republicans granted anonymity to speak more freely. There is particular concern in GOP circles about the criminal investigation out of the Fulton County District Attorney’s office, which is probing the plot by Trump and his allies to appoint false electors in Georgia in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nAs Crenshaw put it: it would “suck” to select a GOP nominee that winds up getting indicted, though he said he is making no predictions about the outcome of those investigations.\n\n“I won’t be supporting Donald Trump for president or anything else,” said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a leading anti-Trump voice in the GOP who voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials. “I think he’s hurt our party and I think he continues to do so.”\n\nStill, most Republicans – even those who are apprehensive about another Trump bid – are signaling they’d fall in line if he ultimately throws his hat into the ring and prevails in the primary.\n\n“It’s always been my practice to support the nominee,” Thune said when asked if he would back Trump as the GOP nominee even if he questioned his fitness for office.\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has publicly revealed damaging details about Trump’s role in the Capitol attack, the former President has begun to weigh an early White House bid – potentially even before the midterms – in an effort to both freeze the field and shift the narrative. His fiercest allies have welcomed the idea of another Trump run.\n\n“Speaker Pelosi’s January 6th Committee is nothing more than a partisan sham. The American people see right through it,” House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik said in a statement to CNN. “I strongly support President Trump, and hope he runs again in 2024. And if the election were held today, there is no question he would beat Joe Biden handily.”\n\nEven with the threat of Trump running again, a number of Republicans have begun to explore potential presidential bids and meet with donors. Some of them have not ruled out directly challenging Trump for the nomination if he decides to get in the race.\n\nRep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican and member of the RSC, told CNN he thinks it would be “great” to see multiple candidates compete for the party nomination, noting that while he would “probably” back Trump, he is also friends with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – both former House members.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection, agreed, saying they ought to see “who has all the best ideas.”\n\n2024 hopefuls get a stage on Capitol Hill\n\nThe Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus on Capitol Hill, has hosted a number of these 2024 hopefuls over the past year – including Pompeo, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley – and offered them a platform to share their vision and build congressional alliances. The group has also met numerous times with Trump.\n\nMost recently, the group met with former Vice President Mike Pence, who telegraphed in several high-profile moves last week that he is actively exploring a 2024 presidential bid and working to gain a foothold in Trump-fatigued corners of the Republican Party.\n\n“That’s what has made the RSC important, is that we’ve been planting the flag for where the party goes from here,” Rep. Jim Banks, a fellow Indiana Republican who chairs the Republican Study Committee, told CNN. “The RSC has always believed that if we adopt the Trump agenda as our party platform, then our party will be stronger and healthier than ever before.”\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with the RSC on Wednesday, some members thanked Pence for his actions on January 6 – when he oversaw the certification of the 2020 election results – and others encouraged him to run for president in 2024, according to attendees.\n\n“I’m a fan of (Pence’s). I’m not here to push him one way or the other way,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican. “But I like his character.”\n\nGOP Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana said he hopes his brother decides to mount a bid for president and would support him “100%” if he did.\n\nWhen asked whether Pence sounded like someone with their eyes on the Oval Office, Johnson responded: “Anytime anybody who is not a sitting member of the House or Senate comes to DC and gives a speech, I think it’s a pretty fair assumption that they have at least some interest.”\n\nBanks has previously identified himself as an early supporter of a potential Pence 2024 campaign if Trump were to sit on the sidelines in the next election cycle. But Banks, who has emerged as one of Trump’s staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill and may be wary of seeming too supportive of one of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals, predicted on Wednesday Trump would clear the field and go on to win the White House if he decides to run.\n\n“If Donald Trump doesn’t run for president in ’24, then we have the best field we’ve ever had,” Banks said. “If Donald Trump does run, I think he clears the field, he’s the nominee and I think he wins in a landslide in November 2024.”\n\nOthers, however, may have a more difficult time choosing sides in a packed primary. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, told CNN he would support Trump if he announced a presidential run right now. But he also said the same of DeSantis.\n\n“It’s hard to play it out, because neither of them are stepping out” at the moment, Mast told CNN. “But in a hypothetical of things, both of them have my support.”\n\nSome Republicans dodged questions about 2024, saying they were focused on the upcoming midterms.\n\n“I’m not going to get involved in the presidential primary,” said Sen.

As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nClimate scientist Professor Hannah Cloke said that this year’s extreme weather events “ought to serve as a canary in the coal mine to spur faster action to adapt society to the reality of a changing climate”.\n\nHere are some of the most costly weather incidents recorded so far this year.\n\nRecord-breaking snowfall, Madrid In the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\nStorm Christoph, UK The period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\nCyclone Ana, Fiji Cyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\nWinter storms, Texas The Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\nDust storm, China Flights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\nFlooding, New South Wales In March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\nCyclone Seroja In April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\nRecord temperatures, Moscow As temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\nHeat dome, Pacific Northwest Soaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.

Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nTuesday is “expected to be even hotter,” according to the Met Office’s CEO, Penelope Endersby.\n\n“It’s tomorrow that we’re really seeing the higher chance of 40 degrees and temperatures above that,” Endersby told BBC Radio on Monday.\n\n“Even possibly above that, 41 is not off the cards. We’ve even got some 43s in the model but we’re hoping it won’t be as high as that.”\n\nIn France, the heat wave is expected to move away from the western part of the country on Tuesday, heading toward the center and eastern part instead, including Paris.\n\nBelgium’s Royal Meteorological Institute (KMI/IRM) has issued a “code red” weather warning for heat in two provinces on Tuesday, forecasting temperatures up to 40 Celsius in the west and southwest.\n\n“With such very high temperatures certain measures will be necessary: drink regularly, wear lighter clothes, spend the day in cooler rooms, monitor the state of your health regularly, eat easily digestible food (and in smaller portions), keep doors and windows closed to keep the heat out. Pets and animals also need extra care,” it warned residents.\n\nFacing drought\n\nNearly half of Europe’s territory, including the UK, is “at risk” of drought, researchers at the EU Commission said Monday.\n\nThe Joint Research Centre highlighted that the drought in much of Europe is “critical” as the “winter-spring precipitation deficit … was exacerbated by early heatwaves in May and June.”\n\nWater supply may be “compromised” in the coming months, according to the report.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Oxford University Professor Myles Allen warned that such heatwaves will be inevitable if mankind doesn’t soon reduce its carbon emissions.\n\n“This isn’t a new normal because we’re just on a trend towards ever hotter temperatures,” Allen told CNN on Monday.\n\nThe solution, he said, is sweeping change across the energy industry. Individual companies are unlikely to change their business models unilaterally due to concerns over losing competitiveness with rivals, he added.\n\n“It’s got to be a regulation on the industry as a whole,” said Allen.", "authors": ["Joseph Ataman Jimmy Hutcheon Xiaofei Xu Zahid Mahmood Sana Noor Haq Jorge Engels", "Joseph Ataman", "Jimmy Hutcheon", "Xiaofei Xu", "Zahid Mahmood", "Sana Noor Haq", "Jorge Engels"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/weather/heat-records-outpace-cool-records-globally-climate/index.html", "title": "Heat records are far outpacing cool records across the globe | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHot-temperature records are far outpacing cool records across the globe this year as Europe and the United States brace again for dangerous heat waves.\n\nIn the US, 92 all-time record high temperatures had been set through July 16, compared with only five all-time record low temperatures, according to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Globally, 188 all-time heat records were broken versus 18 cool records.\n\nStudies have showed that extreme heat will increase in frequency, intensity and duration because of the climate crisis. Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, told CNN that the hot-and-cold record imbalance is a signal of the climate crisis, and scientists have noted a trend in recent years that hot extremes are outpacing cold ones.\n\n“This is what you would expect from a planetary warming that’s been driven in large part from greenhouse gases; this is now the world we’re living in,” Vecchi told CNN, noting that “it’s fair to think that almost every heatwave that we see right now has some influence from global warming.”\n\nAll-time records were poised to topple in the UK on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures running 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than normal for this time of year.\n\nThe UK Met Office on Monday warned highs could approach 40 degrees Celsius (around 104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time – a prediction that prompted meteorologists there last week to issue a “red” heat warning for the first time ever. This forecast would break the record for the UK’s hottest-ever temperature – 38.7 degrees Celsius. The Met Office reported that Wales experienced its all-time hottest day on Monday and Scotland was at risk of seeing its own.\n\nFurther south, where the heat has been entrenched for more than a week, at least 1,000 people have died from heat-related illness in Portugal and Spain so far. Temperatures in Spain climbed to more than 45 degrees Celsius (114 degrees Fahrenheit) during its nearly week-long heat wave.\n\nAnd in the US, more than 40 million people were under heat warnings and advisories on Monday from North Dakota to Texas, where high temperatures were expected to climb into the 90s and 100s. Dozens of temperature records could be broken through the week, forecasters warned.\n\nGlobal scientists last year concluded that with every fraction of a degree of warming, the effects of the climate crisis worsen. While extreme heat events would still occur without climate change, the increasing intensity and frequency of these events in recent decades has been linked to the rise of fossil fuel emissions and observed global warming.\n\nImagine a bell-shaped curve of temperatures, Vecchi said, with cold on the left and warm on the right. As climate change shifts this temperature curve to the warmer side, the long tails of the curve increase by a proportionately larger amount than the middle, signifying the increasing likelihood of hotter events to happen and making cold events less likely.\n\nVecchi said the European heat wave is noteworthy, given its back-to-back nature, which will only continue as the planet warms and is all the more reason to prepare for a hotter future.\n\nWhile this year isn’t yet trending to be the hottest on record, despite the South Asian heat wave back in May and yet another heat dome in Europe, this year remains warmer than historical eras, which Vecchi said “is driven in large part due to the increase in greenhouse gases coming from fossil fuel burning.”\n\n“It’s been a year of warmth,” he said. “And these are the signatures of global warming.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez Angela Fritz", "Rachel Ramirez", "Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/world/heat-wave-rare-alerts-europe-intl/index.html", "title": "Dangerous, extended heat wave threatens millions in Western ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter the second-warmest June on record, western Europe is bracing for its second dangerous heat wave of the summer.\n\nThe UK, Portugal, Spain and France are facing record-breaking temperatures this week, with little relief in sight.\n\nHot conditions will continue to worsen ongoing wildfires in southwestern Europe. Level 3 heat alerts, the highest level possible, are in place for 14 states within Portugal and in eastern Spain through the end of the week.\n\nRecord heat in the United Kingdom\n\nOn Monday, the UK Met Office issued a “rare” Amber Extreme Heat Warning for Sunday, July 17, as hot temperatures look to build later this week for much of England and Wales.\n\n“Heat-health alerts have now been issued to the majority of the country, with temperatures set to remain consistently high throughout the duration of this week,” reported Dr. Agostinho Sousa, head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nThe UK’s record high temperature is 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit), which could be surpassed as soon as this weekend, according to the met office.\n\n“Some models have been producing maximum temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the UK over the coming weekend and beyond,” the met office’s Rebekah Sherwin said.\n\nAs the country prepares, officials are warning about the dangers to vulnerable communities.\n\nFamilies cool off in the River Darent on July 12, 2022 in Eynsford, United Kingdom.

Lisbon and Santarém could see temperatures reaching 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe heat wave is expected to continue until at least the end of the week on the Spanish mainland, Spain’s national weather service said on Monday.\n\nIt’s not just the Iberian Peninsula sweltering in the heat. France will remain hot through the end of the week as well, reaching temperatures in the mid 30s. Heat alerts cover parts of eastern France, including Toulouse and Bordeaux.\n\nThe European region is all too familiar with this. Last month Europe reached record high temperatures and their second-warmest June on record.\n\n“Daily maximum temperatures in Spain, France, and Italy soared above 40 °C and the extreme heat exacerbated the ongoing drought conditions in the Po River basin,” Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said.\n\nMuch of Italy has also been experiencing a summer heat wave. Verona will see highs reaching 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) by Friday.\n\nEleven died on July 3 following an ice avalanche on the Marmolada glacier in the Italian Alps. Italian Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, blamed the collapse on the “deterioration of the environment and the climatic situation.”\n\nThe Italian government last week declared a state of emergency for five northern regions of Italy under extreme drought conditions.\n\n“Most of us can enjoy the hot weather when it arrives, but it is also important to keep yourself hydrated and to find shade where possible when UV rays are strongest, between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” Dr. Sousa said. “If you have vulnerable family, friends and neighbors, make sure they are aware of how they can keep themselves protected from the warm weather.”\n\nThe threat of wildfires\n\nSeveral hydrographic basins in Portugal are currently showing clear signs of the consequences of the ongoing drought. One example is the Aldo Lindoso reservoir, which is currently at only 15.8% of its capacity. European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-2\n\nThirty-five wildfires in Portugal have left 29 people injured so far, the Portuguese Civil Protection department said in a news conference on Saturday.\n\nThe European Commission has mobilized its firefighting fleet to help Portugal, and according to CNN Portugal, more than 80 municipalities in 10 districts are at maximum risk of fire for the next few days.\n\nThe Ourém fire, 80 miles north of Lisbon, Portugal, has torn through nearly 5,000 acres since July 7. It is currently the largest in the region, while hundreds of firefighters are working to contain it.\n\nThe heat will increase the risk for fires with progressing dry conditions. The Portuguese government declared a “state of contingency” to reinforce emergency services ahead of the heat wave. Most of the country has “extreme” to “very extreme” fire danger throughout the week, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.\n\nCoruche, Santarém could see a 48-degree high (118 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday, which would break an all-time record for Portugal, according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere (IPMA).\n\nThe IPMA also said more than 96 percent of the country is experiencing “severe” to “extreme” drought, the highest two levels, which creates a dry environment that can easily spark wildfires.\n\nPortugal’s Critical Fire Period runs from July 1 to September 30. During extreme fire risk, burning recreational bonfires, waste piles, fireworks or fires of any kind is prohibited. Some forest spaces may also be restricted to unauthorized persons.\n\nRelated Story", "authors": ["Payton Major Caitlin Kaiser", "Payton Major", "Caitlin Kaiser"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}]}
