This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/24/mccain-trump-feud-running-list-clashes-snubs-and-conflicts/1089090002/", "title": "The McCain-Trump feud: A running list of clashes, snubs and conflicts", "text": "From the moment Donald Trump announced his presidential ambitions, he and Sen. John McCain had been locked in a highly publicized feud, waged in media interviews, on Twitter, at rallies, and in official statements.\n\nTrump's condemnation of Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and \"criminals\" lit the fuse, with McCain saying he disagreed with the characterization.\n\nThe war of words — over policy and politics — sizzled ever since.\n\nIn politics, the adage \"never speak ill of the dead\" applied also to the dying, including one’s enemies. But that sentiment seemingly disappeared.\n\nWhile McCain may not have deserved the abuse heaped on him, he certainly courted it, throwing as many punches as he took.\n\nHere's a list of the insults, snubs and attacks by the president and his White House directed toward McCain:\n\nJune 30, 2015: Two weeks after Trump announced his presidential candidacy in a speech widely criticized for calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and drug runners, McCain put distance between himself and the celebrity billionaire. \"I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans,\" McCain told The Arizona Republic after he held a town-hall-style event at CAE Aviation Academy Phoenix at Mesa's Falcon Field airport.\n\nJuly 10, 2015: The Republic published a story with the headline \"McCain, Flake want no part of Trump's Phoenix rally.\" Trump campaign sources subsequently confirmed that Trump himself knew about the article, which quoted McCain speaking about Trump's comments about Mexicans on MSNBC. \"I just think that it is offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry, but other citizenry, but he's entitled to say what he wants to say,\" McCain said. \"But I guarantee you the overwhelming majority (in Arizona) ... do not agree with his attitude, that he has displayed, toward our Hispanic citizens. We love them.\"\n\nJuly 11, 2015: Trump appeared at a rally at the Phoenix Convention Center. \"We have incompetent politicians, not only the president,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain.\" The pro-Trump audience booed the mention of McCain's name. After the event, Trump hammered McCain some more. \"I've supported John McCain, but he's very weak on immigration,\" Trump said. \"If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.\"\n\nJuly 16, 2015: The New Yorker published McCain's reaction to Trump's Arizona rally. “This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,” McCain said in the interview. “Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.” Trump immediately fired back on Twitter, demanding that McCain apologize for the \"crazies\" remark and calling McCain a \"dummy\" for graduating last in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy. Trump called for McCain to be defeated in his primary.\n\nJuly 18, 2015: The feud really exploded when Trump, at a Saturday event in Iowa, disparaged McCain's service during the Vietnam War. Trump, who did not serve in Vietnam, said McCain was “a war hero because he was captured” and that he liked “people that weren’t captured.” McCain, a former Navy aviator who was shot down in 1967 and held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, was defended by groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Officers Association of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and Concerned Veterans for America.\n\nAug. 10, 2015: McCain, who had been trying to keep out of a running feud with Trump, criticized Trump over comments about Fox News personality Megyn Kelly, a debate moderator who had clashed with Trump. McCain denounced Trump's comments, which were widely derided as sexist, as offensive. McCain also defended his record on veterans' issues from Trump's attacks. \"He said that I had been a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I've never been on the Veterans' Affairs Committee,\" McCain said. \"He said that I haven't done anything for veterans. The last two major pieces of legislation were done by me, and we handle thousands — literally thousands — over time of veterans cases, of helping them. I'm proud of our record of helping our veterans, and every veterans organization, after what Mr. Trump said, came to my defense.\"\n\nMarch 1, 2016: Trump won big on Super Tuesday, making his march toward the Republican presidential nomination all but unstoppable. Pressure began building on McCain, who had been saying he would support whoever the GOP's standard-bearer was, even Trump. Kirkpatrick's campaign put out a web ad showing McCain saying he'd support Trump while highlighting a range of controversial Trump remarks. McCain was in a difficult political position because he was in the middle of a Republican primary campaign in which he was constantly attacked as too moderate or liberal.\n\nMarch 3, 2016: McCain joined Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, in beating up Trump. McCain focused on foreign policy. At the time, McCain aides pointed out that he'd also taken Trump to task over Trump's attitude toward Muslims, Trump's support for torture, and Trump's approving remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nApril 19, 2016: McCain announced he would not attend the Republican National Convention in July, where Trump would accept the party's nomination.\n\nMay 5, 2016: Politico published audio leaked from a fundraiser in which McCain grimly tells supporters that Trump is hurting the GOP brand with Arizona's Latino electorate and that \"this may be the race of my life.\" But McCain subsequently told reporters he was sticking with Trump. \"Because I'm a proud Republican. I am a Ronald Reagan-Teddy Roosevelt Republican and I support the Republican Party,\" McCain said. \"And the Republicans have chosen the nominee for the party. I think that makes sense.\"\n\nMay 11, 2016: Trump seemed to want to make peace with McCain, telling national radio personality Don Imus: \"You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also, heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don’t get caught, they’re all heroes as far as I’m concerned. And that’s the way it should be.”\n\nAug. 1, 2016: McCain hit Trump over his attack on the parents of U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. However, McCain did not withdraw his support of Trump. \"I'll tell you what: Anytime from now on, when that question is asked, if I change my mind, I'll let you know,\" McCain told reporters. Trump quickly retaliated by saying he would not endorse McCain in his primary, resurrecting his accusation that McCain hadn't done a good job for veterans.\n\nAug. 5, 2016: Trump changed course and read a formal endorsement of McCain. \"I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office,\" Trump said. \"And I fully support and endorse his re-election.\"\n\nOct. 4, 2016: McCain stood up for Trump with regard to comments Trump made about soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder; McCain suggested the media left out the context and distorted Trump's meaning. Trump thanked McCain on Twitter.\n\nOct. 8, 2016: McCain finally pulled his support of Trump after a vulgar 2005 recording of Trump talking about women surfaced, joining many other Republicans in walking out on their party's nominee.\n\nJan. 29, 2017: McCain and fellow Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., issued a statement criticizing Trump's initial executive order on immigration, calling it \"poorly vetted.\"\n\nThe senators said they feared the order \"will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\"\n\nIn response, Trump fired back from his Twitter account, calling the two \"sadly weak.\"\n\nFeb. 9, 2017: After McCain criticized the White House for calling a raid on Yemen a success, noting a U.S. Navy SEAL died during the event, Trump attacked McCain on Twitter. He chided the senator for characterizing the raid as a failure, saying it only emboldens the enemy.\n\nMay 30, 2017: In Australia for talks on security in the Asia-Pacific region, McCain urged Australia to not give up on its alliance with the United States over jitters about Trump. \"I realize that some of President Trump's actions and statements have unsettled America's friends,\" McCain said. \"They have unsettled many Americans as well.\"\n\nThat referred to a testy phone call between the newly installed Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which allegedly ended with Trump hanging up on Turnbull. McCain later helped to smooth over the incident.\n\nJune 12, 2017: While not a fan of former President Barack Obama's foreign policy, McCain said the U.S.' standing abroad was better under the previous administration. His remarks came in the same month that Trump criticized Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of London, on Twitter after terrorists killed eight and wounded dozens others after an attack in that city.\n\n\"What do you think the message is? the message is that America doesn't want to lead,\" McCain said about Trump's statement, according to The Guardian.\n\nJune 30, 2017: After Trump attacked MSNBC morning news personalities Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough on Twitter, McCain tells NBC News, \"I'm just embarrassed. Embarrassed isn't the right word. I just regret it.\"\n\nHe added he wasn't surprised, but disappointed. A survey by The Washington Post found at least three dozen other members of Congress from both parties felt the same way.\n\nJuly 20, 2017: Just hours after announcing he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, McCain blasts Trump for his decision to end an Obama policy of offering CIA training for moderate Syrian rebels fighting the regime of Bashar Al-Assad.\n\n\"If these reports are true, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin,\" McCain said in a statement.\n\nJuly 27, 2017:McCain casts a dramatic \"no\" vote on the \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act, providing the decisive vote that kept the law alive. The late-night vote brought an immediate, somewhat mild, reaction from Trump. But he would soon use numerous opportunities to diss McCain — usually without naming him — by calling out the senator's \"thumbs-down\" gesture that sank the bill.\n\nAug. 15, 2017: McCain defended then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster from critics on the alt-right, a loosely defined group whose far-right ideology includes racism, populism and white nationalism. When asked about it, Trump responded by attacking McCain, not for his McMaster defense, but for his vote against the Affordable Care Act repeal.\n\n\"You mean Senator McCain, who voted against us getting good health care?\" Trump said.\n\nSept. 1, 2017: In a Washington Post guest column, McCain wrote that bipartisan cooperation is more important than ever, given Trump has \"no experience in public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.\"\n\nWhile saying Congress must respect the office of president and its authority, he reminded his fellow lawmakers they are not subordinate to the president and have a role in providing a check on executive actions.\n\nOctober 17, 2017: While accepting the Liberty Medal, McCain denounced \"spurious, half-baked nationalism,\" and warned that approach is leading America to lose its prominence in world leadership.\n\nDuring a radio interview the next day, Trump issued a warning to McCain after the senator had criticized him on foreign policy.\n\n\"I’m being very, very nice but at some point, I fight back and it won’t be pretty,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked about those comments on The View, a TV show co-hosted by his daughter, Meghan, McCain laughed off the warning.\n\nNov. 11, 2017: Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted his country did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections — a statement that Trump accepted. McCain did not, and lashed out at Trump for taking the word of the Russian dictator over the findings of U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nMarch 20, 2018: After Trump congratulated Russian President Putin for winning re-election, McCain lashed out at the comment as un-American. \"An American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said.\n\nMay 3, 2018: In his forthcoming memoir, McCain condemned Trump's leadership style, saying that to the president, \"the appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values.\"\n\nHe also criticized Trump for his harsh assessment of refugees, his characterization as \"fake news\" any accounts he does not agree with and his praise for dictators and autocrats.\n\nMay 5, 2018: The New York Times reported that McCain doesn't want Trump to attend his funeral and would prefer to have Vice President Mike Pence be there. The comments came from associates close to McCain, and were confirmed by multiple news sources.\n\nMay 10, 2018: White House staffer Kelly Sadler joked in a meeting that the administration didn’t need to worry about McCain’s opposition to the nominee for CIA director because he was \"dying anyway.\"\n\nHer leaked remark was in response to McCain's opposition to Gina Haspel. The comment was widely criticized by both those who oppose the president and his backers. Many called for her to fired, including members of the McCain family.\n\nSadler kept her job and the White House refused to apologize for the comment.\n\nIt wasn't until a month later that Sadler was quietly let go.\n\nJune 20, 2018: At a rally in Duluth, Minnesota, Trump again referred to McCain's \"no\" vote on the Affordable Care Act last year, drawing boos from the crowd. The president made the \"thumbs-down\" gesture, but never mentioned McCain by name. In response, Meghan McCain tweeted out her disgust at the reference, noting Trump did it repeatedly and \"it never stops being gross.\"\n\nJuly 18, 2018: During his meeting in Helsinki with Putin, Trump again indicated he accepted Putin's claim that Russia had nothing to do with U.S. election interference in 2016. Trump also said both countries are to blame for their difficult relationship.\n\nIn a statement, McCain shot back, saying of Trump's comments that \"no prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.\"\n\nAug. 13, 2018: At the signing of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, Trump left out any reference to McCain. Fellow lawmakers named the bill after McCain in recognition of his leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee and his years of service in the Senate.\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK contributed to this article.\n\nContact Mary Jo Pitzl at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com and follow her on Twitter @maryjpitzl.

In a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 62% of respondents said Trump is doing more to divide the country, while 31% said he is doing more to unite the country.\n\nTrump's more aggressive performance Tuesday in Arizona came the night came the night after a sober speech about a new military strategy in Afghanistan. Trump on Monday read primarily from a prepared speech that also called for national unity in the wake of clashes in Charlottesville, Va., after a white supremacist rally earlier this month.\n\nYet, just 24 hours later, Trump had returned to the unfiltered, combative approach he relied on during the campaign.\n\nMore:'Vintage Trump': President unloads on enemies at Phoenix rally\n\nCritics said Trump showed a lack of perspective in which he attacked the media and domestic political opponents than of the nation's enemies.\n\n\"Trump doesn't just criticize media more than he criticizes neo-Nazis — he criticizes them more than radical Islamic terrorists,\" tweeted Republican pollster Frank Luntz.\n\nIn another post, Luntz said \"President Trump is talking more about his war with the media than the War in Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn his first political rally since the controversy over his comments about racial violence in Charlottesville, Trump continued to say that both sides were responsible for the violence at the white supremacist rally to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, who had asked Trump to cancel the rally, noted that a young woman in Charlottesville died after a white supremacist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\n\"It wasn't the right time for a campaign rally here in Phoenix,\" Stanton said Wednesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe.\n\nStanton, a Democrat, said Trump's performance \"continued to divide this country.\"\n\nIn Phoenix, Trump claiming the media downplayed his criticisms of white supremacists. \"They don’t want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry, and violence, and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists, and the KKK. I’m really doing this more than anything else — because you know where my heart is — to show you how damn dishonest these people are.”\n\nMore:President Trump condemns white supremacists after Charlottesville violence\n\nThe media did cover Trump's condemnations, which came after an initial statement in which Trump said \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. In the president's own retelling of his past comments, however, Trump omitted his references to \"many sides\" or \"both sides\" being involved in the violence.\n\nWhat's more, in a long and winding press conference at Trump Tower the day after his condemnation of groups such as the KKK and neo-Nazis, Trump said left wing protesters were just as violent as white supremacists — which set off a firestorm of criticism from members of both parties.\n\nMore:Trump's assertion left wing protesters just as violent as white supremacists in Charlottesville sets off firestorm\n\nDuring his hour-long-plus harangue in Phoenix, Trump also:\n\nProtested the movement to remove Confederate-era statues\n\n\"They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history,\"\n\nRaised the specter of a government shutdown\n\nHe suggested he would not sign a budget bill if it did not included money for a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. \"Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.\" During the 2016 campaign, Trump said Mexico will pay for the wall, which Mexican leaders deny.\n\nStrongly suggested he would pardon former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio\n\nArpaio was convicted for contempt of court over his use of anti-migrant patrols along the U.S-Mexican border, Taunting the media by not using the word \"pardon,\" Trump said: \"I'll make a prediction.

Jeff Flake, Trump said, \"nobody wants me to talk about your other senator who is weak on borders, weak on crime.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump pronounced that he was pleased with the rally, and called out one of Arizona's Republican senators by name.\n\n\"Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house,\" Trump tweeted. \"I love the Great State of Arizona.

Trump aggressively pushed back, rejecting the article’s conclusion that he had, on multiple occasions, disparaged those serving in the military, particularly service members who had been wounded or killed.\n\nOne of the claims in the article, which is based on anonymous sources, was about Trump’s private remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee often tangled, including over McCain’s pivotal vote against a bill that would have overturned much of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe article by Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg reads:\n\n\"Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, ‘We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,’ and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. ‘What the f--- are we doing that for? Guy was a f---ing loser,’ the president told aides.\"\n\nAfter the article was published, Trump took to Twitter to reject its reporting, including what he said about McCain.\n\nMore:Trump campaigned in '16 on remaking Michigan manufacturing, Did he deliver?\n\nMore:Fact-checking Joe Biden’s comparison of violent crime and murders data\n\nOver three linked tweets, Trump wrote: \"I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets, but the lowering of our Nations American Flags, and the first class funeral he was given by our Country, had to be approved by me, as President, & I did so without hesitation or complaint. Quite the contrary, I felt it was well deserved. I even sent Air Force One to bring his body, in casket, from Arizona to Washington. It was my honor to do so. Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!\"\n\nHere, we’ll focus on Trump’s assertion that he \"never called (McCain) a loser.\"\n\nThe reality is that Trump did say that about McCain in a widely noted public event in 2015.\n\nThe event in question was a family leadership summit in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Here’s the full video, with the remarks in question coming at about the 5:10 mark.\n\nAfter Trump recalled McCain saying something that Trump considered an insult to him and his supporters, \"I said, 'Somebody should run against McCain,' who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president! I raised a million dollars for him. That's a lot of money! I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But he lost. So I never liked him much after that, because I don't like losers.\"\n\nAmid audience laughter, the moderator, Republican pollster Frank Luntz, then interjected, \"But he's a war hero!\"\n\nTrump responded, \"He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.\"\n\nLater that day, Trump retweeted, with seeming approval, a web post headlined \"Donald Trump: John McCain Is ‘A Loser,’\" that recapped his exchange at the summit.\n\nNeither the White House nor Trump’s campaign responded to an inquiry for this article.\n\nOur ruling: Trump tweeted, \"I never called John (McCain) a loser.\"\n\nThat’s false.

He was fired last June, a day before President Donald Trump signed into law protections for whistleblowers at Veterans Affairs facilities around the country. He is currently appealing the move.\n\nHiggins is organizing an upcoming march in response to Cohen’s remarks and in protest of the hospital’s treatment of veterans.

But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/susie-wiles-donald-trump-2024-campaign/index.html", "title": "Susie Wiles helped Donald Trump win Florida twice. Now she could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSusie Wiles was searching for her next act when Donald Trump came knocking last spring.\n\nPlotting a comeback after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was proving to be tougher than the former President had anticipated, and he needed someone to whip his disorderly political operation into shape. Surrounded by advisers who he suspected had only stuck around to make money, Trump began asking close friends who else could be trusted to take on the unenviable task.\n\n“After all the drama of his first term and the election, everyone was enriching themselves through Trump, and he f**king hates that. It became clear after several people mentioned her name that Susie wouldn’t be like that,” said a person close to Trump.\n\nWiles was an intriguing choice from the start. A veteran of Trump’s presidential campaigns, she had already proved her political worth twice over, helping him notch a win in Florida in 2016 and then growing his margin of victory there in 2020. Still, it was a curious move for the optics-obsessed former President to make his top lieutenant a 64-year-old bird-watching, pound cake-baking grandmother, who asked only that her travel expenses be covered when she accepted the position in March 2021.\n\nBut as Trump readies a widely expected 2024 campaign, people in every corner of his orbit – from ardent election deniers to fixtures of the Republican establishment – say Wiles may be the most sensible choice to helm it. CNN spoke with 16 former and current Trump aides and advisers and people close to Wiles for this story, many of whom described her as the consummate professional – someone who has adeptly navigated Trump world’s “Lord of the Flies” factionalism without making enemies, earning the respect of both his youngest aides at Mar-a-Lago and the domineering personalities in his kitchen cabinet.\n\n“Trump world is dynamic and volatile and innovative and ever-changing, and Susie is the rock,” said Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who has known Wiles for years.\n\n“The people around him, whether they like Susie or not, all agree that she doesn’t stir up trouble,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who is close to both Trump and Wiles.\n\nWiles’ command of Trump’s post-presidential activities – from his midterm travel and 2022 endorsements to fundraising through his various committees – has also landed her praise in Washington, where some Republicans are decidedly less enthusiastic about the prospect of another White House bid by the former President.\n\n“Susie is a supremely talented woman in a male-dominated arena,” said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “Her ability to navigate tough political environments to execute campaign goals and deliver Republican victories is unmatched.”\n\nOf course, there is another theory for Wiles’ meteoric rise through the Trump world ranks. Her complicated history with Ron DeSantis has left some Trump allies with the impression that she could be an asset if Trump finds himself in an unexpectedly competitive 2024 primary against the popular Florida governor.\n\nWiles once served as a top adviser to DeSantis, but she was abruptly ousted from his inner circle in 2019 amid rising tensions between the duo and was then let go from Trump’s campaign operation at the governor’s behest. She was later reinstated.\n\n“I’ve never heard her bash on DeSantis in a ruthless way, but I think she is very aware that he was intimately involved in [her] getting bounced from the 2020 campaign,” said a current Trump adviser.\n\nAt the very least, it was enough to create a lasting fissure in their relationship, which several well-placed sources said is virtually nonexistent nowadays. But some believe Wiles’ familiarity with DeSantis – especially his potential weaknesses as a candidate – could also be useful in the future.\n\n“I don’t think President Trump would have won Florida in 2016 without Susie Wiles, and she was instrumental in Ron DeSantis’ victory [as governor] in 2018. They would both benefit from having Susie involved in a 2024 campaign,” said David Bossie, a longtime Trump friend and adviser.\n\n“No doubt” she would be more loyal to Trump in a primary, said Caputo. “She is as steadfast as they come, and I think the President understands that in Susie Wiles, he has competency and loyalty in levels that are very beneficial to him.”\n\nA Trump spokesman and Wiles separately declined to provide comment for this story.\n\nA longtime fixture in Trump world\n\nTo be widely respected in Trump’s orbit is no small feat. Before Wiles became the former President’s de facto chief of staff, four men held the title in some capacity during his presidency. One was fired via Twitter, two have become high-profile critics of their former boss and the last one may be in serious legal jeopardy amid revelations by the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nWiles would never introduce herself as Trump’s chief of staff, preferring to think of herself as a trusted adviser, but nearly everyone in his inner circle sees her as such, including his adult children, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\n“She’s probably his longest-serving adviser now. Anytime I’ve gone [to see Trump], she’s either there or she’s just left,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Florida-based lobbyist who served as ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration.\n\nNot a golfer herself, Wiles spends most of her time with Trump huddling in offices at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club or Mar-a-Lago resort. People who speak to Trump regularly said he will often pause phone conversations to loop in Wiles, that alone being a supreme testament to her value. Last week, Wiles was seated to the right of Trump during a meeting at Bedminster with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, according to a photo posted by Orban’s spokesman.\n\n“‘It’s always, ‘Let me get Susie in here’ or ‘Make sure you tell Susie about that,’” said Caputo.\n\nBut if she needs to get something to Trump without delay, she has been known to make an appearance on the green as well. “She’ll jump in a cart herself and drive down to Trump if she needs to get something in front of him,” said one of the Trump advisers.\n\nUnlike Trump’s previous gatekeepers, Wiles doesn’t closely monitor whom he speaks with, according to several people familiar with the matter. Nor does she actively try to prevent contact with figures on the fringe, these people said. That includes a rotating cast of characters who indulge Trump’s obsession with the 2020 election or periodically introduce him to far-fledged conspiracy theories of their own. Wiles’ own view of whether the election was stolen is less clear-cut than her boss’, according to multiple people familiar with her thinking.\n\n“I don’t think she believes the election was stolen,” said a person close to Wiles. “She thinks we got beat by … not doing a good enough job of stopping states in the regulatory aspects of the election and that Democrats were smart and ruthless in using the Covid-19 pandemic to their advantage.”\n\nWiles “carefully rides the tent,” said Caputo. “She has to interact with people who think [the election was stolen], and people who don’t.” Several Trump advisers who were directly involved in organizing the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6 or who assisted in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election have drawn intense scrutiny from the House select committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol. Wiles has not been asked to testify before the panel, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, nor has she been subpoenaed to testify in other ongoing inquiries related to election interference.\n\nSome of those allies are on weekly calls that Wiles holds with Trump’s political team, when she and his coterie of paid advisers discuss primaries on the horizon and how Trump-backed candidates are faring. More recently, she has been involved in conversations about how Trump can best position himself for a third presidential campaign. Wiles “touches everything,” as one Trump adviser described her role.\n\nOver time, these calls have endeared Wiles to the rest of Trump’s team. She will take time to praise aides and advisers by name for contributing savvy ideas and ensures everyone stays up-to-date on Trump’s upcoming travel, said people familiar with the calls. But she will also confront failures head on.\n\n“Susie is so sweet that everybody wants to please her – and maybe that’s part of her shrewdness – but when she has to discipline the motley crew that is Trump world, she doesn’t think twice about it,” said one of the people close to Trump.\n\nAbove all, it is Wiles’ competency and the former President’s belief that she isn’t profiting off him that set her apart, according to some of the longest-lasting faces inside Trump’s circle.\n\nAs one Democratic strategist in Florida put it: “If I was running for president, I would want Susie Wiles.”\n\nMaking her mark in GOP politics\n\nWiles has built a reputation for delivering hard truths to powerful men. Some of the most difficult words she’s had to share were with her father, the late sportscaster Pat Summerall, during a 1992 intervention to confront his alcoholism.\n\n“Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name,” Wiles said in a letter that was read during the intervention, according to Summerall’s 2006 autobiography. The words made his knees buckle, Summerall wrote. Only after hearing from Wiles did the former NFL kicker and legendary broadcaster agree to enter the Betty Ford Center for treatment.\n\nBy then, Wiles had already kick-started a successful path into politics. It wasn’t campus activism, Ronald Reagan, or a seminal moment that drew her in. The hypercompetitive political arena had simply felt like a natural fit for Wiles, who had grown up with two brothers in addition to being the only daughter of a professional athlete. In 1979, she was hired as an assistant for US Rep. Jack Kemp, an ex-teammate of Summerall’s on the New York Giants. Next, she jumped aboard Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign as a scheduler.\n\nAfter a few years in the Reagan administration, Wiles launched a consulting career in her native northeast Florida. She soon became a power player in Duval County, along with her then-husband Lanny Wiles, who was also active in Florida Republican politics (the two later divorced in 2017). There, she ran the district office for US Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican, before advising successive Jacksonville mayors, while raising two daughters.\n\n“I have rarely met someone with her instincts for politics and policy and where they intersect,” said John Delaney, the first of those mayors, who leaned on Wiles to sell voters on a multibillion-dollar tax increase to modernize the city. “She knows what to magnify that will resonate with the public.”\n\nAfter two decades in and around Jacksonville City Hall, Wiles in 2010 was asked to meet with a former health care executive named Rick Scott. A political novice and awkward public speaker, Scott had launched an eleventh-hour, self-funded GOP bid for Florida governor against state Attorney General Bill McCollum, a heavy favorite with support from most Republicans.\n\n“We told her, ‘Hey, we got a guy nobody knows, we’re behind by 50 points, come join us,’” said Curt Anderson, a top strategist on the Scott campaign. “She was able to immediately come in and bring a level of organization that kept people on task.”\n\nWith her candidate’s fortune at her disposal, Wiles engineered an upset over McCollum and the GOP establishment. Scott then managed a narrow victory in the general election. (He is now the state’s junior US senator.)\n\nAnderson recalled that before they pulled off Scott’s 2010 win, Republican operatives had warned Wiles and the campaign’s other advisers, “You’ll regret this, and you’ll never work in politics again.” So when Wiles later linked up with Trump – joining a campaign that her peers considered doomed – she was entering familiar territory.\n\nThe two first met during a Trump Tower rendezvous arranged by Wiles’ then-boss, lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard. At the time, most of Florida’s political class had sided with native sons Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primary. Wiles, herself, didn’t come across as a Trump-type. She had helmed the fleeting 2012 presidential campaign of Jon Huntsman, whose high-road approach to politics was antithetical to Trump, and then helped Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in Florida that year.\n\nTim Miller, who advised Huntsman’s campaign, said it was “bizarre” to watch Wiles align with Trump.\n\n“We were running a campaign on modernizing the Republican Party, and running on climate change and being decent to immigrants,” said Miller, a vocal critic of the GOP’s embrace of Trump. “You can’t think of a campaign further from the Donald Trump campaign than the Huntsman campaign.”\n\nBut Wiles felt the party needed a jolt from the outside. The two clicked, though Trump at first was unconvinced his campaign needed a full-time person in Florida.\n\nThat changed after Trump secured the nomination. Dissatisfied with his top Florida strategist Karen Giorno, Trump was convinced by advisers in September 2016 to consider adding Wiles to his campaign instead.\n\n“Susie was brought in to run battleground communications for us in a new role as the campaign was expanding,” said Bossie, who was then serving as his deputy campaign manager.\n\nAt first, Wiles was not a good fit with Trump’s style. “He likes someone who can command a room and fit the role he sees in his mind, and here’s this gray-haired matronly figure,” a source told CNN. “She’s not the one who is plucked out of central casting.”\n\nThe tension erupted in the final weeks of the race after a fundraiser at his Doral golf course, when Trump, convinced he was going to lose Florida and blaming his campaign team on the ground, unloaded on Wiles during a late-night meeting, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident. Wiles wondered if she should quit, one source said, and he considered letting her go just 10 days before the election.\n\n“In her words, it was a way she had never been spoken to in her life,” said a person close to both Wiles and Trump.\n\nBut Trump’s eventual victory in Florida earned Wiles a reputation as a talented fixer and Sunshine State savant. So in 2018, when Trump’s hand-picked choice for Florida governor – DeSantis, then a former congressman – was struggling in the campaign home stretch, Wiles was once again asked to take charge. With her in command, DeSantis eked out a 32,000-vote victory, the closest election for governor in state history.\n\nNot long after, the problems started.\n\nA public fallout\n\nDeSantis entered office a relative stranger to Tallahassee and the insular world of Florida state government. To guide his transition, he tapped Wiles, who also ran his political operation, and Gaetz, a former state lawmaker before he was elected to Congress and whose father had reigned as a powerful state Senate president. Together, Wiles and Gaetz built DeSantis an administration, interviewing potential department heads from her home in Ponte Vedra Beach, where they killed time watching birds in the estuary off her backyard, Gaetz said.\n\nDeSantis jumped out to a fast start, gaining national attention for his governing style while raising money at an impressive clip. But behind the scenes, a gulf emerged between him and Wiles. A person close to DeSantis said the governor’s wife, Casey, an influential voice in his orbit, privately questioned whether Wiles was more loyal to Ballard’s lobbying clients, and the couple grew skeptical of the allegiances of people she had hired. They purged staffers they viewed as too close to Wiles and marginalized her role in his political operation.\n\nThen came a revelation, outlined in internal memos published by the Tampa Bay Times in September 2019, that DeSantis’ political committee had planned to sell access to the governor to donors, including $100,000 to privately golf with him or $250,000 for an intimate gathering. Wiles had authored one of the memos, which made clear DeSantis and his wife approved the fundraising plan. DeSantis placed the blame on Wiles and cut her out of his circle, though he never explained to her why, a source said.\n\nTrump then removed Wiles from his reelection team at DeSantis’ urging, multiple sources confirmed. She stepped away from Ballard Partners, citing health issues.\n\nIn a matter of days, the most successful political operative in Florida was out of work.\n\n“It was tough for her both personally and professionally,” Delaney said.\n\nCaputo, the Trump adviser, called it a “terrible mistake” by DeSantis to let Wiles go. A source who worked for the governor remarked in 2019 to a reporter now with CNN: “How do you kick Susie Wiles out of your inner circle if you want to become President of the US?\n\nWiles remained on the sidelines until the summer of 2020, when Trump saw polling that suggested he was in trouble of losing Florida to Joe Biden. Several people lobbied for Trump to bring back Wiles, and he began floating the idea in conversations. Bossie tried to get DeSantis onboard, but the governor loudly argued against her rehiring. Meanwhile, Ike Perlmutter, the billionaire Republican donor who owns a home near Mar-a-Lago, sided with DeSantis and strongly pushed Trump to reconsider multiple times, sources familiar with those conversations told CNN. But Trump had made up his mind.\n\n“Trump basically said Susie running his 2020 Florida operation was the right answer. He first asked, ‘What do you think if we do this?’ and then the conversation went to Trump basically saying, ‘We are doing this,’” recalled a source familiar with Trump and Perlmutter’s conversations.\n\nA spokesman for the DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s relationship with Wiles. Several Florida political insiders declined to speak to CNN about the DeSantis-Wiles saga on the record, citing concerns that they or their clients could face retribution from the governor.\n\nWiles’ return to Florida was a “game-changer,” said one source familiar with operations there. Trump gave her tremendous latitude to run his Florida operation, including resources to target voters who were not traditionally Republican, such as Latinos, school choice parents in the Black community and Jewish residents in Democratic strongholds. In Florida, Democrats traditionally had an advantage during early voting on Sundays, when Black churches organized “Souls to the Polls” voter drives. Trump’s Florida team started “Believers and Ballots” to get White Christians from church to early voting sites and saw strong returns.\n\nOne GOP operative in Florida said, “We were the only state that got exactly what we asked for from Trump. And that was all [Wiles].”\n\nIn the end, while Trump narrowly lost most swing states, he won Florida by a healthy 4-point margin.\n\n“She’s like the political Muhammad Ali,” said state Sen. Joe Gruters, chairman of the Florida GOP. “That’s why the President trusts her and works with her on the basis that he has already and probably will in the future.”\n\nA ‘difficult campaign’ ahead\n\nWith Trump and DeSantis potentially headed for a 2024 collision, some Republicans close to both men believe Wiles could be an X factor for Trump. She knows better than most DeSantis’ strengths and where his vulnerabilities lie, and she has developed a deep loyalty to Trump, people close to her say.\n\nWiles also has a record of unexpected victories she will want to preserve if she accepts a senior role in another Trump campaign, which could be markedly difficult due to his age, mounting legal troubles, and an emerging push by prominent Republican leaders for a crowded GOP primary. Justice Department officials are currently investigating Trump’s actions leading up to January 6 as part of its criminal probe of efforts to subvert the 2020 election outcome, while there’s a separate investigation in Georgia into possible criminal meddling in the state’s election results by the former President.\n\n“This will probably be one of her final acts in the political world,” said one of Trump’s advisers.\n\n“It’s going to be a difficult campaign no matter what anybody says,” added Caputo. “[Trump] will need 25 Susie Wiles.”\n\nWhile some Trump allies fear DeSantis could become another roadblock to the former President’s quest for a second term, Wiles, in her conversations with people inside Trump’s orbit, has downplayed the role she could play. She is known to say, “You run your race” – a mantra for focusing on your own campaign and not the other team – and is dismissive when asked by allies about the status of her relationship with the Florida governor.\n\n“I’m sure she knows some things that Ron wouldn’t want to have to deal with, but she is smart and knows her credibility is on the line, so she won’t go out there peddling rumor and innuendo,” said one of the people close to Wiles.\n\nStill, Wiles and DeSantis are not on speaking terms. DeSantis will attempt to win reelection this fall without Wiles on his team, though few expect him to need her.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, however, Wiles is seen as indispensable. Even in the cutthroat environment Trump has cultivated around him, where unanimity is rare, his closest aides and advisers regard Wiles as a steady hand in one of the most tumultuous periods of his political career.\n\n“Out of all the people who have led his political operation, she has by far done the best job, and I don’t know that it’s particularly close in a lot of ways,” said one of the current Trump advisers.\n\nIt would seem, then, that Wiles would be an obvious choice to run Trump’s next campaign should he choose to pursue that path. But the most predictable thing about Trump is that he loves to be unpredictable.\n\n“Would I predict that she would run it? Yes,” said a source close to Trump. “Would it shock me if she got fired tomorrow? No. That’s just Trump world.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Steve Contorno", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/30/state-union-read-excerpts-president-trumps-address/1080784001/", "title": "State of the Union: Full text of Trump's first address", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nHere is the full text of President Trump's first official State of the Union address on Jan. 30, 2018, as prepared for delivery:\n\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n\nLess than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People -- and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\n\nEach day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans.\n\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine.\n\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\n\nWe saw the volunteers of the \"Cajun Navy,\" racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.\n\nWe saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\n\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee.\n\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.\n\nTo everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else -- we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.\n\nSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.\n\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.\n\nOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\n\nSo let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.\n\nAnd together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\n\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\n\nUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\n\nSmall business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.\n\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\n\nOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.\n\nTo lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\n\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half.\n\nThis April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.\n\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone.\n\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.\n\nSmall businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\n\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing -- a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\n\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Please join me in congratulating Corey.\n\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\n\nThis is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\n\nSo to every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.\n\nTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.\n\nWe all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.\n\nTogether, we are rediscovering the American way.\n\nIn America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is \"in God we trust.\"\n\nAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\n\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done.\n\nYoung patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\n\nAmericans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.\n\nFor the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.\n\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.\n\nWe are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.\n\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve -- and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.\n\nI will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\n\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect -- and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers -- and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\n\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.\n\nWe have ended the war on American Energy -- and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.\n\nIn Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's autoworkers -- so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.\n\nMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing -- for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back.\n\nExciting progress is happening every day.\n\nTo speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.\n\nWe also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.\n\nPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure -- I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the \"right to try.\"\n\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.\n\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation's wealth.\n\nThe era of economic surrender is over.\n\nFrom now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.\n\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.\n\nAnd we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\n\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\n\nAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year -- is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\n\nI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\n\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.\n\nEvery Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.\n\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process -- getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.\n\nTogether, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\n\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.\n\nWe can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\n\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.\n\nAs America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\n\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\n\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\n\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school.\n\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.\n\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.\n\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\n\nSo tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.\n\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez -- he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.\n\nCJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.\n\nIn recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise -- one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\n\nHere are the four pillars of our plan:\n\nThe first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.\n\nThe second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it finally ends the dangerous practice of \"catch and release.\"\n\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\n\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\n\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.\n\nIt is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\n\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\n\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\n\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\n\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.\n\nIn 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\n\nMy Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult -- but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\n\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.\n\nWe see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\n\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \"You will do it -- because you can.\" He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\n\nRyan and Rebecca: You embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and congratulations.\n\nAs we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\n\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.\n\nFor this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.\n\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.\n\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\n\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.\n\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.\n\nKenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin's selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \"V\" for \"Valor.\" Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you.\n\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.\n\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\n\nSo today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay.\n\nI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa'ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists -- wherever we chase them down.\n\nOur warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.\n\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.\n\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America's friends.\n\nAs we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\n\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\n\nI am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\n\nMy Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\n\nWe are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.\n\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.\n\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.\n\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\n\nOtto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve.\n\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\n\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved to be free.\n\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.\n\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth.\n\nToday he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\n\nSeong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\n\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world.\n\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\n\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.\n\nMonuments to Washington and Jefferson -- to Lincoln and King.\n\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga -- to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.\n\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people.\n\nA people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us -- defending hope, pride, and the American way.\n\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.\n\nBut above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\n\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\n\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again.\n\nAs long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\n\nAs long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.\n\nOur families will thrive.\n\nOur people will prosper.\n\nAnd our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\n\nThank you, and God bless America.\n\nState of the Union:Trump heralds a 'new American moment'\n\nRelated:Hundreds of protesters targeted Trump as he arrived for State of the Union\n\nMore:Trump signs order to keep Guantanamo Bay detention center open\n\nA new, new American moment?:Ex-Obama aides say Trump lifted phrase from Hillary Clinton\n\nMore:Otto Warmbier's parents attend State of the Union", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}]}

It was the first of 19 days of strikes planned to coincide with the peak holiday shopping season, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nThe strikes are due to take place through early December, and follow walkouts in August and September. Parts of Royal Mail’s service will be out of action for several days at a time as different teams walk out.\n\nThe Communication Workers Union, representing the workers, said in a Tuesday press release that the walkouts were part of the “biggest ongoing strike of the year.”\n\nThe CWU said it is fighting Royal Mail’s plans to change terms and conditions including the introduction of new performance standards and an increase in hours for new staff. The union also said the company had imposed a 2% pay increase on workers, well below the rate of inflation. It is pushing for more, though it has not said by how much.\n\n“Postal workers are facing the biggest assault on their pay, jobs, terms and conditions in the history of Royal Mail,” Dave Ward, the CWU’s general secretary said in a radio interview Thursday that the union posted on Twitter.\n\nRoyal Mail has said that most letters will not be delivered on strike days, and customers should expect delays to parcel deliveries. It would deliver as many tracked parcels and those tagged for fast-track delivery as possible on strike days, the company added.\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson told CNN Business on Thursday that the strike action was “weakening [its] financial position.”\n\n“We are doing all we can to minimize any delays and keep people, businesses and the country connected,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe strikes are the latest in a wave of industrial action in the United Kingdom this year. Rail staff, bus drivers and lawyers are among the groups of workers who have walked out to demand higher pay as soaring inflation savages living standards.

Prime Minister Liz Truss’ plans to push through billions worth of unfunded tax cuts sent the value of the pound plunging and the yields on government bonds soaring.\n\nThat’s already pushing up mortgage payments as lenders price in more aggressive rate hikes by the Bank of England to tackle the inflationary impact of the tax cuts and weaker pound.\n\nIt’s not just UK workers that are fed up.\n\nIn France, striking workers have blockaded ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies fuel refineries for several weeks in a dispute over pay, disrupting supply to thousands of gas stations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the French government took the extraordinary measure of ordering some staff at an ExxonMobil refinery in Normandy back to work. The rarely used measure can be imposed by the government when the country’s national security is deemed to be at risk, and it could be more widely deployed in the dispute if agreement isn’t reached soon.\n\nIn the United States, too, the threat of a rail strike that could further disrupt struggling supply chains has reemerged. Earlier this week, a union of railroad track maintenance workers rejected a tentative agreement with freight carriers over a lack of paid sick leave.\n\nA rail strike by more than 50,000 railroad workers was narrowly averted in September after unions and employers came to a tentative deal on pay.\n\n— Hanna Ziady, Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich contrbuted reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/08/24/ups-fedex-usps-amazon-text-scam/70669131007/", "title": "Text scam impersonating UPS, FedEx, Amazon and USPS involves ...", "text": "You may or may not have been expecting a package, but still got text message, email or call with a tracking number, or were told that a package was either delayed or undeliverable.\n\nThese unexpected communications are all part of a larger scam, the Federal Communications Commission warns, and have only grown as more people have shifted to shopping online since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission reported that the \"fake package delivery problems\" text message scam was one of the top-reported text message scams of 2022. Scammers send these texts to impersonate the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, or UPS, and attach a link to a website may look legitimate, but is not.\n\nPeople who opened the link reported they were told to pay a small “redelivery fee,” which was just a trick to get the person's credit card number, and sometimes personal information, like their Social Security numbers.

But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Starbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021) 02:06 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is “building contingency plans.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/22/fedex-delivery-notifications-scam-texts/4548088002/", "title": "FedEx text scam: Be careful not to fall for delivery notifications", "text": "FedEx is warning consumers not to fall for a new scam that tries to trick them into opening a text or an email about the status of a delivery.\n\nPeople across the country are receiving texts and emails that appear to be from FedEx alerting them to a package.

Fridge No More launched in October 2020, followed by competitors Jokr, Gorillas, and Buyk, which came in September 2021. A month later, Philadelphia-based GoPuff entered the city, followed by Istanbul-based Getir in December. Their fight for consumers brought rich discounts and splashy marketing, but the long-term potential of the business model remains unclear.\n\nFridge No More CEO Pavel Danivol told employees in an email Thursday that a deal with a potential buyer fell through two days earlier and that it could not continue operating.\n\n“This decision was sudden and unforeseeable,” Danivol wrote in the email, a copy of which was viewed by CNN Business.\n\n“Due to the dramatic and unexpected lack of funding and failure to close the sale of Fridge No More,” the email continues, “this letter shall serve as notice to you that there will be a mass layoff.”\n\nThough the buyer was not named in the email, a source familiar with the deal talks told CNN Business that DoorDash, the publicly-traded delivery company, had discussed acquiring select assets of Fridge No More, such as its real estate and products, in recent weeks and had been providing an undisclosed amount of bridge financing – a type of funding startups sometimes use to continue operations in between formal funding rounds – as it assessed a deal.\n\nDoorDash, which recently launched its own ultra-fast delivery service in New York City, ultimately walked away over a number of factors, the person said.\n\nThe New York Post earlier reported Fridge No More’s layoffs and its talks with DoorDash.\n\nBuyk, which touted 15-minute grocery deliveries in New York City and Chicago with no minimum order or fees, confirmed to CNN Business that its 870 employees were laid off on Friday. The news comes days after the New York Post reported the startup had furloughed the vast majority of its employees, as well as its CEO, due to challenges over Russia sanctions. Buyk’s Russian founders had been providing bridge financing until the company closed its next financing round, a spokesperson for the company told CNN Business.\n\n“However, the restrictions [Russian President] Putin has imposed in response to US sanctions have made this bridge financing setup untenable, despite neither of our founders being sanctioned,” the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nWhile ties to Russia may have complicated matters, the sudden failure of the two startups due to inability to secure capital quickly underscores a more fundamental issue with their businesses. “The worst business model ever created was rapid grocery delivery,” said Brittain Ladd, a food supply chain consultant who said he has advised a number of companies in the space and formerly worked in strategy at Amazon.\n\nLadd said that some of the startups lack a path to profitability and are reliant on venture capital funding, calling it “the only reason [they’re] able to exist.”\n\n“It is too similar to Kozmo.com,” said Ladd, of the infamous dot-com era delivery startup that raised hundreds of millions in capital on a similar premise before going bust.\n\nEssence Wilson, who worked as a part-time courier for Fridge No More in New York City, told CNN Business that she’d sometimes have to ride her company-owned scooter many blocks from the company’s mini-warehouse to deliver a box of Raisin Bran cereal, or a single apple. Wilson said she didn’t see the company thriving in the long-term, but she didn’t think the end would come quite so soon.\n\n“I feel like they were so eager to customer please they ended up, kind of, doing themselves in,” she said.\n\nWorkers were notified in a Telegram chat group with more than 800 members that they could retrieve any personal belongings from their stores on Friday. According to a screenshot viewed by CNN Business, the workers were also told they could take any products from produce, dairy, cheese and meat, or its bakery.\n\n(In December, another competitor in the space operating in New York City folded: 1520.)\n\nWilson told CNN Business she would consider joining another ultra-fast delivery startup though she specified she likely wouldn’t apply for courier roles, citing the physical toll of the job.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Grubhub, the food ordering and delivery platform, touted a new partnership with Buyk. Now, it’s distancing itself: “Given their news, the project is on hold until further notice,” said a Grubhub spokesperson in a statement to CNN Business.\n\nOther established companies have also looked to partner with emerging ultra-fast delivery firms. Uber, for example, announced a partnership in May with GoPuff, the privately-held startup promising deliveries in 30 minutes or less that is valued at $15 billion. In February, Uber announced a venture with FastAF, a startup offering premium goods like Apple AirPods and Olaplex hair products in 25-minutes or less.\n\nWhile Uber helped to popularize the model of treating drivers and couriers as independent contractors, many of the ultra-fast delivery startups employ their couriers, which allows for more control over their schedules but also affords workers certain benefits and protections.\n\nIn its email to employees concerning the layoffs, Fridge No More provided a phone number to reach the company’s cofounders with any questions. When CNN Business called the number, there was an automated voice message: “Due to the current circumstance, if you’re calling for the unemployment [employer identification number], the number is….” (Callers can also leave a voicemail.)\n\nFridge No More did not respond to CNN Business’ request for comment.\n\nWhen attempting to place an order on Buyk Friday morning, the app read: “Hey everyone! Our services are temporarily unavailable. Check back soon!” Meanwhile, doing the same on Fridge No More simply returned: “Sorry we’re temporarily closed until further notice.”", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/business/uk-postal-strike-job-cuts/index.html", "title": "Royal Mail warns of 6,000 job cuts as postal workers step up strikes ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nUK postal service Royal Mail (ROYMY) said Friday that it could cut 6,000 jobs as it warned of a big loss this year, which it blamed on a wave of strikes and a decline in its parcel delivery business.\n\nAs many as 115,000 Royal Mail staff went on strike on Thursday to demand better pay and working conditions. It was the first of 19 days of strikes planned to coincide with the peak holiday shopping season, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nThe strikes are due to take place through early December, and follow walkouts in August and September. Parts of Royal Mail’s service will be out of action for several days at a time as different teams walk out.\n\nRoyal Mail said it expected to report an operating loss of between £350 million and £450 million ($506 million) this year, taking into account eight days of strikes already taken or formally notified to the company.\n\nA further 16 days of strikes could take place in November and December.\n\n“If these take place, the loss for the full year would increase materially and may necessitate further operational restructuring and headcount reduction,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe Communication Workers Union, representing the workers, said in a Tuesday press release that the walkouts were part of the “biggest ongoing strike of the year.”\n\nThe CWU said it is fighting Royal Mail’s plans to change terms and conditions including the introduction of new performance standards and an increase in hours for new staff. The union also said the company had imposed a 2% pay increase on workers, well below the rate of inflation. It is pushing for more, though it has not said by how much.\n\nIn a statement posted to its website on Friday, the union said it was demanding a government inquiry into the “gross mismanagement” of Royal Mail.\n\nRoyal Mail has said that most letters will not be delivered on strike days, and customers should expect delays to parcel deliveries.

Now port congestion and delays are back and could be around for a while.\n\nCovid lockdowns in China have wreaked havoc at Shanghai, the world’s biggest container port, and are now causing problems at other major ports around the world.\n\nSome Chinese cities, including Shanghai, have started easing Covid restrictions in recent days, but experts say that the damage has already been done, and global shipping will suffer well into the summer. That could exert even more pressure on global supply chains already reeling from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and keep inflation running hot.\n\nData from Project44, which tracks global supply chains, showed that shipment delays between China and major US and European ports have quadrupled since late March, when China shut down the city of Shanghai, which has the world’s busiest container port.\n\nA Cosco Shipping container ship is seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Shanghai, China April 24, 2022. Str/Reuters\n\nBy the end of April, ships from China to Seattle were taking four days longer than expected to arrive, up from about one day the previous month.\n\nThe time it takes ships to leave China and arrive at major ports around the world increased steadily over the past year, but there had been some signs of relief since December with transit times between Shanghai and Long Beach, for example, dropping in January and February.\n\nSince March, however, there’s been a sharp increase again in transit times on that route.\n\nTo add to the problem, many truck drivers have struggled to reach ports in China to pick up containers because of travel restrictions and Covid testing requirements. Shipping giant Maersk warned in an advisory last month that trucking services in Shanghai would be “severely” impacted by these restrictions.\n\n“With the manufacturing industry being shuttered [in Shanghai] and truckers unable to travel quickly, exports have been reduced, and shipment delays have increased,” said Josh Brazil, director of Supply Chain Data Insights at Project44.\n\nDelays will “continue into the summer months,” as factories struggle to return to normal operations in Shanghai, he added.\n\nAlthough authorities have allowed some businesses to restart production, many workers are still stuck in quarantine at home. Factories that do reopen are facing component shortages and difficulty in securing trucks to carry goods into or out of the port.\n\n“The ripples in shipment delays are only beginning to become visible and are expected to extend well into the next few months,” said Brazil.\n\nShanghai — China’s leading financial center and most populous city — has been under a strict lockdown since late March. More than 8 million residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The Covid restrictions have spread to other cities, including Beijing — the nation’s capital.\n\nShanghai port remained open throughout the lockdown, but data from various shipping firms show an increasing backlog of ships and containers.\n\nUS supply chain companies have expressed concerns about fresh chaos heading towards American ports, which are still recovering from the severe congestion and delays they suffered last year.\n\nShelley Simpson, chief commercial officer for JB Hunt Transport Services, said late last month that while there has been “a temporary relief” at US ports, things may get a lot “a lot worse” this summer because of what’s happening in China.\n\nIt “just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again,” she added.\n\nShips and containers jam the ports\n\nShipping queues are getting worse in China — and other parts of the world.\n\nNearly 20% of container vessels globally are currently waiting outside congested ports, according to a survey published last Thursday by Windward, an Israel-based global maritime data firm.\n\nAlmost a quarter of those unberthed ships are stuck outside Chinese ports. That’s 412 ships, up 58% since February, the survey added.\n\nIt’s clear that lockdowns in China have caused a bottleneck, the firm said.\n\nAcross China, at least 27 cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to latest CNN calculation on Wednesday. Beijing effectively shut down its largest district this week.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping signaled this week that China would continue with its zero tolerance approach to Covid. On Thursday, Xi told all levels of government to “resolutely adhere to the zero-Covid policy.”\n\nChina is home to seven of the world’s top ten container ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In Shanghai — the epicenter of China’s current Covid outbreak, the situation remains severe.\n\nThe number of vessels waiting at the Port of Shanghai had increased to 384 by April 25, up 27% from a month earlier, according to most recent data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPressure is also building on other Chinese ports, as vessels try to find alternative ports to berth. Ships have faced growing delays since late March outside Ningbo-Zhoushan port, the world’s third largest port, less than a hundred miles from Shanghai, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence.\n\nContainers are also piling up because of truck shortages.\n\nTrucks wait to load containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nAt the peak of the lockdown in Shanghai, containers were sitting for as many as 15 days at the port before being picked up by truckers, up from fewer than 5 days when the restrictions first took effect, Project 44 data showed. The average wait time has since come down but was still 10 days last Wednesday.\n\nZhang Wei, vice mayor of Shanghai, acknowledged last week that the city is seeing “reduced efficiency” in cargo transport and “poor logistics” since the lockdown.\n\nManufacturing and trade take a hit\n\nThe turmoil at the ports has already hit China’s factories and foreign trade, as manufacturers have to wait longer to get raw materials.\n\nIt is also harder for them to ship their products to customers. Inventories of finished goods have surged to the highest level in about a decade, as products pile up in warehouses due to weak demand and the difficulty of finding trucks to move them.\n\nCranes lift containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nLatest PMI surveys — released on Saturday — showed that factory activity slumped to the worst level since February 2020, when China was battling the initial Covid outbreak. New export orders that manufacturers received in April fell at a much faster pace than in March.\n\nThe decline in export orders showed that the chaos at some major ports, including Shanghai, have hit China’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\n\n“Worryingly, there was plenty of evidence of worsening supply pressures, with supplier delivery times collapsing, input prices surging and inventories of finished good rising to their highest since June 2012,” wrote Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, in a report.\n\n“Such supply pressures will have ramifications across supply chains globally, as already evidenced in some recent US Q1 earnings reports in the tech sector,” he added.\n\nGlobal inflation to go higher\n\nThe situation in Shanghai will push global inflation higher this year, said Daejin Lee, associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHe pointed out that last year’s inflation was driven by two factors — supply shortages of key parts owing to supply chain bottlenecks, and record high container freight rates.\n\nBoth problems continue this year, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fueled global inflation by driving up prices for energy and other key commodities.\n\n“Another lengthy delay” in seaborne supply of key parts because of China’s port congestion could increase consumer prices “much faster than previously expected,” Lee said.\n\nMaersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created “bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.”\n\nThe company’s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2018/02/19/los-angeles-moscow-new-york-top-list-worlds-most-gridlocked-cities/352194002/", "title": "Los Angeles, Moscow, New York top list of world's most gridlocked ...", "text": "Jon LeSage\n\nOilprice.com\n\nIf you’re thinking about the most traffic-congested cities in the world, images from Beijing and Mumbai may pop up — streets jammed with buses, trucks, and passenger cars.\n\nWhile these cities have been symbolic of rapid growth in crowded cities within China and India, they didn’t even make the top 10. In a new study, Los Angeles topped the list as the most traffic-congested city in the world. Four other U.S. cities made the list, as did London and Paris.\n\nThe INRIX 2017 Traffic Scorecard is based on analysis of the total cost to average drivers in wasted time and fuel cost and through indirect costs affecting businesses in the metro area via increased costs passed on to consumers through higher prices.\n\nRank/city/country Hours spent in congestion % of drive time in congestion 1.

Elon Musk's vision of the Hyperloop system is still years away from taking people from San Francisco to LA in less than an hour.\n\nAs for countries, Thailand leads with the highest average hours spent in peak congestion (56 hours), surpassing Indonesia (51 hours), Columbia (49 hours), and Venezuela (42), with the U.S. and Russia both at 41 hours.\n\nThe U.S. has five cities on the list of the World’s Top 10 Most Congested: Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Miami.\n\nMore:The 10 most popular cities for people who want to work from home in 2018\n\nThe study found that traffic congestion cost U.S. drivers nearly $305 billion last year, coming out to an average of $1,445 per driver. That cost would go up with rising fuel costs, with some oil analysts predicting increases in WTI per barrel prices in the months ahead.\n\nAmericans are unlikely to support the development of high-speed rail systems common in Europe and Asia, and riding scooters and bicycles is unlikely to become as commonplace as it is in countries like the Netherlands and Vietnam. The U.S. is expected to see its traffic gridlock crisis resolved through other transportation modes. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Lyft, Maven, Zipcar, Car2Go, Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, and Tesla are expected to make connected, autonomous, and electrified vehicles collaborate with the best mobility services in U.S. cities.\n\nUber closed its lawsuit initiated by Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving vehicle unit over potential intellectual property theft that plagued the ride-hailing giant over the past year. Waymo initially demanded $1 billion during settlement talks last year, but it was rejected by Uber board members. Uber also ousted founder CEO Travis Kalanick and brought in former Expedia chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi. Like Kalanick, Khosrowshahi rejected Waymo’s second offer to settle for $500 million. He was able to talk Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin into accepting the closing deal: 0.34% of Uber’s $72 billion valuation, which comes in at about $245 million.\n\n\"To be clear, while we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo's proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our lidar and software represents just our good work,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement.\n\nAs Uber emerges from its Waymo lawsuit and begins cleaning up other parts of the mess that blew up last year, it could be competing with Lyft as a leader in autonomous on-demand mobility services.\n\nThat will probably come through smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles — many being hybrids and plug-ins. Uber and Lyft drivers tend to use small vehicles with strong fuel economy to keep the work more profitable. Both companies are participating in partnership test projects that will scope out the potential of automated ride-hailing services.\n\nAlong with carrying passengers, companies like Amazon are exploring the business potential of providing “last-mile logistics” that will provide short-range local delivery of food, small packages, and larger items like consumer appliances. Integrated, shared fleets could be a viable option in the near-term future, according to a Navigant Research study.\n\nThe biggest challenge large companies face is congestion and finding parking spots in mega-cities. Interest is growing in deployment of fleets with automated vehicles, ranging from drones and single-person vehicles to autonomous minibuses. Food delivery and small parcel drop-offs will have the most likely demand, but there are several other delivery services in urban markets that would be ideal for last-mile logistics.\n\nCities such as London and Paris have worked hard at reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. Like other European metro areas, their roads were built centuries ago and were better suited for horses and carriages than for the large numbers of vehicles clogging their streets. London has enacted fines for violating limits placed on road access in some of its busiest sections. The city found that the congestion-charge scheme helps reduce traffic significantly.\n\nOilprice.com is a USA TODAY content partner offering energy industry news and commentary.

In a Chinese readout of the meeting, Xi described his country’s system of governance as “Chinese-style democracy,” in an apparent signal to US allies that ideological differences are not a barrier to relations with Beijing.\n\nStabilizing relations\n\nThe most anticipated in-person diplomacy by Xi on Tuesday was perhaps his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, partly because ties between Beijing and Canberra have frayed significantly over the past years.\n\nIn a statement, Albanese called the meeting an “important step towards the stabilization of the Australia-China relationship.”\n\nAt the meeting, Xi told Albanese that good relations between Beijing and Canberra were in the “fundamental interests of both our peoples” and “conducive to peaceful development in the Asia-Pacific region.”\n\n“Mr. Prime Minister – you have said on multiple occasions that you will handle our countries’ bilateral relations in a more balanced approach, for which I highly value,” Xi told Albanese.\n\nThe two countries have been locked in a bruising trade dispute and diplomatic freeze since early 2020, when China slapped tariffs on Australia following its call for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nGeopolitics is also a sore point between the two nations. Canberra is alarmed by Beijing’s growing influence in the Pacific islands, while China is angered by Australia’s new military alliance with the US and the UK, intended to provide Australia with nuclear powered submarines and other advance weaponry.\n\nLeaders of the two countries last met when Albanese’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, had brief informal discussions with Xi at the G20 in Japan in 2019. But it has been six years since leaders from the two sides have held a formal bilateral meeting, after then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s sit-down with Xi at the G20 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in 2016.\n\n“We are always going to be better off when we talk to each other, calmly and directly,” Albanese said in his statement. “We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest.”\n\nAs the case with the meeting between Xi and Biden, few in Australia believe the meeting between Xi and Albanese can completely reset the two countries’ strained relations.\n\n“Much has happened in the last six years when the leaders of the two countries last met and the geopolitical dynamics of the region have changed too much for a ‘reset,’” said Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\n“Furthermore, a certain and influential segment of Australia’s foreign policy and national security institutions have fundamentally reshaped how China is viewed and that is difficult to undo,” Hsu added.\n\nJohn Lee, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington and former national security adviser to the Australian government, said core Chinese objectives – such as its South China Sea, Taiwan and South Pacific policies – are “fundamentally at odds with Australia’s core interests.”\n\n“It may be a diplomatic reset of some sorts but not one in substance where both sides begin to genuinely approach each other in good faith and a preparedness to compromise,” Lee added.\n\nBusy schedule\n\nIn a sign of Xi’s busy schedule, the Chinese leader and French President Emmanuel Macron squeezed in a meeting early on Tuesday, before both leaders showed up at the opening of the G20 summit.\n\nThe talks, which lasted for 43 minutes according to the French Presidency, saw Xi reiterate his support for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Xi stressed China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent, advocating a ceasefire, a stop to war and peace talks,” a readout of the bilat from Chinese state media CCTV said.\n\nA readout from the French Presidency said the two leaders “reaffirmed their firm position on preventing the use of nuclear weapons” in the war in Ukraine – a line that was not included in the Chinese readout.\n\nFrance, like other European countries, has hardened its position on China in recent years, increasingly viewing the country as a competitor and security concern.\n\nXi also met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Senegalese President Macky Sall, and is expected to meet a few more world leaders later on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Protests erupt in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping!

In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent.

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

The rule also restricts the ability of “US persons” — including American citizens or green card holders — to provide support for the “development or production” of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China.\n\n“The US moves are a major threat to China’s technological ambitions,” said Mark Williams and Zichun Huang, analysts at Capital Economics, in a recent research report. The analysts pointed out that the global semiconductor industry is “almost entirely” dependent on the United States and countries aligned with it for chip design, the tools that make them, and fabrication.\n\n“Without these,” the analysts said, “Chinese firms will lose access not only to advanced chips, but to technology and inputs that might over time have allowed domestic chipmakers to climb the ladder and compete at the cutting edge.” They added: “The US has chopped the rungs away.”\n\nChips are vital for everything from smartphones and self-driving cars to advanced computing and weapons manufacturing. US officials have talked about the move as a measure to protect national security interests. It also comes as the United States is looking to bolster its domestic chip manufacturing abilities with heavy investments, after chip shortages earlier in the pandemic highlighted the country’s dependance on imports from abroad.\n\nArthur Dong, a teaching professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, described the recent US sanctions as “unprecedented in modern times.”\n\nPreviously, the US government has banned sales of certain tech products to specific Chinese companies, such as Huawei. It has also required some major US chip-making firms to halt their shipments to China. But the latest move is much more expansive and significant. It not only bars the export to China of advanced chips made anywhere in the world using US technology, but also blocks the export of the tools used to make them.\n\nUS President Joe Biden meets with China's President Xi Jinping during a virtual summit from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, November 15, 2021. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWith its Made in China 2025 road map, Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G wireless, and quantum computing. At the Communist Party Congress earlier this month, where he secured a historic third term, Xi highlighted that the nation will prioritize tech and innovation and grow its talent pool to develop homegrown technologies.\n\n“China will look to join the ranks of the world’s most innovative countries by 2035, with great self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” Xi said in the party congress report, released on October 16.\n\nDong said the latest US sanctions will make it harder for China to advance in AI as well as 5G, given the role advanced chips play in both industries.\n\n“In any circumstances,” Williams from Capital Economics said, “China would find achieving global tech leadership hard to achieve.”\n\nMass resignation of US executives?\n\nOne dramatic, and potentially disruptive aspect of the rules is the ban on American citizens and legal residents working with Chinese chip firms.\n\nDane Chamorro, a partner at Control Risks, a global risk consultancy based in London, said such measures are usually “only enacted against ‘rogue regimes’” such as Iran and North Korea. The decision to use this against China is “unprecedented,” Chamorro said.\n\nMany executives working for Chinese firms may now have to choose between keeping their jobs or acting as lawful US residents. “You can’t do both,” Chamorro said.\n\nThe ban could lead to a mass resignation of top executives and core research staff working at Chinese chip firms, which will hit the industry hard, Dong from Georgetown University said.\n\nSo far it’s not clear exactly how many American workers there are in China’s domestic chip industry. But an examination of company filings indicates that more than a dozen chip firms have senior executives holding US citizenship or green cards. At Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment China (AMEC), one of the country’s largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers, at least seven executives, including founder and chairman Gerald Yin, hold US citizenship, the latest company documents show.\n\nA woman inspects the quality of a chip at a manufacturer of IC encapsulation in Nantong in east China's Jiangsu province Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. Xu Congjun/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nOther examples include Shu Qingming and Cheng Taiyi, who currently serve as vice chairman and deputy general manager, respectively, at GigaDevice Semiconductor, an advanced memory chip firm. The Financial Times report said in a recent report that Yangtze Memory Technologies has already asked American employees in core tech positions to leave, citing anonymous sources. But it’s unclear how many.\n\nAMEC, GigaDevice Semiconductor, and Yangtze Memory Technologies didn’t respond to requests for comments.\n\nIf these senior executives depart, “this will create a leadership and technological void within China’s chipmaking industry,” Dong said, as the country loses executives with years of chipmaking experience in an industry with “one of the most complex manufacturing processes known to mankind.”\n\nBeginning of a tech war?\n\nWhile much of the world’s chip manufacturing is centered in East Asia, China is reliant on foreign chips, especially for advanced processor and memory chips and related equipment.\n\nIt is the world’s largest importer of semiconductors, and has spent more money buying them than oil. In 2021, China bought a record $414 billion worth of chips, or more than 16% of the value of its total imports, according to government statistics.\n\nBut some Western suppliers have already started preparing to halt sales to China in response to the US export curbs.\n\nASM International (ASMIY), the Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier, said Wednesday that it expected the export restrictions will affect more than 40% of its sales in China. The country accounted for 16% of ASML’s equipment sales in the first nine months of this year.\n\nLam Researc (LRCX)h, which supplies semiconductor equipment and services, also flagged last week that it could lose between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in annual revenue in 2023 as a result of the US export curbs.\n\nThe party congress, which recently wrapped up, has slowed China’s response to latest US export controls, analysts said. But as Beijing starts assessing the significance of the measures, it might retaliate. Xi is “concerned” about US plans to bolster domestic chip production as his administration moves to restrict China’s ability to make them, said US President Joe Biden in a speech on Thursday.\n\n“This conflict is just beginning,” said Chamorro.\n\nChamorro said the most valuable “card” in China’s hand might be the supply of processed rare earth minerals, which Beijing could embargo. Rare earth minerals are important materials in electric vehicle production, battery making and renewable energy systems.\n\n“These are not easily or quickly replaced and China dominates the processing and supply chain,” Chamorro said.\n\nThe Biden administration, meanwhile, is also weighing further restrictions on other technology exports to China, a senior US Commerce Department official said Thursday, according to the New York Times.\n\nIf either country takes these steps, it could shift the tech arms race between the United States and China to a whole new level.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/politics/nuclear-fusion-energy-us-scientists-climate/index.html", "title": "US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time ever, US scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe US Department of Energy is expected to officially announce the breakthrough Tuesday.\n\nThe result of the experiment would be a massive step in a decadeslong quest to unleash an infinite source of clean energy that could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will make an announcement Tuesday on a “major scientific breakthrough,” the department announced Sunday. The breakthrough was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nNuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat. Unlike nuclear fission that powers electricity all over the world, it doesn’t generate long-lived radioactive waste.\n\nScientists across the globe have been inching toward the breakthrough, using different methods to try to achieve the same goal.\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain a hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second.\n\nThe energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat, and that heat holds the key to producing energy.\n\n“They contain the fusion reaction by bombarding the outside with lasers,” Tony Roulstone, a fusion expert from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, told CNN. “They heat up the outside; that creates a shockwave.”\n\nEven though getting a net energy gain from nuclear fusion is a big deal, it’s happening on a much smaller scale than what’s needed to power electric grids and heat buildings.\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nIn the UK, scientists are working with a huge donut-shaped machine outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result.\n\nAfter a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak, giant magnets are activated to create a plasma. The plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. This forces the particles from the fuel to fuse into one. With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms. The missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy.\n\nNeutrons, which are able to escape the plasma, then hit a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and their kinetic energy transfers as heat. This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.\n\nLast year, scientists working near Oxford were able to generate a record-breaking amount of sustained energy. Even so, it only lasted 5 seconds.\n\nWhether it’s using magnets or shooting pellets with lasers, the result is ultimately the same: Heat sustained by the process of fusing the atoms together holds the key to helping produce energy.\n\nNIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe.\n\nChittenden and Roulstone told CNN that scientists around the globe now must work toward dramatically scaling up their fusion projects, and also bring the cost down. Getting it commercially viable will take years of more research.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” Chittenden said. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nHowever, Chittenden called this new chapter in nuclear fusion “a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting.”\n\nRoulstone said there’s much shows more work needs to happen to make fusion able to generate electricity on a commercial scale.\n\n“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said. “Therefore, we can say (it) is a success of the science but a long way from providing useful energy.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/china/china-xi-diplomatic-victory-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's Xi attempts to claim diplomatic victory in battle for global ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nBali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nXi Jinping may have rejected US President Joe Biden’s description of the 21st century as a battle between democracies and autocracies, but as the G20 and APEC summits showed, the Chinese leader remains intent on pushing back at American influence overseas.\n\nStill basking in the afterglow of a Communist Party Congress that last month saw him consolidate and extend his grip on power at home, the strongman leader emerged from China’s zero-Covid isolation with a flurry of in-person meetings in Bali and Bangkok last week.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping attends the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia on Wednesday. Willy Kurniawan/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nIn contrast to his self-cultivated image as an ideological hardliner, Xi attempted to portray himself as a broad-minded statesman, telling Biden in their meeting last Monday that leaders “should think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThis sweeping diplomatic outreach appeared specifically targeted at US allies and regional leaders caught in an intensifying rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Since taking office, Biden has shored up relations with allies and partners to counter China’s growing influence.\n\n“Asia Pacific is no one’s backyard and should not become an area for big power contest,” Xi said Friday at the opening of the APEC summit, in the absence of Biden, who had already flown back to the US.\n\nThe whirlwind of face-to-face diplomacy represents something of a victory for Xi, whose self-imposed international isolation had proved extremely costly as China’s relations plummeted with the West and many of its neighbors during the pandemic. Tensions have flared over the origins of the coronavirus, trade, territorial claims, Beijing’s human rights record and its close partnership with Russia despite the devastating war in Ukraine.\n\n“Judging from the sheer volume of international heads of states wanting to have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, I think it’s safe to say that (the trip) has been successful on Xi’s part,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program.\n\nWith broad smiles and handshakes, the Chinese leader held exchanges with his counterparts from the US, Australia, France, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, among others – including leaders whose governments had openly criticized Beijing.\n\nAnd in multiple speeches, Xi, who earlier this year had joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in proclaiming plans to create a “new world order,” attempted to now present himself as a leader for international unity. In a thinly veiled dig at the US, he decried “ideological division,” “block politics,” “cold war mentality,” and attempts to “politicize and weaponize economic and trade relations.”\n\nOver the two summits, Xi held a total of 20 bilateral meetings in a schedule so packed it sometimes stretched late into the night. He also made a point of holding most of the meetings in his hotel.\n\nThe optics speak for themselves.\n\n“All the leaders were lining up patiently to meet the ‘emperor’ of China,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nBut despite the apparent outreach, Xi also showed he was ready to confront perceived slights.\n\nIn a rare, candid moment caught on camera, Xi chided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him of leaking details of a brief conversation between them. As they parted ways, Xi could be heard off camera describing Trudeau as “very naive.”\n\n“It reminded the whole world that there are limits to this smiling diplomacy – as soon as you cross upon China’s interest you can get into trouble,” Cabestan said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's Xi confronts Canadian prime minister in hot mic moment 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nXi’s goal\n\nFor Xi, the diplomatic flurry with Western leaders is a crucial first step toward normalizing relations – which had been severely strained by his assertive foreign policy and the “wolf-warrior” diplomacy of Chinese diplomats.\n\nDespite its often aggressive stance, Beijing is increasingly worried about economic decoupling with the West. The poor state of the Chinese economy – thanks to unrelenting zero-Covid lockdowns and the recent US ban on the export of advanced semiconductor chips to China – have added to Beijing’s urgency to reverse the trend.\n\nNotably, among the leaders Xi met in Bali was Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, home to semiconductor giant ASML – which is under increasing pressure from the US to stop selling its products to China.\n\nDuring their meeting, Xi urged Rutte to avoid “decoupling” and the “politicization of economic and trade issues,” and invited him to visit Beijing next year.\n\n“While Biden may be trying to build a so-called values based alignment against China, Xi is trying to find ways to weaken the cohesion of that alignment by pursuing top-level diplomacy one on one with those countries,” said Sung, the political scientist.\n\nXi’s numerous meetings with US allies are all the more remarkable given recent tensions with Beijing over trade, geopolitics and China’s human rights crackdown on Xinjiang and Hong Kong. In other multilateral settings, such as the Group of Seven summit, Western nations had issued strongly worded statements expressing concerns about China’s human rights record and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Amidst all that, Xi has proven that China still has enough lure and stature to attract all these countries to find ways to work with China. So in that sense, it’s successful diplomacy on Xi’s part,” Sung said.\n\nDomestic message\n\nThe international posturing is also intended for the Chinese domestic audience.\n\nFor Xi, the key message he wanted to send home was already set at the start of the trip, when he met Biden face-to-face for the first time as national leaders.\n\n“The fact that Xi was talking with Biden in a one-on-one setting, with confidence and smiles throughout, generates this image that the era of ‘G2’ has arrived,” Sung said.\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has touted the “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation – his vision of restoring China to its past glory and reclaiming its rightful place as a world leader. In recent years, he has also pushed the notion that the East is rising, and the West is in decline.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden describes what he discussed with Xi Jinping in G20 meeting 03:43 - Source: CNN\n\nTo Xi’s domestic audience, the image of a superpower “G2” – China and the United States – served as a vivid visual representation of both narratives. “China now can talk with the US like a true equal,” Sung said.\n\nBut Chinese people who followed glowing state media coverage of Xi’s trip would have also noticed a striking image: their top leader attending indoor gatherings and mingling with world leaders without a face mask.\n\nThat was a far cry from Xi’s caution for Covid during his first trip abroad since the pandemic. When he visited Central Asia in September, Xi wore a mask to disembark from his plane and skipped a mask-free group dinner where leaders ate and talked around the table.\n\nThis time around, Xi appeared much more comfortable being maskless. He also attended the Group of 20 dinner, where he shook hands and chatted with leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBack home in China, however, snap lockdowns and mass testing edicts continue to torment residents, despite the government’s recent announcement of limited easing of its zero-Covid policy.\n\nIn the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, residents revolted against a Covid lockdown, tearing down barriers and marching down streets. In the central city of Zhengzhou, the death of a 4-month-old girl in hotel quarantine stoked nationwide outcry – the second death of a child under Covid restrictions this month.\n\nHaving had a taste of what living with Covid could look like in Bali and Bangkok, Xi returned Saturday to a China under siege from rising infections and tightening restrictions in many cities.\n\nApart from the Dutch Prime Minister, Xi also invited US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s newly elected Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to visit Beijing early next year.\n\nWhether they will visit a China free of Covid restrictions – and potential travel quarantines – remains to be seen.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/china-us-trade-issues-g20-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What's at stake for the world's top two economies as Biden and Xi meet", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, there were expectations on both sides of the Pacific that he would back away from the trade war his predecessor started with China nearly three years earlier.\n\nFrustrated by China’s huge trade surplus and accusing it of stealing US intellectual property, former President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods in June 2018. Beijing countered with its own tariffs, and the spiral continued until a so-called truce was agreed in 2020.\n\nInstead of rolling back those measures, Biden has quietly intensified the trade conflict. In October, his administration imposed sweeping new curbs designed to curtail China’s access to technology critical to its growing military power.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of rising competition, and amid fears of a global recession, the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies will meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia on Monday.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in Bali, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the meeting was intended to stabilize the relationship and expressed hopes that it would lay the groundwork for bilateral economic engagement.\n\nThe stakes are high for both sides, as well as the rest of the world. China, with its nearly $18 trillion economy, has in recent years been the main driver of global growth. But Covid lockdowns and a real estate crisis have slammed the brakes on its expansion this year.\n\nWhile expectations for the meeting are low, it’s crucial for the two sides to re-engage, Mattie Bekink, the Shanghai-based China director of the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network, told CNN Business.\n\nFor decades, regular lines of communications existed between US officials and their Chinese counterparts, but most of those avenues were cut off after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in July.\n\n“It’s important for heads of state to speak directly,” she said. “There is a lack of trust in this relationship. If Xi and Biden send the signal that it’s time to resume communications, hopefully this will trickle down to the lower levels.”\n\nBesides trade, it was important for the two sides to work together on topics such as climate change and food security, she said.\n\nNot backing off\n\nStabilizing a US-China economic relationship that sits at such a low ebb will be tough given dashed expectations on both sides, according to Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Asia Security Initiative, who publishes a newsletter on US-China business and economic relations called Trade War.\n\n“First of all, it was a big deal that Biden didn’t try to find some way to reduce the $300 billion in Trump-implemented tariffs, which many expected him to do,” he told CNN Business. “Much to the shock and distress of Beijing, Biden has made things even more uncomfortable on the trade side.”\n\nBiden’s measures included: October’s limit on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment, a ban on all goods produced in China’s Xinjiang region, blacklisting some Chinese companies, and sanctioning dozens of Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s crackdown of the special administrative region.\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration levied a series of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods such as solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. China responded by slapping tariffs of its own on iconic American products like Harley-Davidson and Jack Daniel’s.\n\nThe US-imposed taxes and subsequent trade war helped to slow China’s economy, but they also cut into American companies’ bottom lines, resulting in job cuts, higher prices, and hits to household budgets, as economic analysis would later show.\n\nIn the “truce” of early 2020, Trump signed a “phase one” trade agreement with China under which Beijing promised to purchase $200 billion more in American exports than in 2017. China, however, did not follow through and “bought none of the additional $200 billion of US exports committed under the deal,” according to a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nWhen Biden came into office, he kept the Trump tariffs in place in part because China still hadn’t met those goals, despite pressure from American businesses that argued for rollbacks. However, as inflation started to climb to historic highs, US officials including Yellen have had discussions with China to potentially lift some tariffs to help tame price hikes.\n\nTech curbs\n\nBekink said she did not expect any dramatic shifts in trade flows to emerge as a result of the Biden-Xi meeting. And the surplus in China’s favor hasn’t gone away.\n\nIn the first ten months of this year, China’s exports to the United States rose 6.6% to $495 billion, compared to the same period in 2021, according to the latest Chinese customs data. China’s imports of American goods rose just 0.3% in the same period to $145 billion.\n\nThe two leaders are, however, expected to discuss the Biden administration’s efforts to ramp up domestic production of semiconductor chips, which he noted last month has already raised concerns for his Chinese counterpart.\n\n“I’ve heard from Xi Jinping that he’s a little concerned about that,” Biden said at an event in Syracuse, New York, where he touted a $100 billion local investment in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe pandemic shone a spotlight on the downside of America’s decades-old dependence on foreign chip production. Lockdowns and factory closures in Asia, followed by a global surge in demand for microchips, led to a crippling shortage of the crucial semiconductors needed for American industries ranging from auto manufacturers to cybersecurity to medical equipment.\n\nThe ensuing production pauses at auto plants contributed to the skyrocketing price of new and used cars, fueling the inflation that remains at the highest level since the 1980s.\n\nThe United States has called the chip shortage a “national security” issue, and in August President Biden signed into law the $200 billion CHIPS and Science Act, a five-year plan to boost domestic chip manufacturing, lower costs, and reduce dependency on the global supply chain.\n\nUS imports of semiconductors from China are 26% lower than before the imposition of 25% tariffs, according to Peterson. The newest restrictions in October have further escalated the growing tech arms race.\n\n“The bigger question is on the future of the tech rivalry,” said Bekink. “I don’t think the US will back down from its strong stance on containing China’s tech prowess. The trade war was always a tech rivalry.”\n\n— Lucy Bayly and Alicia Wallace contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Juliana Liu"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/middleeast/china-xi-jinping-mbs-saudi-arabia-intl/index.html", "title": "China's Xi gets a grand welcome to Saudi Arabia and promises a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping with a lavish reception in the capital Riyadh on Thursday, as the two countries head for a number of summits heralding an “epoch-making milestone” in China’s relations with the Arab world.\n\nSaudi state TV showed a grand ceremony laid out for the Chinese leader, as bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler known as MBS, received him at Al-Yamamah Palace.

They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}]}

Disney and ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” hits theaters this weekend, and with it comes the type of anticipation and box office expectations that Hollywood has not seen in months.\n\nThe Marvel film not only has to follow 2018’s “Black Panther,” one of the biggest blockbusters ever, but has the challenge of doing so without star Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020. If all of that wasn’t enough, it arrives as theaters, and Disney, the company releasing the movie, really need a hit.\n\nIf early projections and ticket sales are any indication, it appears “Wakanda Forever” will be just that.\n\nThe film, which stars Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett as the grieving princess and queen of the Vibranium-powered African country of Wakanda, will likely have a record-breaking debut of around $180 million this weekend, and possibly even $200 million.\n\nDisney, more conservatively, is projecting around $175 million, which still would be one of the biggest openings of the year.\n\nIf “Wakanda Forever” clears $158 million this weekend, which is likely, it would become the biggest November opening ever. And if it makes $200 million that would be one of the highest-grossing debuts of all time.\n\nThe film is off to a strong start, bringing in $28 million on Thursday night. That’s good news for a theater industry in need of a blockbuster.\n\nWhy “Wakanda Forever” matters to theaters\n\n\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" is set to be one of the biggest films of the year. Marvel Studios\n\nWhen “Black Panther” hit theaters in February 2018, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. The Marvel superhero flick opened to a eye-popping $202 million weekend before going on to make $1.3 billion worldwide and garnering multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.\n\n“There is precedent for this franchise to draw massive crowds,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “Every blockbuster counts more than ever for movie theaters right now.”\n\nWhy does it matter how “Wakanda Forever” does this weekend? Because after a strong showing this summer, the domestic box office has hit a wall because of a lack of new, notable films.\n\nThere have been a few surprise hits in recent weeks — Paramount’s “Smile,” Universal’s “Ticket to Paradise” and Sony’s “The Woman King” — but overall the North America box office is down 34% compared to pre-pandemic 2019. That’s a lot of ground to make up and not much time left to do it.\n\nThere are myriad reasons why ticket sales are tracking behind pre-pandemic levels, but one major factor is that widely distributed film releases are down 38% compared to the same time in 2019.\n\n“Coming out of this slow period with a massive blockbuster like ‘Wakanda’ is welcome news for theater owners, especially as there aren’t any more apparent gaps on the release calendar in the near future,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business.\n\nTheaters need “Wakanda Forever” right now for the same reason they needed “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and “The Batman” earlier this year. It’s unlikely that the box office makes up the deficit from 2019, but if “Wakanda Forever” fires up the ticket booth this weekend then that could cut down the difference and lead to strong momentum heading into 2023.\n\nFilms like “Wakanda Forever” not only help bring in ticket sales, they pull in audiences who may have forgotten what it was like to go to the movies. That benefits not just Marvel’s bottom line, but the entire ecosystem of the film industry, including theaters.\n\nWhy “Wakanda Forever” matters to Disney\n\n\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" could break records this weekend. That's good news for Disney and theaters. Marvel Studios\n\nAnd then there’s Disney (DIS).\n\nThe media giant has had a rough 2022. Its stock is down 42% so far this year and this week was particularly bad.\n\nThe company’s shares sank 13% on Wednesday after the company reported its streaming business lost $1.4 billion last quarter, despite growing its subscriber base beyond expectations.\n\nThe performance of “Wakanda Forever” likely won’t move the needle on Disney’s stock, given that investors remain heavily focused on the company’s streaming endeavors. But a strong showing from the film could help change the conversation.\n\nA big opening weekend could also act as a bridge to another potential blockbuster for Disney next month: “Avatar: The Way of Water.” James Cameron’s long-awaited sequel to the highest-grossing film of all time opens December 16, and like “Wakanda Forever” could be a lucrative sequel to a beloved film.\n\n“Momentum is everything in this business,” Dergarabedian said. “Movie theaters have been waiting for a film like ‘Wakanda Forever’ to remind people of the wonder and majesty of a great film on the big screen.”\n\nThat, according to Dergarabedian, could “ignite a spark” that might set off a “chain of movie-going to carry forward to the end of the year and into 2023.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/media/top-gun-maverick-box-office/index.html", "title": "'Top Gun: Maverick' is unlike any blockbuster Hollywood has seen in ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThere are summer blockbusters, and then there’s “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\nThe Paramount film, featuring Tom Cruise’s return to the skies as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell decades after the hit 1986 original, won the domestic box office over the Labor Day weekend — bringing in $7.9 million for the four-day holiday.\n\nThat makes “Maverick” the only film in history to take the top spot on Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend.\n\nIt’s just one of the film’s notable financial achievements. It crossed the $700 million mark in ticket sales, passing Marvel’s “Black Panther” to become the fifth highest-grossing film in North American history, and has made $1.4 billion worldwide since opening in May.\n\nIn another sign of “Maverick” staying power, the movie boasts a box office multiple of roughly 5.5, which means its current domestic haul is 5.5 times that of its opening weekend total. That’s unheard of in contemporary Hollywood, as most big films have a multiple of around 2.5.\n\nBut “Maverick” fans kept coming back to theaters throughout the summer, so much so that the film made at least one million dollars a day for 75 straight days.\n\nThat type of financial longevity not only speaks to the film’s quality — it garnered a 96% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes — but serves as an old-school success story at a time when theaters really needed one.\n\n“There are not enough adjectives to describe the importance of the box office performance of ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ to the industry, having come at a time when naysayers remained skeptical of the ability of the movie theater to draw audiences,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “Truly a watershed event.”\n\nHollywood simply does not produce summer blockbusters like this anymore.\n\nWhile several recent movies have done quite well, like 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” and 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” such releases are typically “front-loaded,” meaning they open to huge numbers on debut weekend then sputter out in the following week.\n\nA film that refuses to land\n\nDergarabedian isn’t exaggerating when he expresses how important “Maverick” has been to theater owners and Hollywood this summer: The film accounted for 13% of the overall domestic box office this year.\n\nAnd that doesn’t capture its symbolic value. “Maverick” comes at an inflection point for theaters, which are trying to return to normalcy after being devastated by the pandemic. Streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ have also taken a stronger hold on consumers by featuring the type of big-budget productions that used to be exclusive to theaters.\n\n“Maverick,” however, demanded the biggest screens possible, and in doing so, reminded millions of viewers what it’s like to go to the movies after months — if not years — of staying away.\n\nTom Cruise and Paramount “went all in on the moviegoing experience,” Dergarabedian said. “That bet paid off big and, in the process, solidified Cruise’s position as perhaps the last true movie star while simultaneously proving that there is no substitute for the movie theater experience.”\n\nStill, the summer box office has been desolate the last few weeks, with films either being held up by production issues in Hollywood or heading directly to streaming. It’ll be a few months until two potential blockbuster sequels hit theaters, with “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” coming in November and “Avatar: The Way of Water” due in December.\n\nCan either of those films fly as high? Time will tell.

It also makes “Multiverse of Madness,” which stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the superhero sorcerer, the 11th biggest opening in domestic box office history.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, the film’s debut more than doubled the opening weekend of the original “Doctor Strange,” which notched an $85 million weekend in 2016. “Multiverse of Madness” easily stands as the biggest opening of 2022 so far.\n\nThe film, which has Doctor Strange battling evil forces across parallel universes, has already made $450 million worldwide.\n\nA Marvel movie doing well at the box office is not a surprise. The franchise has garnered more than $25 billion in ticket sales since 2008 and holds multiple box office records. However, this news is great for a theater industry that is still trying to reach a level of normalcy after the pandemic decimated business.\n\nThanks to hits like March’s “The Batman” and April’s “Sonic The Hedgehog 2,” the box office has bounced back this year, but it still has a long way to go in order to reach pre-pandemic heights.

For starters, this was the first film in the franchise that wasn’t directed by Steven Spielberg, and it wasn’t based on a Michael Crichton best seller, either.\n\nThe film, in which Grant returns to the dinosaur island to save a lost boy, also received bad reviews notching a 48% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nEven so, it still managed to come in at No. 7 at the North America box office that year.\n\n4. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\n\n\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\" may have had the worst review score of the series, but was still a hit. Universal Pictures/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nYear: 2018\n\nBox office haul: $417.9 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $420.2 million\n\n“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” may have the lowest review score of the entire series (47% on Rotten Tomatoes), but that didn’t stop audiences from lining up. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 2018.\n\nIt had the benefit of coming after 2015’s “Jurassic World,” one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. Also, it starred Chris Pratt, who was arguably hitting his zenith as a movie star in both the Jurassic World and Marvel franchises in the same year.\n\n“Fallen Kingdom,” in which Pratt and co-star Bryce Dallas Howard save dinosaurs from an active volcano, is the second film in the series to make over $1 billion worldwide.\n\n3.

The film, the franchise’s first sequel, brought back Jeff Goldblum’s Dr. Ian Malcolm, and was simply everywhere from Burger King to comic books. It even had its own cereal, “Jurassic Park Crunch,” whose cereal shapes were meant to resemble dinosaur footprints.\n\nBut the film was a letdown with critics, garnering lackluster reviews and it failed live up to the original “Jurassic Park.” Still, it was a huge hit, opening to $72 million in North America — a record at the time.\n\n2. Jurassic World\n\n\"Jurassic World\" rebooted the franchise to massive success at the box office. Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment via AP\n\nYear: 2015\n\nBox office haul: $654.1 million\n\nAdjusted for inflation: $710.7 million\n\n“Jurassic World” may have had the hardest task of all the films in the series: rebooting the franchise for a new generation of fans. It pulled it off.\n\nThe film, which imagined what Jurassic Park would look like if the theme park was operational, had a potent mixture for blockbuster success. Pratt, its star, was coming off the very popular Marvel film “Guardians of the Galaxy” and audiences were ready to embrace the nostalgia from the original film.\n\nThe film opened to a then-record $208 million in North America before going on to be the seventh highest-grossing film of all time with a $1.6 billion box office haul.\n\n1.

But “Jurassic Park” is far more than CGI dinosaurs tearing up a theme park and terrifying the humans there.

Cruise is reprising his role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, the cocky fighter pilot who felt the need for speed 36 years ago.\n\nThe Paramount film — which has Cruise’s Maverick teaching a new class of Top Gun recruits — is expected to make roughly $120 million for its three-day opening. That will easily make “Maverick” the highest-grossing debut in Cruise’s 40 year career, overtaking “War of the Worlds,” which opened to $64.8 million in 2005.\n\nCruise and Paramount are already on target for a big weekend, with the film making $51.8 million for its opening day.

Cruise has gone all out, from landing a helicopter on the deck of an aircraft carrier for the film’s premiere to terrifying James Corden in a jet to showcasing “Maverick” at the Cannes Film Festival, where it inspired a five-minute-long standing ovation.\n\n“‘Maverick’ is virtually assured to become his biggest career opening at this point,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, told CNN Business. “Everything is in its favor, from strong reviews to social media buzz, ticket pre-sales, and an eager audience that has waited for a sequel to his career-making role for a very long time.”\n\nRobbins added that younger moviegoers “drive the lion’s share of box office business,” but even though “Maverick” comes 36 years after the original, it still matters.\n\n“Make no mistake, this is still a very important film for helping to bring back more pandemic era stragglers of a certain age that can still make a difference for the overall health of the industry as it continues to recover,” Robbins said.\n\nClimbing Back Up The Mountain\n\nParamount is having a great year.

It’s been more than a decade since Paramount placed first in yearly box office market share.\n\nYet the studio is doing great in 2022, and is currently in third place thanks to hit films “Scream,” “The Lost City” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2.” Paramount has even made more than Disney (DIS) so far this year. And with “Maverick” set to take off this weekend, Paramount’s 2022 could fly even higher.\n\n“Paramount has been one of the studios at the forefront of movie going’s rebound,” Robbins said. “From a philosophical standpoint, because of what their presence on the big screen has meant for theatrical exhibition, it might very well prove to be one of the most important years in Paramount’s storied history.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/entertainment/mid-budget-movie-decline-cec/index.html", "title": "Mid-budget movies as we knew them are in decline. What does that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany have lamented the perceived demise of the mid-budget movie in recent years.\n\nThese movies – everything from romantic comedies like “Sleepless in Seattle” to dramas like “Philadelphia” or “Good Will Hunting” – used to be common; theaters were filled with an assortment of comedies and biopics and whodunits.\n\nOver the last few years, though, the film landscape has been changing, moving more toward the realm of big-budget movies with gargantuan marketing campaigns. The shift has been chronicled extensively – remakes of “The Lion King” or the upcoming “The Little Mermaid” signal a retreat to old ideas, and flicks about superheroes like Spider-Man are a dime a dozen.\n\nThere are many differing definitions of what exactly a “mid-budget” film is. Generally, it’s a movie that lies in the space between an art house indie flick and big-budget thriller, something like a “Home Alone” or a “Shawshank Redemption.” Some say they cost between $5 million and $75 million, others would say between $15 million to $60 million. Many are genre films, and they are widely consumed and loved, though sometimes without the artful aesthetics that make an indie darling.\n\n“Courtroom dramas, all that stuff, they can’t get made,” actor Matt Damon said in an interview last year. “You want the most accessible thing you can make, in terms of language and culture. And what is that? A superhero movie.”\n\nBut to say that mid-budget movies don’t exist anymore isn’t completely true, film experts said. Like other art and media, they’ve changed. And the culture around movies has changed with them.\n\nBig studios want big blockbusters, especially during Covid\n\nDamon, who has long been outspoken about the decline of the mid-budget, middlebrow film, isn’t completely wrong though.\n\nWhile still in production, horror, thriller, romance, biography and drama films all saw declines in their budgets, according to a 2017 analysis by film data researcher Stephen Follows.\n\nBecause of Covid-19, the budgets from those years are not directly comparable to film production budgets in a pandemic, Follows said. But they do demonstrate a declining trend in investment.\n\nDaniel Loría is an editorial director at Boxoffice Pro, covering global cinema. Big studios, like Warner Bros. or Disney, are dabbling less and less in the mid-budget movie, he explained, opting to instead invest in larger blockbuster releases which will make more money. (Warner Bros. and CNN are both part of WarnerMedia.) But in order for these blockbusters to be successful, they need to appeal to international audiences, too. So movies that may be culturally specific to the US don’t necessarily get the same amount of investment, he said.\n\n“What we’re seeing now, studios are releasing fewer movies to movie theaters,” Loría said. “But the ones they do … they’re swinging for the fences, they’re going for a home run.”\n\nAs Damon put it: “A superhero movie.”\n\nThis trend isn’t new, Loría said, but it’s one that’s been accelerated by the pandemic. Sure, there was a slowdown of these mid-budget movies before, but films like “Hustlers” or “Knives Out” were still in theaters and they still made money.\n\n\"Knives Out\" (2019), made on a $40 million budget, was a smash hit and indicative of the kind of movies that used to be more common in Hollywood. Lionsgate\n\nNow, those movies show up on streaming platforms – even “Knives Out 2” will come to Netflix this fall – where they may not be marketed as heavily, or simply get lost in the endless shuffle of movie titles. Unlike in the 1990s, the peak of mid-budget movies, these films have a lot more to compete with, too, making it even harder to make money, film writer Girish Shambu said.\n\n“In a post-pandemic market, what makes $60 million isn’t the same,” Loría explained.\n\nMid-budget films move to streaming and get lost\n\nStreaming’s rising influence in our culture plays a significant role here. Whereas movie studios typically want to reach as broad an audience as possible, streaming services are all about the niche: attempting to appeal to very specific audiences through algorithms. For that strategy to be successful, these services want to collect a wide variety of films within a specific genre. It’s in their best financial interest, industry experts previously told CNN.\n\nThat’s why, for example, more romantic comedies are seemingly released on streaming than in theaters. Streaming gives us more of the same, more of what “the algorithm” thinks we will want.\n\nWhen mid-range movies get theatrical releases, there’s a leap of faith involved, said Maggie Hennefeld, a cultural studies professor at the University of Minnesota. Audiences can encounter something new or weird, even if it’s not that great.\n\nThere’s also community in a theater: the whole row erupting in laughter during a comedy, or the collective gasp during a horror movie. Streaming platforms erase these intangibles, often reducing the experience to consumption.\n\n“When you make a decision to go out of your house, to go to a movie theater … you’re not going out to watch content, you’re going to watch a movie,” Loría said.\n\nSimply the act of going to the movies and all that entails – the tickets, the drive, maybe the babysitter – requires some sort of time and energy investment from the viewer, he said. But because of the ambient nature of television, and our cultural habit of using the TV as background noise, deciding to stay home and stream is an inherently different and less immersive experience.\n\nEven if a mid-budget movie on a streaming service manages to break through the noise, and manages to be well-made and interesting, there can still be a disconnect.\n\n“When you’re at home, that relationship is much less special,” Loría said.\n\nStill, it’s not an easy path forward. Mid-budget movies released in theaters can still get lost, as some viewers may avoid seeing a movie in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLoría used the recently released “Marry Me” as an example. Three years ago, that film would have only been in theaters, at least for the first few months. Now, it’s simultaneously on Peacock, NBC’s streaming service, meaning a lot of people will choose to watch it that way instead.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson starred in 2022's \"Marry Me,\" directed by Kat Coiro. Barry Wetcher/Universal Pictures\n\nUnlike mid-budget movies, expensive blockbuster movies need movie theaters in order to do well – it’s just the way the business model is set up, Loría said. It’s why these big movies, like “No Time To Die” or “Spider-Man: No Way Home” are still getting theatrical releases, rather than going straight to streaming.\n\nBut the movie theaters themselves can’t survive through blockbusters alone. There’s simply not enough of them, and the shift could result in less movies being shown theatrically, which could spell trouble for smaller local theaters.\n\nFewer movies at the theater means many people will simply go less often, opting instead to watch something on a streaming service. In small and medium-sized cities, where there’s less of a demand for art house and indie movies to help fill space between big releases, that could be a problem, Loría said.\n\nShifting to streaming changes film culture\n\nAt the end of the day, Hollywood is like any industry: It wants to make money. The superhero movies, the remakes – they work.\n\nBut the effect all this has on film writ large is a bit messier.\n\nMJ (Zendaya) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) jump off the bridge in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home.\" Matt Kennedy/Sony Pictures\n\n“You try to go to a producer today and say you want to make a film that hasn’t been made before; they will throw you out because they want the same film that works, that makes money,” said director Francis Ford Coppola in 2011. “That tells me that although the cinema in the next 100 years is going to change a lot, it will slow down because they don’t want you to risk anymore. They don’t want you to take chances.”\n\nOf course, funding has always been an issue for directors. Kelly Reichardt (known for “First Cow”) told GQ in 2020 that she had at one point given up on feature filmmaking after spending 10 years trying to get a movie made. In 2018, Debra Granik also spoke of the challenges that face her and other directors.\n\n“Some of the subject matters that I like to make stories about are definitely not inherently commercial,” said Granik, who directed “Winter’s Bone” and “Leave No Trace.” “So I have to look for very special kind of financing and go down a very gentle path in order to make my films, as do basically all social-realist filmmakers. It’s a long process.”\n\nThe joy of a theatrical mid-budget, with the backing of a big studio, is the money. These movies can be made for $30 million and can attract high-profile actors – all leading to a fuller realization of a director’s vision, explained Shambu. That studios are decreasing their investments in those types of mid-budgets, just as more women and people of color are being offered more opportunities to direct and create their own films, is a trend Shambu finds ironic.\n\nShambu pointed to Jane Campion, the second woman ever to be nominated for best director at the Academy Awards in 1993 for “The Piano,” and the first to be nominated twice – most recently, for “Power of the Dog” – as an example.\n\n“Why aren’t there 20 like her being given money?” he said. “Why is Hollywood going back to the same well-known names?”\n\nWell-known names are struggling, too. Even Spike Lee – prolific since the 1980s – had trouble getting funding for his latest movie, 2020’s “Da 5 Bloods,” about four Black Vietnam war veterans. The Oscar-winning director said he went to every studio, but received rejection after rejection. Eventually, the film found a home on Netflix.\n\nIsiah Whitlock Jr., Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors star in Lee's \"Da 5 Bloods.\" David Lee/Netflix/_DSC0365/David Lee/Netflix\n\n“We barely got this film made,” Lee said in 2020. “There was nowhere to go after Netflix.”\n\nThere’s some good, though.\n\nMore people have been discovering films from decades past, revisiting underappreciated classics, Hennefeld said. She has noticed more theaters dedicated to playing classic films, as well as the rise of streamers like Criterion and Mubi. Though their appeal is still kind of niche, she thinks that’s changing.\n\n“The archives are the future,” she said.\n\nThere’s also easier access to foreign films, Shambu said, noting that Netflix has acquired lots of films and television from India – more than he could get in the 1990s.\n\n“It’s allowing us to see a diversity of makers and also a diversity of geography,” he said. “That’s something that didn’t quite exist before. You could still watch foreign films, but they weren’t easy to find.”\n\nThere’s more highbrow television now, too – which has now been attracting big-name directors like Steven Soderbergh and Steve McQueen. A variety of series have been tackling a lot of the genres that used to be covered in a 90-minute movie.\n\nA film on Jean-Michel Basquiat, for example, may have been a biopic 10 years ago. In 2022, his story is set to be a limited series.\n\nThose looking for the beauty of a mid-budget film in theaters, then, may simply be looking in the wrong place.", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/16/media/scream-box-office-opening/index.html", "title": "'Scream' dethrones 'Spider-Man' with a solid box office debut | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nEven Spider-Man isn’t safe from Ghostface.\n\nParamount’s “Scream” — the fifth installment in the long running slasher franchise — notched an estimated $30.6 million at the North American box office this weekend, according to the studio. That number exceeded industry expectations, which had projected the film to make closer to $25 million in its weekend debut.\n\n“Scream” also took the No. 1 spot, dethroning “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” which has been the top box office draw for roughly a month.\n\nParamount said the film is projected to make $35 million over the four day holiday weekend.

This goes back to the 1996 original, which in many ways changed horror by having characters in the film who had actually seen scary movies.\n\nThe other reason “Scream” succeeded is that it nabbed good reviews from critics. The film currently has a 75% score on review site, Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIt also helped that there wasn’t much competition at the ticket booth this weekend.\n\nAll in all, “Scream” didn’t break any records, but it kicks off an important year for theaters with a solid performance.\n\nLast year saw theaters reopen after a year that shuttered cineplexes and delayed blockbusters.

They will make “one last push for glory” in Istanbul and “few will bet against them finally claiming their Holy Grail”, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport. The “big question” is do the Nerazzurri have enough to stop City emulating United’s treble of 1999?\n\nSince the Abu Dhabi United Investment Group acquired Man City in 2008, the club has been “transformed” from “mid-table mediocracy” to a “global footballing powerhouse”, said Felix Richter on Statista. However, City’s success has “always been eyed with suspicion”, as it “wouldn’t have been possible without the financial muscle of its Emirati owners”. The success has also come at a “high price”. Despite a net transfer spend of a “whopping” €1.45bn since 2008, the club has only reached one Champions League final – in 2021 where they lost 1-0 to Premier League rivals Chelsea.\n\nCity will go to Istanbul as big favourites to win the game. But until they actually get their hands on the trophy can they be ranked as a giant of European football. Speaking after the FA Cup final, Guardiola admitted that “now is the first time we can talk about the treble”. He said: “We have done incredible, five Premier Leagues, two FA Cups and Carabaos but we have to win the Champions League to be recognised how the team deserves to be. It has been amazing, been fun, but we have to win it.” City’s Spanish midfielder Rodri added: “I think Pep said that you will not be ‘big, big’ if you don’t win in Europe. It’s the exam we have to pass.”\n\nChampions League final key details\n\nWho: Manchester City (Eng) vs. Inter (Ita)\n\nManchester City (Eng) vs. Inter (Ita) When: Saturday 10 June 2023\n\nSaturday 10 June 2023 Where: Atatürk Olympic Stadium, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nAtatürk Olympic Stadium, Istanbul, Turkey Time: 8pm kick-off (BST)\n\n8pm kick-off (BST) Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland)\n\nLive TV and radio coverage\n\nThe Champions League final will kick-off at 8pm (BST) on Saturday 10 June. In the UK, BT Sport will show exclusive live coverage on its 1HD and Ultimate channels and the broadcaster will also show the match free-to-air via its mobile and TV app, online at btsport.com/final, on Virgin and its YouTube channel. BT Sport’s build-up to the final will begin at 6pm. BBC Radio 5 Live Sport will have live radio commentary from the Atatürk Olympic Stadium.\n\nAtatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul (Image credit: Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe stadium\n\nThis is the second Champions League final to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium. Located in the Başakşehir area of Istanbul, west of the Bosphorus, the stadium boasts a seated capacity of more than 75,000. The Atatürk previously hosted the classic final between Liverpool and AC Milan in 2005. Dubbed the “miracle of Istanbul”, Liverpool came back from 3-0 down at half-time to draw 3-3 before going on to lift the trophy after a penalty shoot-out.\n\nPundit predictions\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight’s Soccer Power Index (SPI) ratings, City have a 75% chance of winning the final compared to Inter’s 25%. “Ultimately”, however, the final “isn’t a lock” for City by any means even if they are the favourites, said Paul Kasabian on Bleacher Report. Inter could come out and “play the game of their lives”, or City could “struggle mightily”. Anything can happen in a single match. On paper, the guess is that City will win “comfortably” as they are “simply too good everywhere on the pitch”. The pick is for City to win 3-1, said Kasabian.\n\n“Everything – literally everything – is pointing towards a Manchester City win here,” said Opta Analyst. The “only hope” for Inter is that their opponents “aren’t quite at their best, and get some key decisions wrong when the ball is in dangerous areas of the pitch”. The Opta “supercomputer” gives City a “64.6% probability” of winning in 90 minutes, compared to “just 16.4%” for Inter. Overall on the night, City are given a 74.1% chance of lifting the trophy. “It will take something special for Inter to deny City the treble they are chasing.”\n\nWill City make up for their loss in the final two years ago and “finally become champions of Europe”, or will Inter “beat the odds” and claim the continental crown for the fourth time in their history, asked ESPN. City “will win”, and “relatively comfortably”, 3-0, said Rob Dawson. There’s “no pretending” that City are “anything but overwhelming favourites”, said Gab Marcotti. “So I’m going for a 2-0 City win.” No way City are letting this one go, said Julien Laurens. Expect a “tough game against a low Inter block”, but a “moment of magic” from Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland or Bernardo Silva will “win it 1-0 for City”.\n\nGuardiola’s team will “surely never have a better chance” of winning the Champions League, and in turn a famous treble, said Alex Young in the London Evening Standard. “That is not to say that Inter are pushovers.” Guardiola “infamously tinkered too much” when City lost to Chelsea in the final two years ago, “so there is always that danger”. But you would think “any selection should overpower Inter” tomorrow night. “Man City to win 2-0.”\n\nI would back Manchester City, but I’ve seen this “too many times” in the past – “people expected them to turn up against Chelsea two years ago”, said Paul Merson on SportsKeeda. Inter “absolutely demolished” AC in the derby and “if they pull off a similar start”, they “have a chance”. The “only thing that could trip City up is nerves”. Merson predicts a 3-1 win for the English club.\n\nIt’s not just the pundits and data experts who have had their say on Saturday’s final – but also players from rival clubs. At last weekend’s Formula 1 Spanish Grand Prix, Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe and Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold both “revealed their predictions”, The Sun reported. Mbappe believes the final will be a “great game” and he thinks that City “are going to win”. Alexander-Arnold “appeared to agree” and told Sky Sports: “I think Man City are always the favourites for everything!”\n\nErling Haaland has scored 52 goals so far this season for Man City (Image credit: Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nBetting odds\n\nAccording to Oddschecker, City are the heavy favourites to lift the Champions League trophy tomorrow night. The English side are priced at 10/21 to win, Inter are 13/2 and the draw is 4/1. With 52 goals in his debut season at City, including 12 in the Champions League, Erling Haaland is priced at 12/5 to score the first goal in the final. The prolific Norwegian striker is also 14/1 to net a hat-trick.

The Spaniard believes City will need to win all of their remaining matches if they are to retain the championship.\n\n“We know now that one game and a dropped result, then we will not be champions,” he said. “Will it be easy? Absolutely not but it will be difficult for them too. Seven games in the Premier League is a lot [to win] – they are tough games and they have tough games.”\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insisted his team would “not stop chasing” the champions and compared the rivalry to two heavyweight boxers. “We can describe it like a boxing fight,” the German said. “Both arms down for a second and you get a massive knock. You can shake it off a bit and then the next knock is coming from the other team. Now it is seven games to go for both teams. We will not stop chasing now. That is clear.”\n\nSee more\n\nPundit predictions: who will win the title?\n\nBefore the start of the season, City, Chelsea and Liverpool were the favourites to win the Premier League. Now it’s a two-horse race. Here we look at the pundit predictions for the title with seven matches remaining.\n\nThe “enthralling” 2-2 draw leaves the title race “finely poised as we enter the final six weeks of the campaign”, said the Daily Mail. The paper’s Sportsmail team has “looked into its crystal ball” to predict the outcome of each side’s remaining fixtures. They tip Man City to get six wins and one draw from their seven matches to finish with 93 points. However, the Mail predicts that it will be Liverpool who end up as champions, winning their remaining seven games and finishing with 94 points – just one more than City.\n\nIn a manner “neither of these formidable teams are likely to”, “we’ve bottled it a bit”, said Dom Farrell on The Sporting News, which has also predicted the results of the key fixtures. “We have each of City and Liverpool winning six and drawing one of the remaining games and Guardiola claiming his fourth title in five seasons by the solitary point advantage in place today.”\n\nIt should be a title race that will “go down in top-flight folklore”, said Matt Whiley on Planet Sport. After looking at the fixtures and “using some good old-fashioned stats”, he predicts Liverpool to pip Manchester City to the title by two points.\n\nThere are “five key games” that will decide who becomes champions, said the i news site. The key clashes will be Liverpool’s home fixtures against Manchester United and Tottenham and City’s away matches at Leeds and West Ham and their home game against Aston Villa.\n\nAccording to Oddschecker.com, the bookies have Man City as 4/9 favourites to win the Premier League while Liverpool are priced at 15/8.\n\n(Image credit: Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nPremier League run-in: which fixtures are left?\n\nThe rest of Man City’s league fixtures – four at home and three away – “seems favourable in comparison to Liverpool’s”, said Jeorge Bird on The Sporting News. However, in their final three matches City come up against “complicated” opponents: Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa. Liverpool “clearly have a tougher run-in than City” and it “certainly won’t be easy” for Klopp’s team.

However, a mass exodus of players — including Pulisic — is expected this summer, according to ESPN. Since an ownership group led by American Todd Boehly took over in May 2022, Chelsea has experienced a chaotic existence. The club added 18 new players at a cost of approximately $650 million. The club fired manager Thomas Tuchel, then brought in a new manager in Graham Potter on a five-year contract, only to fire him after 31 matches. Former England national team and Premier League star Frank Lampard was appointed interim manager in April.\n\nAll of that change has not helped on the pitch, as Chelsea — which won the UEFA Champions League just two years ago — currently sits in 11th place in the Premier League table.\n\nWith Chelsea going through three managers in four years, Pulisic has been unable to secure a consistent starting position with the club. The influx of new players recently means Chelsea will be looking to offload the USMNT star, as well as other notable players such as strikers Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Romelu Lukaku (who is on loan at Inter Milan), midfielder Mateo Kovacic and defender Kalidou Koulibaly.\n\nWho are other USMNT players in Premier League Summer Series?\n\nPulisic isn't the only USMNT player who could be participating in the Premier League Summer Series. Fulham features American defenders Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson, each of whom played significant roles for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nBusy summer of soccer in U.S.\n\nThe Premier League Summer Series will be competing for the American soccer fan's attention amid a number of competitions taking place this summer.\n\nThe women's World Cup kicks off on July 20, with the USWNT playing its first game on July 21 against Vietnam at 9 p.m. ET in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nOn the heels of the completion of the CONCACAF Gold Cup on July 16, the Leagues Cup — a unique competition featuring every team in Major League Soccer and Mexico's Liga MX — kicks off on July 21.

If they knock out a big team, or enjoy a “giant killing”, things can “really go to pot”.\n\nIn recent seasons, some fans and pundits have declared that the “magic” of the FA Cup is dead, The Sun reported.

Sutton United beating holders Coventry City 2-1 in 1989 and Woking’s “16 million to one” victory over West Brom in 1991 will also be remembered as some of the “greatest” FA Cup shocks, FourFourTwo said.\n\nWith “upsets, drama and chaos”, this year’s third round was a “classic”, the BBC reported. Cambridge United “grabbed the headlines” with a “fairytale” win at St James’ Park against Newcastle. There were also notable victories for Kidderminster Harriers, against Reading, and fellow non-league side Boreham Wood, who beat League One AFC Wimbledon.\n\nFor Boreham Wood their FA Cup adventure would next take them to Championship outfit Bournemouth for the fourth round – and their fairytale run would continue…\n\n‘On top of the world’\n\nPlaying an opponent 74 places higher in the pyramid, National League side Boreham Wood recorded a “famous giant killing” as the fifth-tier team beat Bournemouth 1-0 on Sunday, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe first-half winning goal from 37-year-old captain Mark Ricketts sent the Hertfordshire club into the fifth round for the first time in their history – where they will now play a money-spinning tie against Premier League side Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nBoreham Wood boss Luke Garrard was “in tatters” after the victory at the Vitality Stadium. Admitting that he thought Bournemouth would “hit us for eight”, he hailed his “unbelievable” players. “I am on top of the world,” he said. “We are such a dysfunctional family, but that is what is helping get us our results. To a man, staff, people in the boardroom, this is for them.”\n\nBoreham Wood were not the only ones celebrating a cupset. It was a good weekend for Championship clubs facing Premier League opponents. Middlesbrough defeated Manchester United 8-7 on penalties at Old Trafford and Nottingham Forest thrashed holders Leicester City 4-1.\n\n‘Intriguing ties’ up next\n\nThe magic of the FA Cup is “alive and kicking this season”, the Daily Mirror said. And fans across the land will hope to see more shocks in the fifth round, which takes place in the week commencing Monday 28 February.\n\nEverton vs. Boreham Wood is the obvious highlight of the draw, but Luton Town vs. Chelsea and Peterborough United vs. Manchester City also provide some “intriguing ties”, talkSPORT said.\n\nFA Cup fifth-round draw", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Jamie Timson", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/11/12/maggie-haberman-nyt-reporter-has-deal-donald-trump-book/6262777002/", "title": "Maggie Haberman, NYT reporter, has deal for Donald Trump book", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — One of the top chroniclers of the Trump administration, New York Times White House reporter Maggie Haberman, has a book deal.\n\nPenguin Press announced Thursday that the Pulitzer Prize winner’s book, currently untitled, would come out in 2022.\n\n“Maggie Haberman’s book will be an instant classic, a definitive and fascinating account of Donald Trump, his life and his presidency,” Penguin vice president and publisher Scott Moyers said in a statement . “An award winning journalist deeply sourced in Trump World, Maggie has had a front row seat to the last four years and knows as well as anyone the impact it has had on our politics and the country.”\n\nHaberman, now 47, began writing about Trump more than 20 years ago, for the New York Post, and continued at the New York Daily News and Politico before joining the Times in 2015.

The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/12/coronavirus-impact-ncaa-nfl-nba-nhl-baseball-what-we-know/5030927002/", "title": "Coronavirus impact on NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL, baseball and what ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWith the coronavirus impacting sports around the world and developments occurring almost hourly, what we know about how leagues in the United States and North America are being affected by and are addressing the pandemic is very fluid.\n\nFrom canceling the NCAA basketball tournaments to suspending the NBA season, this is an unprecedented time in the history of American athletic endeavors. Where will we be at the end of this weekend, much less the end of the month?\n\nAs we await word on other developments across the spectrum, here is a look at what we know now about the state of sports in the U.S.:\n\nNCAA\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThursday afternoon, the NCAA took the unprecedented step of canceling its showcase event, the men's Division basketball tournament. Also canceled was the women's tournament along with all remaining winter championships -- including wrestling and ice hockey -- and all spring championships -- including baseball, softball and lacrosse.\n\nBy midday Thursday, Division I conferences began cancelling their basketball tournaments. Of the major leagues, only the Big East had begun playing, but stopped at hafltime of its first game between Creighton and St. John's and canceled the rest of the tournament.\n\nNBA\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nThe league suspended its season after a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus. There is no indication when games will resume. Teams that have recently played the Jazz have been asked to quarantine their players and personnel. In the meantime, a second Jazz player has tested positive.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nPlayoffs are supposed to start April 18. It is unclear if that will happen. The league said it will \"use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.\" On Thursday night, commissioner Adam Silver said the shutdown would last at least 30 days.\n\nMLB\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nMajor League Baseball announced Thursday it is halting spring training games and will delay Opening Day by at least two weeks. The regular season was scheduled to begin on March 26. The league's action was inevitable as cities around the country have already banned large public gatherings.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nIt is unclear what the delay does to the postseason which stretches almost into November or how the league would make up games -- if they even do -- with so few off days in a season.\n\nNHL\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nWith NBA and NHL teams using many of the same home arenas for home games, it made sense for the NHL to follow suit and suspend the remaining games of the regular season indefinitely, which the league announced Thursday afternoon. Prior to that official decision, the league advised teams not to hold morning skates, meetings or practices Thursday morning.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe original league calendar called for the regular season to end on April 4 and the playoffs to begin that week. That timetable is likely untenable now, but the league said in its statement announcing the pause that \"our goal is to resume play as soon as it is appropriate and prudent, so that we will be able to complete the season and award the Stanley Cup.\"\n\nPGA/LPGA\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nAfter starting the opening round of The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass on Thursday without spectators present, the PGA Tour reversed course later in the evening and called off the tournament.\n\nThe Tour also announced that its next three tournaments -- through the Valero Texas Open, which was scheduled to begin April 2 in San Antonio -- have also been canceled.\n\nThe LPGA postponed the next three events on its schedule: the Volvik Founders Cup, March 19-22 in Phoenix, Ariz.; the Kia Classic, March 26-29 in Carlsbad, Calif.; and the ANA Inspiration April 2-5 in Rancho Mirage, Calif.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nGolf's most prestigious tournament and the year's first major, the Masters, is scheduled to begin April 9 in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nThe next event on the schedule is the LOTTE Championship in Hawaii, slated for April 15-18. The LPGA hopes to be able to reschedule its missed tournaments later in the season.\n\nNFL\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nBeyond the cancellation of the annual league meeting and Friday's announcement barring teams from hosting workouts or attending pro days, the offseason calendar hasn't undergone any significant shifts so far. The new league year and free agency are still set to begin on March 18, and NFL players must vote by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. on the proposed collective bargaining agreement. The Redskins, Jets and Vikings, among others, have pulled coaches and scouts from the road while suspending travel plans, and the Browns and Steelers are limiting commercial flights for coaches and scouts. Many other teams, however, told USA TODAY Sports they were operating as usual for the time being and adhering to CDC recommendations. A league-sponsored combine for historically black colleges and universities that had been set for March 27-29 in Davie, Florida, has also been canceled.\n\nMultiple NFL draft prospects have had teams cancel workouts, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe NFL draft is scheduled to be held in Las Vegas on April 23-25, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported the league was making contingency plans for the event.\n\nXFL\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nThe inaugural XFL season has been suspended, after each team had played five of the 10 games on their regular-season schedules. The league says it is \"committed to playing a full season in 2021 and future years.\"\n\nTennis\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nThe ATP Tour announced Thursday that its tennis tour would be shutting down for six weeks. The WTA's next three events — the Miami Open, the Volvo Car Open in Charleston, South Carolina and the Copa Colsanitas in Bogota, Colombia — were canceled because of the coronavirus.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe WTA released a statement in which chairman and CEO Steve Simon said in part: \"The WTA, working alongside our player and tournament leaders, will make a decision in the week ahead regarding the European clay court season.\"\n\nThe French Open is scheduled to begin in Paris on May 24, but there is no word yet on plans for the season's second Grand Slam.\n\nSoccer\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nU.S. Soccer has canceled all men's and women's senior national team matches in March and April. Meanwhile, the Under-23 Men's National Team is remaining in Guadalajara, Mexico, for the CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying tournament that runs through April 1.\n\nThe MLS season has been suspended for at least 30 days. Teams have only played two games.\n\nThe Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup has been postponed. The first three rounds of the competition were scheduled for March 24-25, April 7-9 and April 21-23.\n\nThe NWSL has canceled its preseason and \"reviewing all contingency plans related to our regular-season schedule\" -- which is slated to begin April 18.\n\nWhat events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe U.S. Men's National Team is scheduled to play its next match in the CONCACAF Nations League on June 4 in Houston.\n\nWhether MLS could resume with a shortened season or not play might not won't be determined for a while. The playoffs do not begin until October.\n\nOverseas, UEFA announced Friday it was suspending play in both the Champions League and Europa League as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The match between Real Madrid and Manchester City had already been postponed due to Real Madrid players and staff self-quarantining due to potential exposure (a club basketball player tested positive for COVID-19). Juventus' match against Lyon was also previously postponed.\n\nSeveral matches in Europe this week took place in empty stadiums. The top professional league in Spain (La Liga) has suspended play and the Premier League in England has been suspended until at least April 3. That decision came after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi both tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nAuto racing\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nSunday's Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway will be held without fans in attendance, NASCAR announced Thursday. Drivers, crews, officials and \"other necessary personnel to conduct the race\" are the only individuals allowed. The Dixie Vodka 400 race at Homestead-Miami Speedway set for next Saturday will also be off-limit to fans. IndyCar announced its season opener in St. Petersburg, Florida, would be held this weekend but without fans.\n\nThe remaining portion of this weekend's NHRA Gatornationals in Gainesville, Florida, will not be run.

NASCAR's season runs into November. \"We will work with public health officials as we determine future scheduling beyond these events,\" NASCAR said in statement.\n\nWith large-scale events banned through the end of next month, the IndyCar Grand Prix of Long Beach -- scheduled for April 19 -- will not be held. Promoters and city officials are trying to reschedule the race later in the year. There's been no decision on the status of the April 5 IndyCar race in Alabama.\n\nThe F1 Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled for April 19, has already been postponed, and the Bahrain GP is expected to go ahead on March 22 at a circuit without fans.\n\nMMA\n\nWhat is being done in response to the coronavirus?\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ted Lamont signed an executive order Thursday that prohibits public gatherings in excess of 250 people. However, Bellator 241 will go on as scheduled Friday night at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville without fans in attendance.\n\nBecause the Mohegan Tribe is a sovereign nation, it technically is not ruled by an executive order from the governor, a commission spokesperson told MMA Junkie on Thursday. But in this case, the promotion and commission will honor the ruling.\n\n​What events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe UFC event set for Saturday in Brasilia, Brazil, will also take place without fans due to several positive coronavirus tests there. Another major UFC event is scheduled to take place Saturday, March 28 in Columbus, Ohio. There's been no official announcement yet on its status.\n\nIn Poland, KSW 53 -- originally set for March 21 in Lodz -- has been canceled.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS\n\n​What events could be affected by the coronavirus?\n\nThe New York State Public High School Athletic Association announced on Thursday that all winter championships would be postponed indefinitely. The N.Y. state basketball, ice hockey and bowling tournaments were among those affected.\n\nContributing: Paul Myerberg, Jori Epstein, Mike Brehm, Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, Michelle Martinelli, Steve DiMeglio, Chris Bumbaca, Steve Gardner.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/05/22/summer-concerts-phoenix-2019-lil-wayne-blink-182-khalid-rascal-flatts-21-savage-jennifer-lopez/3673507002/", "title": "Summer concerts in Phoenix: Dave Matthews Band, Mumford ...", "text": "The Rolling Stones, two former Beatles and the Cream guitarist who dropped by to solo on “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” are among the legendary artists returning to Phoenix in a summer concert season that also brings a double bill of Brian Wilson and the Zombies.\n\nAnd those are just the living legends.\n\nSummer also brings Dave Matthews Band, Mumford & Sons and John Mayer, to name a few of the higher-profile artists swinging through the Valley between now and late September.\n\nHere's a look at those and other summer highlights, from Ak-Chin Pavilion to Cross Record at the Trunk Space.\n\n9/1: Ryley Walker\n\nThis experimental singer-songwriter released two albums last year. \"Deafman Glance\" was saluted in Classic Rock Magazine as \"Tim Buckley to Beefheart to Bert Jansch and beyond.\" And he followed through with \"The Lillywhite Sessions,\" a full-scale deconstruction of the Dave Matthews Band's unreleased (but bootlegged) album of the same name.

In the three years since her previous release, the singer went through a divorce, quit drinking, become a death doula, started the observational podcast “What I’m Looking At” and toured and recorded with Loma, the trio she formed with Dan Duszynski and Jonathan Meiburg. After setting the tone with an experimental mood piece that finds her repeating the line \"What is your wish?\" she settles into an album that favors more song-oriented fare without abandoning the eccentricities that make that first track what it is. The result will leave you haunted.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 5. The Trunk Space, 1124 N.

The album follows 2017's “Moh Lhean,” which found him adopting a more reflective world view in the wake of a health scare while at the same time drifting into haunted psychedelic folk. As PopMatters noted, “It’s as if he has suddenly come to terms with his place in the world and that has translated into music which is warmer, looser, and more liberated.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6.

Q magazine calls it \"a stunning, stealthy, faintly malevolent collection of songs that serve as a reminder of this songwriter's power and innovation.\" It's kind of amazing how much of her edge she's managed to retain more than 30 years after grabbing our attention by the throat.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 8.

The only holdout from their glory years in this year's model is Ginn, who's joined by professional skateboarder Mike Vallely on lead vocals.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10.

They're fronted by singer-guitarists Devon Allman (Gregg's son) and Duane Betts (Dickey's son, whose first name is a tip of the hat to the late Duane Allman). And their bassist is Berry Duane Oakley, the son of Allmans bassist Berry Oakley. None of this would matter if they didn't rise to the occasion with an album that honors the family tradition in style and substance.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 10-11.

They're playing Mesa on a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary. \"The Wilderness,\" their latest album, earned a perfect score from the reviewer at the Austin Chronicle, who called it \"textured, ornate, and somehow seeping into the deepest parts of you.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved \"The Wilderness,\" calling is \"thrillingly foreign yet familiar in its finest moments.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

But despite the introspective nature of the lyrics and the way the first song sounds like it was captured in the middle of a dream, it doesn’t feel like the work of a bedroom-pop auteur. Too many of the album’s highlights rock too much to warrant that description, from the richly orchestrated pop charms of “The Bus Song” to the post-punk grinding of “1 Billion Dogs.” And the followup will be here by the time she gets to Phoenix.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

And it's doubtful anyone regretted helping Morris grab that title assuming they came for the country-pop crossover bids that made her such a hot commodity, including a featured vocal spot on Zedd's triple-platinum \"The Middle.\"\n\nDetails: 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 12.

The man has been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on three occasions, as a member of the Yardbirds, then with Cream and finally, in recognition of his solo work.

And the timing couldn't be more perfect. As PopMatters wrote, \"'Disturbance' is precisely what the dark uncertainty of the present moment calls for: a primeval blending of ancient ambiance and modern tech, building fast and furious into a soundtrack that batters the fragile Quotidien present with a beautiful rage into which the listener yearns to hurl themselves, body and soul.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 14.

The resulting sheen may leave some listeners wishing for a rawness to match the emotion, but Clash magazine felt it \"lends a progressive edge to the record that takes time to soak in, but ultimately rewards.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 17.

Well, he's still on the road five years later, offering the upscale country hits (and pop crossovers) that gave him more than 30 chart-toppers. The 74-year-old's best moments — \"Daydreams About Night Things,\" \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\" and his oh-so-smooth take on Burt Bacharach's \"Any Day Now\" — have certainly held up well.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 6.

And they do it all while weighing in on topics as dark as anxiety, oppression, exploitation and the problematic patriarchy, a bracing reminder that there's more than one path to catharsis.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 6.

From \"Planet Claire\" to \"Dance This Mess Around,\" it still sounds like it dropped in from another, much quirkier planet, wrapped in kitschy day-glo yellow. And it spawned one of the more unlikely mainstream breakthroughs of the decade — \"Rock Lobster,\" a surf-guitar-fueled party track that wore its debt to Yoko Ono proudly on its vintage sleeve.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 14.

As singer Alexis Mincolla describes it, \"If our debut album was focused on man vs. the world, and our sophomore album was man vs. himself, then I really wanted to METAWAR to focus on the idea of world vs world, and the notion that if man doesn’t create his own world then he’s often crushed by the world of another.\" Allmusic hailed the album as a hulking monster that makes shutdown.exe sound tame in comparison.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 15.

And that strikes us as a brilliant introduction. But the more inspired moments of \"Kyle Craft & Showboat Honey\" are closer in spirit to the psychedelic pop years, from the mesmerizing drone of \"Broken Mirror Pose\" to the post-Cream psychedelic blues of \"Oh!

And given the strength of the writing and singing on “Lush,” it’s easy to hear what made them want to go that heavy on the praise.\n\nIt’s like a hit parade of introspective bedroom-pop as Jordan spills the contents of her diary in songs about boredom and sadness and feeling alone with the vulnerability it takes to put those kind of songs across while staying in her comfort zone, with bittersweet on one side, melancholy on the other.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 20.

But those sessions made them realize there was still a lot of life left in the project, inspiring Sputnikmusic to rave, “The shoegaze and dream pop influences from their last several records have mostly been stripped away, leaving behind a pure sludge heavy framework.\" Two years later, they're touring the States with a followup to \"Dear\" called \"LφVE & EVφL\" set to hit the streets sometime this month.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 20.

Richard Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the announcement a \"step in the right direction\" on the Senate floor. A frequent critic of the court, Durbin framed the code as a symbolic victory, even as he raised concerns about how much teeth the document will have.\n\n\"For the first time in history, the Supreme Court of the United States is at least saying to the American people, 'we hear you,'\" Durbin said.\n\nSupreme Court critics: Where's the enforcement?\n\nBut the code itself included no enforcement mechanism, an omission the court's critics immediately jumped on. Outside experts have said enforcing a code of conduct on the Supreme Court would be especially tricky, given that no other tribunal exists that could overrule a decision made by a justice or the court itself.\n\nOthers criticized the court's statement for describing the ethics scandals that have swirled around the court as a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, that reaction, and this code, leave much to be desired,\" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a group that has long advocated for tighter ethics standards at the Supreme Court. \"That it's largely a copy-and-paste job from the lower court's code fails to account for so much.\"\n\nTo say the code of conduct \"fails to meet the moment would be an understatement,\" said Caroline Ciccone, president of a group called Accountable.US, which has been a sharp critic of the court and Thomas. \"After a year of countless ethics issues and mounting pressure to fix its corruption crisis, the court released a set of written − and apparently unenforceable − guidelines.\"\n\nIn a statement attached to the code, the court said that Chief Justice John Roberts had directed court officials to review how state and lower federal courts have helped jurists comply with similar requirements. Roberts noted that some lower courts rely on software to help judges flag potential conflicts of interest in pending cases.\n\nIn other words, it's possible the Supreme Court could take other steps.\n\nThe announcement was an acknowledgment that many Americans were \"ranting and raving\" about the fact that the court had done little to address the criticism over ethics, said Timothy Johnson, a professor of political science and law at the University of Minnesota. On the other hand, he said, the line about looking to other courts was an acknowledgment that \"they haven't fully figured it out yet.\"\n\n\"It's pretty hard to write rules when people are in the middle of breaking whatever rules you might be creating,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"To me, the real question is how the public is supposed to have confidence that the justices are complying with whatever rules they’ve chosen to adopt,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"Even the most rigorous ethics rules of which one might conceive are meaningless if there’s no means of monitoring whether they’re being followed.\"\n\nSupreme Court ethics rules follow months of revelations about Thomas\n\nThe announcement arrived at a moment when the Supreme Court has been heavily criticized after a series of stories this year detailing lavish travel that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from GOP donor Harlan Crow, as well as revelations that Justice Samuel Alito flew to Alaska for a fishing trip on a private jet in 2008 that belonged to a hedge fund manager who repeatedly brought cases before the high court.\n\nThose revelations spurred Democrats in Congress to pursue legislation that would require the Supreme Court to adopt a code of ethics, similar to what lower federal courts follow. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have threatened to subpoena Crow and Leonard Leo, a well-connected conservative legal advocate who has appeared on many of the trips at issue, though that effort was abruptly stalled last week.\n\nIt is not only conservative justices who have been the subject of ethics revelations: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, drew attention this year after a story by the Associated Press documented that some of her aides pressed colleges and a library to order copies of books she had written in connection with public speaking events.\n\nBut Thomas, the most senior associate justice, has been at the center of the bulk of the stories, many of which appeared in ProPublica earlier this year. They include revelations that Crow purchased three Georgia properties from Thomas and members of his family in 2014, a transaction the justice failed to note on his annual disclosure forms.\n\nAnother story documented that Crow had paid private boarding school tuition for a member of Thomas' family. Yet another, published in the New York Times, showed that Thomas purchased an RV with a personal loan from a wealthy health care executive. The terms of that loan have not been disclosed but congressional Democrats say that it appears much of the principle was never repaid before it was ultimately closed.\n\nThomas has repeatedly pushed back on the stories and denied wrongdoing. In a statement released in August, an attorney representing Thomas defended the justice's past reporting and dismissed criticism of the gifts as partisan attacks.\n\nThe attorney, Elliot Berke, blasted Thomas' critics as \"left-wing organizations with largely undisclosed supporters that stand diametrically opposed to his judicial philosophy.\" Berke said that while public figures \"may be the targets of weaponized ethics allegations,… all Americans\" ultimately suffer from the criticism.\n\nWhile Roberts has steadfastly defended the Supreme Court's independence, the chorus of calls for some sort of response to the scandals has shown little sign of quieting this year. Three justices − Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett− in recent weeks all appeared to publicly endorse some form of a conduct code.\n\nAs the criticism has continued, public polling has indicated that trust in the high court remains at record lows. Less than half of Americans said they have confidence in the Supreme Court, according to a Gallup survey in late September. Those polls have tended to show a far higher disapproval of the court among Democrats than Republicans.\n\nThe ethics debate has cast a shadow over the term, which began in October and runs through June. The court has been steadily building a docket that includes some blockbuster controversies, including a case about whether the government can block domestic abusers from owning guns, whether the abortion pill mifepristone will remain widely available and whether courts will have more power to curb federal agencies.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/11/14/supreme-court-gaza-hamas-climate-change-los-angeles-taylor-swift-michigan-jim-harbaugh/71577041007/", "title": "Daily Briefing: First-ever Supreme Court code of conduct", "text": "The Supreme Court announced it will honor a code of conduct for the first time in its 234-year history.

Women aren't getting the care they need when it comes to menopause, heart attacks and other health issues, according to the Biden administration. Now, first lady Jill Biden is giving the administration 45 days to amp up efforts to change that. The goal is to try and correct the fact that women have been understudied and underrepresented in health research – despite making up more than half the population. “If you ask any woman in America about her health care, she probably has a story to tell,\" Biden said Monday.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Tuesday, November 14th, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday what a Supreme Court Code of Conduct means for justices going forward, plus conditions worsen at Gaza hospitals, and we look at a potential solution to the crushing cost of insulin in America.\n\n♦\n\nThe Supreme Court has announced that it will honor a Code of Conduct for the first time in its history. I spoke with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent, John Fritze to better understand what effect this will have on the high court and what led to this moment.\n\nJohn, thanks for hopping on.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThank you, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat does this functionally mean for the court going forward, John?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nWell, I think functionally it's a little unclear and the critics of this code, mostly on the left, have noted that it appears to have virtually no enforcement mechanism. And that's sort of their first and most vociferous criticism of this is that basically this allows the justices to continue to police themselves. I do think what this is though is a symbolic victory for groups that wanted to have a Code of Conduct. It is, at the very least, a recognition by the Supreme Court that they have or had a problem with ethics. And it is a response to this criticism. The Supreme Court does not very often respond to public criticism. It's sort of designed not to do that. The fact that they've done it here, I think, is significant.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. And what exactly led to this moment, John? What sparked the criticism that you're talking about?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nWell, a year of stories about Clarence Thomas is what stemmed this, right? I mean we had these stories earlier in the year about Justice Thomas and his escapades, his wild travel, his lavish private jet flights, and the yacht and exclusive resorts mostly paid for by the same person, Harlan Crow, a wealthy GOP donor. And those stories, I think really caught the public's attention. There's no way to really tie the court's polling to the ethics scandals and disaggregate that from some of the controversial opinions they've had. But I can't imagine the ethics scandals have bolstered the court's public opinion.\n\nNow of course, Thomas is not alone here, right? There was a similar revelation involving Justice Alito. There have been some questions about some property from Justice Gorsuch, and it's not all conservatives. There was a story over the summer about Justice Sotomayor and some of the way her aides handled book deals that she had. She's come under criticism before for book arrangements. She's published several books. And so, I think that is a little bit different than some of these travel stories, but certainly the travel stories have captured the public's attention and also captured the attention of Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJohn, the court said in a statement that it's long had the equivalent of common law. What is that in this context and how does this Code of Conduct differ?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nYeah, I mean I think what Roberts is trying to say here is that, look, we've been sort of doing this already. I'm not sure I would read a whole lot into that. I mean I think there's been a framing of this as a for instance, the Supreme Court for a long time has said, \"Look, we don't have to adhere to disclosure requirements, annual disclosure requirements where we list all of our assets and income. We don't have to do that, but we choose to do it.\" And he's sort of saying a similar thing here. He's saying, \"Look, we've always done this. This is kind of what we've done. But a lot of people don't understand.\" In fact, they twice used the word misunderstanding.\n\nThe misunderstanding language has certainly bothered some on the left who think that what has happened, particularly with Thomas, is far more than a misunderstanding. But I think that's what Roberts is getting at. I think Roberts is saying, \"Look, we sort of internally have had our own kind of internal code,\" but putting it out there publicly like they did, again, I think is a recognition that they had to do something.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, John Fritze covers the Supreme Court for USA Today. Thank you, sir.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters yesterday that hospitals in Gaza must be protected. The comments came as Israeli ground forces closed in on Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza, where more than 3,500 staffers, patients, and sheltering civilians remain inside. Mohammed Zaqout, Director of Hospitals in Gaza said yesterday that there are 36 at-risk newborn babies who need to be evacuated. And World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Sunday that the situation at Al-Shifa was dire and perilous while calling for a ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli military officials say Al-Shifa and other hospitals are housing Hamas operation posts and militants. Hamas denies the claims and says the Israeli military is using them to justify airstrikes while advancing ground forces. The now nearly six-week long war has followed a surprise Hamas attack on October 7th into Israel. Israeli officials recently revised the number of people killed in that attack from 1,400 to 1,200, while around 240 hostages were taken. Israel has said it won't consider a ceasefire until all hostages are released. The Israeli military says 44 soldiers have been killed since beginning ground operations. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden's problems with his party's left flank will be on display in San Francisco this week as progressives use a summit with world leaders to put a spotlight on disagreements with his trade agenda and his administration's approach to the Israel-Hamas war. World leaders are gathering for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC Summit this week, and so too are protestors, pro-Palestinian groups along with anti-capitalists, anti-neoliberal, and other demonstrators are taking to the streets. And organizers with the group No to APEC have vowed to block access to the summit. The largest demonstration is expected to take place tomorrow when Biden and Chinese President, Xi Jinping, are set to meet in the Bay Area.\n\nEven in largely liberal California, 52% of voters say they are unhappy with Biden's performance as president. According to a survey from the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies. And the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war is one of his more polarizing issues. In an Associated Press Newark survey out last week, 50% of Democrats approved of how Biden has navigated the conflict, while 46% disapproved. Far left protesters have increasingly demonstrated over calls for a ceasefire to the conflict and a pro-Israel protest is expected in Washington today when Biden is scheduled to leave for San Francisco.\n\n♦\n\nAmericans are being crushed by the cost of insulin. But bipartisan lawmakers on Capitol Hill are targeting the prices. I spoke with USA Today Congress, Campaigns, and Democracy reporter Rachel Looker to learn more.\n\nRachel, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt.\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo, what did this analysis out today from Senators Raphael Warnock and John Kennedy find about so-called insulin deserts in America?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nSo this really interesting analysis came out today, it's World Diabetes Day, and it found that there are 813 counties throughout the United States that are designated as this term that they're calling insulin deserts. So insulin deserts are pretty much counties across the country that have both high uninsured rates and a high prevalence of diabetes. So this analysis found that most of these counties that have insulin deserts are located predominantly in the south and the southeastern parts of the United States.\n\nSpecifically in these areas, there's less likely to be college graduates, it's more challenging for people who live there to have high speed internet access, there's more likely to be people of color. And all of these factors make it even more difficult for people who need insulin to navigate the programs to be able to obtain this drug that they need to survive. And this analysis is really all in response to a significant increase in the cost of insulin. The analysis cited this report that found over a five-year time span, the list price of certain types of insulin increased to more than $500 per unit, that's up more than 50%.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. And I want to just hear a little bit more about how difficult it is for so many Americans to access insulin. You talked with one such person, Lacey McGee. What did she say, Rachel, about her experiences?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nShe lives in Georgia and has an absolutely heartbreaking story. Lacey was diagnosed with diabetes when she was 17 years old and at the time, she qualified for state Medicaid, which she was able to stay on until she was about 21. And leading up to that point, she knew that she would lose this coverage. So her doctor started prescribing her extra supplies that she would keep and try to ration as best as she could. And when she finally lost that state Medicaid coverage, she opened up the fridge, counted what she had left, and it was a two-year supply, but most of it at that point had expired.\n\nSo Lacey really turned to doing anything and everything she could to get insulin. She would rely on friends who had loved ones pass away and would share the insulin supplies of their deceased family members with her. Some of her friends who were in nursing school would sneak her used vials from the hospital. She even turned to Facebook groups where she would meet people and pay them to either mail her insulin or meet up with them in Chick-fil-A and grocery store parking lots to get supplies. And she has a full-time job now and she has insurance, but she still lives in constant fear of losing it and what that could mean for how she can get the insulin that she needs to survive.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA heartbreaking story. So, this proposed bill introduced by Senator Warnock, the Affordable Insulin Now Act, what would it do for insulin prices and access?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThe legislation would cap insulin products at $35 per month under private insurance plans. And this would help an estimated 2.5 million Americans who have private insurance and use insulin. The legislation also would create a new program through the Department of Health and Human Services for uninsured Americans to access insulin for no more than $35 per month. And it would reimburse insulin providers for any costs above $35.\n\nAnd all of this builds off of previous efforts. In 2022, a provision of one of his bills looking at this issue was included in the Inflation Reduction Act and that capped insulin at $35 for seniors and Medicare recipients.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSenator Warnock has said that there's a bipartisan path to get this done. What does that path really look like, Rachel?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nRight now, the legislation has six Republican co-sponsors. Some of them include Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, and Alabama Senator Katie Britt. So Senator Warnock feels that with the bipartisan support, there would be a path forward for this legislation.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Rachel Looker, great insight as always. Thank you so much, Rachel.\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThank you so much for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA Colorado hiker who was missing for months was found dead late last month, but his 14-year-old Jack Russell Terrier was found alive waiting by his side. A hunter found the body of 71-year-old Rich Moore last month after he and his dog named Finney were reported missing on August 19th in a rugged area near the Colorado-New Mexico border. Authorities carried out an extensive search of the area, spending almost 2,000 hours looking. Moore's cause of death is currently unknown. It's not clear how Finney survived her time in the wilderness, but she's since been reunited with her family after she was examined and treated at a local animal hospital.\n\n♦\n\nThanks for listening to The Excerpt.

DeVillers retired from the U.S. attorney's office last month.\n\n\"BGSU will complete a thorough and fair investigation, seeking the truth and facts, and holding all students and groups responsible,\" Bowling Green State University President Rodney K.

He died two days later when he was taken off life support. BGSU officials have since stripped the fraternity of its status as a student organization.\n\nStone Foltz:What we know about the BGSU student who died after an alleged fraternity hazing incident\n\nSean Alto, an attorney representing the Foltz family, said Foltz was at an off-campus event organized by the fraternity where he was given \"a copious amount of alcohol.\"\n\nFoltz was dropped off that night at his apartment by members of the fraternity, known as PIKE, where he was later found by his roommates, Alto said. The roommates called 911 and Foltz was transported to a hospital in \"dire\" condition, according to Alto.\n\nFraternity hazing: So far, fraternity hazing deaths haven't changed Ohio law. Will BGSU, Stone Foltz be different?\n\nSince the incident, Bowling Green is assisting local law enforcement to investigate Foltz's death and is conducting its own student code of conduct investigation, Rogers said. The president also will host roundtable discussions with students focusing on the university's anti-hazing efforts.\n\nBowling Green is also planning to partner with Dyad Strategies, a Florida-based higher education consulting firm, to conduct a review of fraternities, sororities and other student organization.\n\n\"BGSU also recognizes that hazing may not be limited to this single incident or group,\" Rogers said. \"BGSU's goal is to get a clearer understanding of student life culture, and this external group will provide their report, which will be shared with the community. The University is committed to keeping our community updated regarding this collective process.\"\n\nDays following Foltz's death, state and national lawmakers introduced anti-hazing legislation.\n\nState Sens. Stephanie Kunze, a Hilliard Republican, and Theresa Gavarone, a Bowling Green Republican, introduced Senate Bill 126, also known as Collin's Law, in the Ohio Senate on March 10.

The preliminary report says overlooked allegations of violence reached all the way to the top, including accusations involving a former university president and a senior administrator.\n\nSurvivors filed a lawsuit in 2021 against Liberty, saying it had ignored their reports while enforcing a code of conduct known as the Liberty Way. A dozen women settled with the the Lynchburg, Virginia, university the following year in an agreement that remains private.\n\nThe Education Department’s investigation had been reported before. It centers on whether the university compiled with the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to report crime that occurs on their campus. However, the May report contains new details about the university’s attempts to cover its tracks.\n\nEducation Department investigators, for example, discovered that “senior officials in HR sought the assistance of IT staff to wipe certain computer hard drives on April 26, 2022, the very week that the review team first visited the campus.”\n\nThat finding is based on interviews with a former dean at Liberty and IT staffer, and it occurred hours after investigators spoke to the university’s executive vice president of human resources about “the importance of maintaining records.”\n\n“It does not appear that any institution-wide record retention program has ever existed at Liberty with respect to its campus security operations, although some individual officers did establish their own guidelines for their operations,” the report read. “Similarly, the university has been unable to provide the basic documentation to substantiate the accuracy and completeness of the university’s campus crime statistics.”\n\nInvestigators also referenced a 2016 incident in which a Liberty Police officer noted “stacks of incident reports laying on tables in an unsecured room.” That person later learned the records were to be “shredded.” The officer reported the incident to the “LUPD headquarters,” but a supervisor eventually told the officer to “return to service.” It’s unclear whether the documents were shredded.\n\nFor its part, Liberty University said in a statement that it has improved its process for complying with the federal government’s requirements. The institution also said it had responded to the government’s initial report by “detailing significant errors, misstatements, and unsupported conclusions in the Department’s preliminary findings,” the statement read.\n\n“Liberty University remains fully committed to ensuring compliance in this area is met and maintained and understands the purpose of this review process is ultimately in the greater interest of our students, faculty, and staff,” said Liberty President Dondi Costin. “More than that, we recognize the original purpose of the Clery Act is for the health, safety, and overall well-being of our entire University community as we remain steadfast in our mission of Training Champions for Christ.”\n\nThe Education Department didn’t return USA TODAY's request for comment Tuesday but responded on Wednesday, saying the agency doesn't discuss ongoing investigations. Federal law requires the department to keep reports confidential until the government shares the investigation’s outcome with the school. The preliminary report – also reported by The Washington Post – is expected to be followed by final findings, which could include such repercussions for the university as fines and monitoring by the federal government.\n\nIn the report, however, investigators noted: “Multiple victims reported to the review team that they felt that the reporting process at Liberty further complicated an already difficult time in their lives and that they would have been better off if they had not reported these crimes in the first place.”\n\nUSA TODAY spoke to two of the former students who say they were assaulted while students at Liberty University. Sarah Mays and Helen Wood said they were part of the lawsuit but did not settle with the university. They said it was important for them to be able to speak freely about their experience – which typically is not allowed under terms of a settlement – with the hope of improving Liberty in the long term.\n\nThe federal government can issue fines as part of Clery Act investigations, but both survivors questioned how much impact any fine would have on the monied university. Liberty’s endowment was roughly $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2020 and among the largest in the country, according to government data.\n\n“A little fine is not going to make them change their ways,” said Mays, who says she was intimidated into retracting her report of being attacked and raped by multiple men in 2001. “They can make back any amount of money with a snap of fingers.”\n\nLiberty is one of the nation’s most prominent Christian universities and a mainstay among Republican luminaries. Jerry Falwell, a prominent televangelist and conservative figure, started the school in 1971. Based in Virginia, the university owes its recent growth to online students – a combined student body of about 93,000 – and it received about $857 million in federal money for student aid, making it one of the largest recipients of such funding\n\nThe institution’s image as a Christian sanctuary has been challenged in recent years, often by its own leadership. Jerry Falwell Jr., who took over after his father’s death in 2007 and helped shape it into the massive institution it is today, resigned in 2020 after a sex scandal involving him, his wife and another man.\n\nWhat did the Department of Education investigation find?\n\nIn the May report, the Education Department listed 12 findings, which include a lack of administrative capability, inaccurate or inadequate policy disclosures, and a failure to issue timely warnings in connection with the Clery Act.\n\nInvestigators noted, for instance, that police took a report involving an “alleged rape that was committed by a former Liberty president,” but that incident failed to make a daily crime log. The report did not name the president or what came of the investigation. The Post reported that only two presidents were alive when the report was produced: the junior Falwell and John Borek, a member of the board.\n\nBorek did not return requests for comment. But Falwell told USA TODAY that he had never heard of a rape allegation involving a Liberty president while he was at the institution. He said had spoken to Education Department investigators a few months back, but they did not ask him about the rape allegation involving a former president.\n\nFalwell added that he recently learned that Liberty’s general counsel and other administrators, “saw it as their job to keep me from being aware of any reported crimes or accusations of assault.” They reasoned, he said, that he might try to intervene on the behalf of a top student athlete or someone from a prominent family.\n\nInvestigators also found a longtime staffer had been accused repeatedly of harassing Liberty employees, but the campus was never warned about him. In one instance, he allegedly arrived at an employee's home and gave her “medicine” that caused her to fall asleep. When she awoke, that employee was kissing her. Investigators wrote that the employee was eventually demoted for his actions. A year later, though, the employee got a promotion.\n\nLiberty regularly touted itself as the “safest college in Virginia,” the report says, and “issuing emergency notifications would have conflicted with that narrative and called attention to the safety issues that existed on Liberty’s campus.”\n\nInvestigators mentioned a student who played for the football team from 2018 to 2022 and was accused of rape in 2020. That player, investigators wrote, went on to stalk a woman who was a student and university employee repeatedly in 2021 and 2022.\n\n“Despite the football player’s history of sexual violence, there is no evidence that University officials ever considered alerting the campus about the threat to the Liberty campus community,” the report said.\n\nThe department also found Liberty failed to report dozens of criminal offenses from 2016 to 2020 that included incidents of rape, domestic violence and stalking. The federal government added that victims of sexual assault often feared speaking up because of “fear of reprisal.”\n\nLiberty didn’t have the resources to investigate crimes on its campus, according to federal investigators. They noted that the university’s investigative unit was “staffed by a single officer for the majority of the review period with few process controls and minimal oversight.”\n\nWhat is the Liberty Way?\n\nMost universities have policies meant to serve as rough guidelines for how students should behave on campus. These codes of conduct vary but often include prohibitions on hazing, underage drinking and harassment.\n\nSome religious institutions build tenets of their faith into their codes of conduct. Brigham Young University requires that students remain “chaste” outside marriage and abstain from alcohol, tobacco and coffee. And it’s Liberty’s code, known as the Liberty Way, that survivors say fostered an environment in which sexual violence ran unchecked and underreported.\n\nIn 2021, ProPublica documented how women who had been raped faced potential violations of the school’s code of conduct when they reported what happened to them. Some were told they would get into trouble because they had been drinking. Others recalled how university staffers discouraged students from reporting when they were assaulted. The assault, college administrators argued, proved they had had sex before marriage, which was against Liberty’s honor code. Several said college staffers altered or removed evidence tied to their reports.\n\nMays and Wood say they experienced the Liberty Way firsthand. Mays, a student who was Jane Doe 15 in the lawsuit, said she was attacked and raped by multiple men in October 2001 while walking near the campus late at night. Months later, she found out she was pregnant.\n\nShe didn’t immediately report what happened, Mays said, but then one of her attackers stalked her on campus with a knife. At the Liberty Police Department, officers pressured her to file a report about the more recent incident but to leave out that her attacker had a knife. She was then directed to file a report with the Lynchburg Police Department, where she said officers again intimidated her into altering her report.\n\nEventually, Mays withdrew her case altogether.\n\nAs a result, she said the dean of Liberty’s office of women accused her of filing a fraudulent police report. Additionally, because Mays was unmarried and pregnant, she could face expulsion and the loss of her scholarship for violating the Liberty Way.\n\nThe dean, Mays said, offered her space in a program meant for unwed women who were pregnant. That offer came with a four-year scholarship if Mays put her child up for adoption. She declined. Her daughter just celebrated her 21st birthday.\n\nWood said she was raped by a member of her taekwondo team in 2015, but Liberty made it difficult to report the case. She said the university also directed her to the Lynchburg Police Department. If she refused, Wood said she was told the university would use the information she shared with them against her – like the fact that she had been drinking before the attack.\n\nShe decided not to say anything at all.\n\nThe attack disrupted her studies. Rather than continue on campus, Wood opted to take classes online before pausing her education. She is still trying to complete her degree.\n\nFor Wood, there had been little question she would attend Liberty in the first place. Few campuses offered a higher education in the type of religious and cultural environment she wanted. She said she was led to believe it was the type of place where sexual assault didn’t happen. Yet Wood said she would have attended even if she had known the truth.\n\n“It’s not going to hurt the reputation of the school if they were just honest,” she said.\n\nWhat is the Clery Act?\n\nAll universities and schools that receive federal funding are required to publish annual reports of the crimes that occur on their campuses. The law that requires that reporting is known as the Clery Act, named after 19-year-old Jeanne Clery, who was raped and murdered on Lehigh University’s campus in 1985.\n\nThe Education Department’s investigation focused on whether Liberty complied with the Clery Act. It was not a review of the university’s compliance with Title IX, the federal law meant to prevent sex-based discrimination within schools, which is the more common law used in such cases.\n\nThat difference might seem minor, but USA TODAY has found that schools determined to be in violation of Title IX seldom face sanctions even though the government can technically withhold federal funding.\n\nThe Education Department has occasionally fined schools that failed to meet provisions of the Clery Act, including a $2.4 million fine to Pennsylvania State University in connection with Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach convicted of molesting multiple children.\n\nThe largest to date is the $4.5 million penalty Michigan State faced in connection with its handling of sports doctor Larry Nassar and the women he victimized.\n\nMays and Wood remain hopeful the university will change, saying they continue to hold what the institution has been and could be in high regard. Both kept taking classes at Liberty after their attacks, and Mays earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree.\n\nAlthough they said the fine is a good first step, they want to see the Education Department open a Title IX investigation into the university as well.\n\nChris Quintana is an investigative reporter at USA TODAY.

Rapinoe and Lavelle will be on restricted minutes initially, but Ertz will have no limitations. The status of all three U.S. stars has been a question for several weeks now, especially after none of the them played in the USWNT's send-off match two weeks ago. The game might seem like a mismatch − the USWNT is the two-time defending champion while Vietnam is ranked No. 32 in the world and is playing in its first-ever World Cup − and Vietnam's coach likened the U.S. women to \"a mountain.\" But the Americans know better than to take anything for granted.

Though they are not likely to prompt Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues to make immediate changes, they could eventually help loosen up an institution that guards its privacy and autonomy.\n\n\"There have been baby steps taken to make the court more transparent, but it is still in many respects the least transparent branch of the three branches of government,\" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nSame-day audio from court arguments has been released in a few cases, beginning with Bush v. Gore in 2000. Same-day written transcripts have been made available to the public since 2006.\n\nRoberts, who became chief justice in 2005, has argued that the judiciary is the most transparent branch of government. \"Everything we do that has an impact is done in public,\" he said in 2011. \"Our decisions are out there.\"\n\nWhen the court held oral arguments during its recent term on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action, only a few hundred people were able to watch. Many were lawyers, journalists, guests of the court and those who could afford to pay others to hold their place in line.\n\nFor the historic gay marriage cases, the court broke with its normal policy and released audio transcripts later in the day. That was the first time in a year that members of the public didn't have to wait until week's end to hear the justices in action. Before 2010, except in rare cases, they had to wait until the end of the term.\n\nWhen it came time to issue decisions on the term's major cases, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged that live audio be distributed, to no avail. Days later, he and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced legislation calling once again for cameras in the court.\n\nThe high court's approval rating in a recent USA TODAY poll hit 43%, an eight-year low.\n\nUltimately, it won't be poll ratings, public pressure or congressional action that moves the nation's highest court, but the preferences of its nine justices.\n\n\"How do you second-guess a court that's supreme?\" says Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption.\n\nCAMERAS PRESENT CHALLENGES\n\nOver the past quarter-century, the court has moved in fits and starts toward more openness.\n\nTwo pilot programs have inserted cameras into some lower federal courts. The latest three-year pilot, set to conclude next year in 14 district courts, from Florida to Washington and from Massachusetts to Guam, got off to a slow start and has been beset by the refusal of many lawyers and clients to have their civil cases filmed.\n\nNevertheless, no mishaps have been reported when the parties do agree, and the introduction of court-operated cameras has gone smoothly, says Kansas District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who heads a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States that will examine the results.\n\n\"What I'm hearing is that people almost forget the cameras are there. We don't really think about them,\" Robinson says. \"We have now become an institution that makes our records transparent. Why not make our proceedings at the trial level transparent?\"\n\nThe appellate level should be even simpler, advocates argue. Already, the appellate courts in the 2nd and 9th Circuits — covering 12 states from Vermont to Hawaii, including California and New York — permit cameras. At the Supreme Court, oral arguments are a simple, hour-long give-and-take between lawyers and justices.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the justices from remaining opposed to cameras — even those, such as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who voiced support for the idea originally.\n\nCameras \"present all sorts of challenges,\" Roberts said in 2011. He mentioned the potential impact on lawyers and judges — who, he said, \"fall into grandstanding with a couple of hundred people in the courtroom.\"\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy said in New York last month, \"My colleagues and I are not immune from the instinct to grab a headline, and I don't want to think that my colleague asked a question for the benefit of the press. I don't want to introduce that insidious dynamic between myself and my colleagues.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said cameras could give Americans the misimpression that everything depends on the oral arguments, rather than the reams of legal briefs, lower court rulings and historic precedents the justices read and research.\n\n\"The notion that it's a contest between two advocates, and the better one is going to win, is totally, totally false,\" she said.\n\nThe cable network C-SPAN has fought for decades without success to get its cameras into the Supreme Court. At a Senate hearing in 2005, its founder, Brian Lamb, said, \"The judiciary has become the invisible branch of our national government as far as television news coverage is concerned, and increasingly, as far as the public is concerned.\"\n\nBruce Collins, the network's general counsel, says the justices limit the amount of public access they will allow. \"The founding fathers put limits on all the rights, including the right of free speech,\" he says. \"The Constitution is satisfied when you have seats in the courtroom for the general public.\"\n\nBut those seats are hard to come by. The court fits about 400 people, but many of the seats are reserved for members of the Supreme Court bar, friends and family, journalists and others. For the most popular cases, members of the public must wait in long lines for hours or even days. Most of those who do get in can stay only a few minutes before making room for others.\n\nEven the court's marble plaza remains off limits to demonstrators, who must stay on the sidewalk. When a district judge ruled in June that the court's ban on protests there was unconstitutional, the court quickly issued a regulation to replace it.\n\n'WE DO FOLLOW THE RULES'\n\nThe debates and decisions of the court aren't all that interest lawmakers and watchdog groups. They also want increased access to the justices' financial disclosure statements and a more intensive focus on ethical behavior.\n\nFueling those demands are some questionable actions by justices, ranging from speeches at fundraising events to refusals to recuse themselves from cases. Liberal groups cite appearances at quasi-political events by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito as examples. Conservatives mounted an unsuccessful effort to get Kagan to recuse herself from last year's case on President Obama's health care law, citing her prior work as U.S. solicitor general; liberals sought to pressure Justice Clarence Thomas off the case because of his wife's political activities.\n\nThe justices' actions in those and other cases do not require justification. That's because the justices, unlike lower court judges, are not legally bound by a code of conduct.\n\n\"The guidelines contained in the code exist to ensure that the public has faith that judicial decision-making is based solely on the facts and the law, not politics and outside interests,\" Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said upon introducing legislation, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would require the court to adopt a code of ethics.\n\nRoberts and several other justices have said they routinely consult the Code of Conduct for United States Judges without being legally bound by it. Because there is no higher court, any ethics code would have to be self-enforced.\n\nEven though the justices abide by congressional directives — such as by filing annual financial disclosure forms and limiting their outside income and receipt of gifts — it is not clear that Congress even has that power over the court.\n\n\"At the end of the day, no compilation of ethical rules can guarantee integrity,\" Roberts wrote in his 2011 year-end report. \"Judges must exercise both constant vigilance and good judgment to fulfill the obligations they have all taken since the beginning of the Republic.\"\n\nJustices Kennedy and Stephen Breyer made those points to a congressional panel in 2011. Breyer said he consults seven volumes of ethics to decide such matters as when to step aside in a case. Unlike the lower courts, he noted, the Supreme Court has no way to replace a judge who recuses himself.\n\n\"We do follow the rules. They do apply,\" Breyer said. But a battle between the branches over legislation, he said, \"produces heat and not too much light.\"\n\nThat's not good enough for government watchdog groups that wrote to Roberts in June, urging that the justices post their financial disclosure forms online as soon as they are finished. Reporters must request printed copies of those reports from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\n\n\"The justices are on notice that members of Congress, as well as certain organizations, have raised concerns,\" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. \"This is a problem peculiar to the Supreme Court.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/12"}]}

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/asia/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-tokyo-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China suspends cooperation with US on range of issues, sanctions ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry announced new countermeasures against Washington on Friday, including the suspension of climate talks, in response to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, hours after it announced sanctions against the US House speaker.\n\nThe measures include the cancellation of future phone calls and meetings between Chinese and US defense leaders, for which future dates had not been announced, and the cancellation of annual naval meetings under the China-US military maritime consultation mechanism.\n\nChina also suspended cooperation on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a briefing Friday.\n\nIt suspended its anti-drug cooperation with the US, which has already been strained in recent years.

But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.\n\nAs the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.\n\n“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.\n\nLocals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.\n\nBack when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.\n\n“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.\n\nBut now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”\n\n“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nIt may be too early to call it a complete victory, but a collective uproar from people across China against stringent Covid controls has forced a remarkable partial climbdown from one of the world’s most authoritarian governments – and its leader, Xi Jinping.\n\nFollowing protests nationwide, some local Chinese authorities have started to ease Covid restrictions – in what appears to be a shift toward gradual reopening as the country nears entering the fourth year of the pandemic.\n\nSince last week, more than 20 cities, including the major metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Chengdu, scrapped the requirements for negative Covid tests on public transport, if not other public venues. And some residential compounds now allow infected residents with special needs to quarantine at home, instead of being sent to centralized quarantine.\n\n“I feel like everyone’s hard work is paying off,” said a protester who took part in a demonstration in Beijing.\n\nChina’s top health official signaled a change in strategy on Wednesday, by declaring the country’s pandemic controls had entered a “new stage and mission.” Xi later shared his thoughts on the issue with the visiting European Council President, according to an EU official who said the Chinese leader had acknowledged people were frustrated and suggested China was open to relaxing its Covid rules.\n\nIt was an extraordinary contrast to Xi’s ringing endorsement of the “tenacious pursuit” of zero-Covid at the Communist Party Congress in late October – back then, he made no mention of the public anger that had been simmering for months, or the soaring economic and social costs of the policy that he had personally backed.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Xi’s authority seemed all but unassailable. He secured a groundbreaking third term in power, moved politically more moderate leaders into early retirement, and stacked the new leadership with staunch loyalists – including some of the most faithful enforcers of his zero-Covid strategy.\n\nThat image of unquestioned and absolute control was pierced late last month by an explosion of dissent from residents, migrant workers and university students who’d had enough.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a worrying development for the party, in addition to Covid restrictions, many young protesters also directed their anger at Xi’s authoritarian policies, from ever-tightening censorship to all-encompassing ideological controls, which now dictate what they’re allowed to watch, read, listen to and buy in their private lives to an extent unseen in decades.\n\nSome demanded greater political freedoms, others decried dictatorship and life-long rule, but the boldest political defiance came from Shanghai, China’s largest city and financial hub, where crowds openly called for Xi to “step down” for two consecutive nights.\n\nProtesters shout slogans against China's strict zero-Covid measures on November 28, 2022 in Beijing. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile China’s security forces moved swiftly to snuff out the demonstrations, the growing calls for political change – unheard of on such a scale since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests – have likely pushed authorities to speed up the easing of restrictions.\n\nState media has carefully avoided all mention of the protests, instead framing the policy adjustment as following the science, a development noted by one Beijing resident in a widely circulated – and later censored – Weibo post: “When you talk to him about democracy, he finally talks to you about science.”\n\nHaving stoked pervasive public fear of catching and dying of Covid, Chinese state media is now citing months-old research on the comparative “decreased pathogenicity” of the Omicron variant. Some state media outlets also shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid – a sharp contrast to previous coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe about-face in public messaging is not lost on many Chinese people critical of zero-Covid. Some shared juxtaposed screenshots of two reports from the state-run People’s Daily published five months apart – one highlighting the severity of long Covid, and one with the headline: “At present, there is no evidence showing long Covid exists.”\n\nDespite the partial relaxation, many restrictions remain in place – and in some parts of the country, new lockdowns and travel restrictions are still being imposed.\n\n“It appears that moving away from zero-Covid is pretty much a decentralized process in China: while some localities are easing restrictions, some allegedly still cling to zero-Covid, and still others are waiting and watching,” wrote Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “Policy flip-flop is common.”\n\nIn some cities, the partial relaxation has caused confusion and chaos on the ground. In Beijing, public venues such as shopping malls and office buildings still require a 48-hour negative Covid test for entry. The abrupt removal of testing kiosks in the capital has also caused long lines at the remaining testing locations.\n\nStill, residents across major Chinese cities shared photos of testing booths being removed from the streets, celebrating what some saw as the “beginning of the end” to zero-Covid.\n\nOthers are in no mood for celebration, citing the livelihood ruined and lives lost due to the draconian lockdowns.\n\n“There will be no compensations, no apologies, no discovery of the truth, just moving on. What can lock us down can also easily unlock us. How terrifying is this capricious power, and when will it overturn your life again?

Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/middleeast/iran-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-execution-intl/index.html", "title": "Iranian footballer Amir Nasr-Azadani is among dozens facing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nShahid Alikhani square is a nondescript part of the historic Iranian city of Isfahan. Its sole claim to prominence is the grand entrance to one of the city’s main metro stations.\n\nBut now it has become a place of pilgrimage for supporters of the high-profile Iranian footballer Amir Nasr-Azadani who fear the young man could be executed in the square, where an execution platform has been installed, a witness close to Nasr-Azadani in Iran told CNN.\n\nTerrified Iranian families believe that while the Western world is preoccupied with Christmas celebrations, a wave of executions in the country is imminent following the recent protests that have swept the country following the death in September of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by Iran’s notorious morality police for being accused of improperly wearing her hijab.\n\nIn collaboration with the activist group 1500Tasvir, CNN has verified documents, video, witness testimony and statements from inside the country which suggest that at least 43 people, including Nasr-Azadani, could face imminent execution.\n\nAuthorities have already executed at least two people in connection with protests in Iran last month, one of whom was hanged publicly.\n\nWitness testimonies and official documents, reviewed by CNN and 1500Tasvir, provide evidence that suggests a rushed judicial process in Iran; charges which could carry the death sentence, often handed down in a single sitting.\n\nNasr-Azadani is accused of involvement in the killing of three security officers, including two volunteer Basij militia members, during protests in Isfahan on November 16, Iranian state media IRNA reported last week.\n\nAccording to state media, the city’s chief justice, Asadullah Jafari, said Nasr-Azadani had been charged with Baghi – or rioting against authorities. Under Iran’s penal code, the sentence carries the death penalty.\n\nSince then, a witness to his arrest said they hoped Nasr-Azadani would be freed, but nevertheless visited Shahid Alikhani square daily to see if authorities would show up with the footballer and execute him on the scaffold. “From the day he was arrested, authorities told us he would be released by the end of the week,” the witness tells CNN.\n\nThen the information dried up. Weeks later the witness, who is close to Nasr-Azadani, says authorities told them that the 26-year-old could be hanged at Shahid Alikhani square.\n\n“The thought that they could execute him any day is really very hard for us … and the daily news we keep hearing is worrisome.”\n\nNasr-Azadani’s family was initially unaware of the reason for his arrest, the witness tells CNN, and officials would not share information of his condition. Those close to him were also warned to “keep quiet” about his case if they wanted to see him released sooner, the witness tells CNN.\n\nThe court last week said it obtained “video and sufficient documentation that prove he [Nasr-Azadani] is part of an armed group” and that the footballer had confessed to his crimes, state media IRNA reported.\n\n‘I really fear they will execute Majid’\n\nPrevious CNN investigations have found prisoners have been subjected to torture and sexual assault. Human rights groups say torture-tainted “confessions” have been used against the defendants in sham trials.\n\nIranian officials have defended the trials nevertheless. In recent days, one Iranian MP said he believes that those involved in the current unrest must be executed within 5 to 10 days after their arrest. CNN received no official response from Iranian officials to its request for comment.\n\nAnother man, Majid Kazemi, was also accused of involvement in the killing of three security forces in Isfahan, the document obtained by CNN and 1500Tasvir shows. Kazemi told others he was coerced into confessing his involvement in criminal acts during his interrogation.\n\nProtests have swept the country following the death of Mahsa Amini in September. Iran Wire\n\n“He did not confess to having done any of the things he was charged with, and so they beat him up severely,” a source close to Kazemi tells CNN.\n\nA released prisoner from the facility where Majid is being kept told the source his arm, leg and nose were broken.\n\nMajid’s court session is set to take place during the holiday season, the source tells CNN.\n\n“This will coincide with a time in which the international community is observing these holy days, and the Islamic Republic regime will take advantage of being removed from the watchful eyes of the world.\n\n“I really fear they will execute Majid.”\n\nIn a recording from inside a Tehran prison, inmate Sahand Noor Mahammadzade speaks about how he was coerced into confession.\n\n“The judge that was there told me to say that I do not protest (object) and gave me three pages that I signed, while they didn’t even allow me to read any of them.\n\n“The second time they took me in for interrogation, my charges had completely changed. That second charge levied against me contained the term ‘moharabe.’”\n\n“They told me to go into the prosecutor’s office and upon entering he said: ‘It is evident from his face. Execute this one!’”\n\nIn a hastily photographed document from inside Isfahan regional court obtained and verified by 1500Tasvir and CNN, it is revealed that at least 10 people in Isfahan have also been charged with Moharabe (a war against God), spreading corruption on Earth and other charges – all of which carry the death penalty.\n\nThe charge, introduced after the 1979 revolution, is regularly imposed against people who are accused of committing acts against the government.\n\nSeveral other witness testimonies and official documents sent by families, and jointly authenticated by CNN and 1500Tasvir, paint a picture that shows how the Iranian regime is rushing the judicial process.\n\nFamilies and activists say only court-appointed lawyers are allowed to represent defendants who are also refused the right to appeal.\n\nIranian-Kurdish Karate champion Mohammad Mehdi Karami is facing execution. His parents made a public plea for the order to be lifted. 1500Tasvir\n\nAnd if the charge is handed down, the Iranian penal code states they could get the death sentence in a single sitting – though not carried out immediately and most sentences are appealed.\n\nSoheil Jahangiri is one of the Iranians to receive such a sentence. Members of his family told CNN they haven’t heard from him in over a month. They say officials did not permit Jahangiri an independent attorney.\n\n“Judiciary officials have alluded to two charges: Baghi and Moharabe. Soheil could face either of these charges that carry the death penalty,” a family member said.\n\n“We are quite frightened that, with the beginning of the Christmas holidays and a decrease in political pressure on the government, executions will begin anew, and I think that Soheil’s life and the lives of numerous political prisoners are in danger.\n\n“We don’t want to see our kids executed while the media is silent,” they added.\n\nA bitter end\n\nCNN has verified that dozens of others – some of them teenagers – face similar charges in connection with the protests and are at risk of execution.\n\nIn the regional court of Khuzestan, west of Isfahan, CNN has confirmed – in conjunction with 1500Tasvir – through court documents that 23 people have been charged with crimes punishable by death.\n\nIn Karaj, near Tehran, CNN and 1500Tasvir have confirmed five more Iranians are facing execution. Among them is 21-year-old Iranian-Kurdish Karate champion Mohammad Mehdi Karami, whose parents have also gone public with their plea.\n\n“Please, I beg of you to please lift the execution order from my son’s file,” his father says in a video shared to social media.\n\nIn messages shared with CNN his family says Karami was not only sentenced to death, he was tortured in prison.\n\nIn another message shared with CNN, they said that despite his alleged ill-treatment, Karami was in good spirits but “physically damaged” having suffered torture.\n\nFor those awaiting execution, the wait behind bars can be unbearable. Just this week, 27-year-old Iranian-Kurdish rapper Saman Yasin attempted suicide while in detention.\n\nIn his last music video, Yasin rapped about inequality and oppression in Iran, singing “they closed my throat violently. They banned beauty. They reversed me like an animal. I am not satisfied with silence.”\n\nJust two days ago Yasin tried to end his life, after weeks of enduring the harsh prison conditions in northern Iran, sources in the prison told CNN.\n\nThe mother of brothers Farzad and Farhad Tahazade makes a plea to save her sons. 1500Tasvir\n\nCNN has verified that at least 43 detainees are facing execution. Statements from both Iranian officials and in Iranian media reviewed by CNN and 1500Tasvir, mention the names of those charged and show that the real number is possibly as high as 100. Many of the families, though, were too scared to speak to us directly to confirm the names mentioned in the media.\n\nAs the year approaches its bitter end, for many Iranians their desperate pleas linger on.\n\nIn a video made public and shared with CNN, the mother of brothers Farzad and Farhad Tahazade, aged 23 and 24, sent this message to the world:\n\n“Please hear my sons’ cries for help. My sons are young and they have children awaiting their release. Please save them. For the love of God, save my sons.”\n\nIn Iran, a woman puts herself at great danger by publicly speaking out against authorities on behalf of her children.

He was 96.\n\nThe former chief of the ruling Communist Party and state president died of leukemia and associated multiple organ failure on Wednesday in Shanghai. He is survived by his wife, two sons and two grandchildren.\n\nJiang’s death comes at a particularly sensitive time in China. An unprecedented wave of protests against the country’s unrelenting “zero-Covid” policy erupted across China in recent days, with some demonstrators in Shanghai calling on current leader Xi Jinping to step down. China has a history of people taking to the streets to mourn the deaths of previous leaders, while airing their grievances against incumbent governments.\n\nThe announcement of Jiang’s passing was met with an outpouring of reminiscence on China’s tightly controlled social media, with many mourning the former leader – and a bygone era when China was perceived to be freer and more open to the world.\n\nThe party’s official obituary hailed Jiang as “an outstanding leader” who enjoyed “high prestige” and “a communist fighter that withstood many trials and tests.”\n\n“During the serious political turmoil in China in the spring and summer of 1989, Comrade Jiang Zemin supported and implemented the correct decision of the Party Central Committee to oppose unrest, defend the socialist state power, safeguard the fundamental interests of the people … and effectively maintain the stability of Shanghai,” it read.\n\nWhile meeting the visiting Laotian president on Wednesday, Xi said the country “deeply mourns” Jiang’s death and “will turn grief into strength” in building a modern socialist China, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.\n\nJiang is often credited for successfully integrating China into the international community after the nation was shunned by the West following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nWith him as its top leader, China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong, won the bid to host the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and, perhaps most importantly, joined the World Trade Organization.\n\n“That was probably the key catalyst to the great growth spurts of double-digit growth for a decade or more – because of that integration,” said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, author of a 2005 biography, “The Man Who Changed China: The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin.”\n\n“In terms of the economic trajectory that was set, it’s absolutely clear to me it was established during that time, and it became irreversible toward the end of his term to hold office.”\n\nMany observers, though, also see Jiang’s reign as having sown the seeds of widespread corruption, which remains a lightning rod for massive discontent to this day. He touted the benefit of “everyone making a fortune quietly” amid continued emphasis on one-party rule instead of political reform.\n\nInitially considered a transitional figure, the relatively unknown Jiang was handpicked in 1989 by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to head the party after the bloody military suppression of the pro-democracy movement nationwide that same year led to the ouster of Zhao Ziyang, the previous party chief sympathetic to the protesters.\n\n“Jiang was a contradictory figure and accidental leader,” said Pin Ho, founder and CEO of the Mirror Media Group, an influential New York-based Chinese-language publisher of books and websites on Chinese politics. “He admired and respected Western cultures – but he also had to live within the Chinese political system.”\n\n“He was not prepared to become a well-thought and visionary leader,” he added. “He merely extended Deng’s rule by executing Deng’s policies.”\n\nThose policies focused on economic liberalization and globalization, which led to improving standards of living as well as a widening wealth gap, while maintaining the party’s iron grip over political, ideological and military affairs in the world’s most populous nation.\n\nChinese leader Jiang Zemin shakes hands with Prince Charles at the handover ceremony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Reuters\n\nShrewd politician\n\nA former party chief and mayor of Shanghai, China’s largest city, Jiang nevertheless proved to be a much shrewder politician than many had predicted, outmaneuvering a myriad of political rivals and consolidating power in the party and military in a few years, especially after Deng’s death in 1997. Installing key allies and protégés throughout the party and government, he headed the so-called “Shanghai clique,” whose influence outlasted his time in office.\n\nIn a telling sign of Jiang’s relative openness and flexibility, he welcomed private business owners – effectively capitalists – into the Communist Party with open arms. In 2001, a year before he stepped down as leader, Jiang declared the party would formally accept entrepreneurs as its members, a significant move that reinvigorated the party and boosted China’s thriving private sector.\n\nHis rule was also marked by the government’s ruthless crackdown on the Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that Beijing branded an evil cult. The group’s hardcore followers had sought Jiang’s arrest for “crimes against humanity” around the world, often dogging the Chinese leader during his overseas visits.\n\nStarting in late 2002, Jiang handed over titles to his successor, Hu Jintao, first as the party boss and then as president. But he clung to his military chief post until 2005 and, even after his official retirement, continued to exert political influence from behind the scenes, including over the leadership selection of Xi – who recently assumed a precedent-breaking third term, paving the way for him to rule for life.\n\nXi, the most powerful leader of the People’s Republic since its founder Mao Zedong, has eviscerated political rivals that included Jiang’s faction. He has also reasserted the ruling Communist Party’s dominance in every aspect of Chinese society, rolling back much of the economic and personal freedoms seen in the days of Deng, Jiang and Hu.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping talks to former leader Jiang Zemin during the Communist Party National Congress in Beijing on October 24, 2017.

He reportedly joined the party while in college and studied in the former Soviet Union in the 1950s. Rising gradually through the party ranks, he became the minister of electronics industry in 1983 before being named the mayor of Shanghai two years later.\n\nFamous for wearing heavy, black-rimmed glasses, Jiang also was known for his fondness for showing off his language and artistic skills – reciting Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address in English and singing “O Sole Mio” in Italian in front of foreign dignitaries.\n\n“I feel that no matter what one’s profession, if one can enjoy reading some literature, enjoy some music, that can be very helpful to the healthy growth of the person,” Jiang told CNN in a one-on-one interview in May 1997.\n\nChinese leader Jiang Zemin smiles during a meeting with executives at the Fortune Global Forum in Hong Kong on May 8, 2001. Reuters\n\nJiang’s flamboyant personality and cosmopolitan flair, while sometimes ridiculed during his rule, brought him unexpected online popularity in recent years as Chinese social media users increasingly reminisce about a comparatively more relaxed political and social atmosphere under his leadership.\n\nMany often point to his surprising decision in 1997 to approve the live broadcast on national television of a joint news conference with Bill Clinton, during which he engaged in a heated debate with the visiting US President on the issue of human rights in China.\n\n“I think he was underestimated during his lifetime,” said Orville Schell, a leading US scholar on China. “Compared to Hu and Xi, he was very voluble and open and friendly.\n\n“He was one of the few Chinese leaders who wanted to be a normal world leader, not a communist dictator.”", "authors": ["Steven Jiang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-xi-eu-meeting-covid-protests-intl/index.html", "title": "China's Xi acknowledges Covid frustration caused protests and hints ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has acknowledged the frustration within China amid his government’s unrelenting zero-Covid strategy, a European Union official told CNN, in his first known remarks on the protests that have erupted across the country in recent days.\n\nXi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel in Beijing on Thursday that the protesters were “mainly students” who were frustrated after three years of Covid, and hinted at the potential relaxation of China’s prevention measures, an EU official told CNN Friday.\n\n“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official said.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing European professional norms.\n\nHowever, the official could not confirm if Xi uttered the word “protest” in Mandarin, or say what wording exactly was used by the Chinese leader to describe the recent unrest over the restrictions.\n\nRare demonstrations have rocked China in recent days as the country approaches the end of a third year of severe controls on civilian life.\n\nThe latest wave of demonstrations is unprecedented since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989. Since Xi came to power in 2012, the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nXi’s remarks come as some areas in China are showing indications they will loosen some Covid restrictions, including lifting lockdowns and allowing some Covid patients to quarantine at home, following widespread anti-lockdown protests across the country.\n\nForeign officials have noted Beijing’s shift on pandemic restrictions. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Friday that the widespread protests in China “had an effect” in loosening some Covid rules.\n\nSpeaking at an event at American University, Sherman noted that the protests had died down, and said part of the reason why is because “they actually had an effect,” citing the example of China letting people quarantine at home.\n\n“At the same time, I’m not naïve, and the Chinese used their security forces to put the protests down,” she added.\n\n“So this is not an all good news story,” Sherman said. “But protests do matter.”\n\nResidents line up for Covid-19 testing at a residential complex in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1, 2022.

Whelan’s release could not be secured in the latest prisoner swap, while Reed returned to the US in April after a nearly three-year ordeal.\n\nThe Biden administration will continue negotiating with Russia to secure Whelan’s release, it said Friday. Russians “have things they want in this world,” and Moscow knows ultimately the two sides will reach “a mutually acceptable arrangement if they keep talking to us,” a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said Thursday.\n\nThe final deal came together over 48 hours, senior US administration officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence. Biden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBout has returned to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nGriner’s family thanked Biden and his administration Thursday in a statement, as well as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, whose Richardson Center worked on behalf of the family to help secure Griner’s release. They also expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public support they’ve received.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers – including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the statement said.\n\n“We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\n‘We will never give up’ on Whelan, Biden says\n\nAs Griner’s return is heralded as a diplomatic achievement, officials and supporters have expressed disappointment Whelan also couldn’t come home.\n\nA US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, Whelan was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. The US State Department has declared him wrongfully detained.\n\nRussia has handled Whelan’s and Griner’s cases differently based on what each has been accused of, it has said, and signaled recently it only would negotiate over Griner, even as the Biden administration made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal.\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said Thursday. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nWhelan was happy Griner was released but “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release, he told CNN Thursday by phone from a penal colony in a remote part of Russia.\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” to try with the Russians to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday. There is a recognition the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered thus far, the official said, not ruling out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said.\n\nWhelan’s family was happy Griner was headed home but “devastated” he was left behind, they said Thursday. The Biden administration told Whelan’s family of her release ahead of the Griner announcement, Paul’s brother David Whelan told CNN.\n\nScenes from Griner’s time in Russia released\n\nGlimpses of Griner’s time in Russian custody emerged Friday via video released by RIA News Telegram.\n\nA small card bearing Griner’s photo is zip-tied to a white metal bed frame in a what appears to be a bunk room, an undated video shows. There is no location given. The bed is covered by white sheets, one with a deep blue stripe, and is among five beds seen in the room with pink walls and sheer white curtains along four windows.\n\nIn another clip, Griner wears a short haircut – without her now-famous dreadlocks – while pushing along a food line a tray bearing two dishes, apparently from among dozens of small plates and bowls seen on open serving shelves. Griner then sits next to a woman at a small square table, raising a utensil to her mouth, a still image shows.\n\nNext, in a different, bright room, Griner wears a dark headscarf while sitting across from a woman and writing with a pen on paper, the RIA News Telegram reel shows. Again in a headscarf, the US basketball star in another frame holds a phone and, after an exchange with a woman, raises her head and smiles.\n\nIn a final outdoor scene, Griner leans over a table to write on a paper while a woman wearing a hat with earflaps speaks, the video shows.\n\nGriner’s Russian lawyer said she had cut her hair while in a penal colony to make life easier during the Russian winter. Maria Blagovolina, partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan and Dyakin, told ESPN – and confirmed to CNN – Griner had cut her hair nearly two weeks ago upon arrival at the prison. Griner had told her attorneys when she washed her hair she would get cold and would get a chill, Blagovolina said.\n\nMost of the women in the penal colony worked during the day sewing uniforms, but Griner was unable to sit at a work table due to her height (she is 6-feet-9) and her hands were too large to manage the sewing. Instead, Griner carried fabric all day, her attorney said.\n\nPhoenix Mercury owner hopes players won’t ‘have to go overseas’\n\nGriner plays for the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA and is a six-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the year.\n\nFor years, she played in the offseason for a Russian women’s basketball team, until she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February.\n\nGriner testified she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage. She was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nOn Friday, Phoenix Mercury President Vince Kozar addressed the issue of whether players should continue playing in certain countries during the WNBA offseason.\n\n“The players have incredible agency with how they choose to make their livings and where they choose to play,” he said on CNN. “It’s fair to say that a lot of players, you know, have to consider their safety when they look at where they go to make their living overseas.”\n\n“My goal is for no players to have to go overseas,” he said. “My goal is for players to be able to play here in the WNBA and make their living, and that’s what we here in Phoenix and 11 markets around the country are working for.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Tina Burnside Rosalina Nieves Rosa Flores", "Travis Caldwell", "Tina Burnside", "Rosalina Nieves", "Rosa Flores"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}]}

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/uk/boris-johnson-replacement-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Conservative leadership race: Who might replace Boris Johnson as ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe race to replace British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ramping up, with 11 candidates declaring their intention to run, many on platforms of lowering taxes and promises to clean up government following Johnson’s crisis-plagued leadership.\n\nSir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative party backbenchers announced on Monday that a new leader would be announced on September 5, the same day that the British parliament returns from its summer recess. He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Rishi Sunak, rich ex-banker who will be ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nJust seven short weeks ago, it looked as if it might be all over for Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer – the UK’s title for its chief finance minister – made a high-stakes gamble. He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/abortion-rights-2022-midterms/index.html", "title": "Abortion rights were on the ballot in these states. Here's what voters ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nVoters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nSeveral states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.\n\nAbout 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.\n\nWhile CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.\n\nHere’s a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.\n\nMontana rejects abortion measure that would allow criminal penalties on health care providers\n\nVoters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.\n\nLR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant “born alive” – defined as an infant “at any stage of development” who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction – be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.\n\nA health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report “a failure to comply with the requirements” to law enforcement.\n\nMontana currently prohibits abortions past viability – “the ability of a fetus to live outside the mother’s womb” – except to save the life or health of the woman.\n\nLast year, the state’s Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.\n\nBackers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasn’t needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.\n\nHillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 “zeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.”\n\n“It’s not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony,” she previously told CNN.\n\nKentucky rejects proposal that would have further restricted abortion rights\n\nKentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.\n\nThe ballot question voters faced read: “Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?”\n\nKentucky’s “trigger law,” which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.\n\nKentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting “yes” would “ensure there’s no false interpretation of the constitution.”\n\nWithout the amendment, “instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people’s will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,” Wuchner said.\n\nTamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would “open the door to more attacks on abortion access,” but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to “continue to fight back” against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.\n\nIf adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.\n\nMichigan enshrines abortion rights\n\nMichigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.\n\nThe passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an “individual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.”\n\nMichigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts. The passage of the ballot proposal helps prevent the ban from taking effect.\n\nThe amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patient’s life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in “exercising rights established by this amendment.”\n\nThe proposal had to overcome legal challenges to be included on the ballot, with the Michigan Supreme Court ordering officials in September to include the question on ballots in a 5-2 ruling.\n\n“We are energized and motivated now more than ever to restore the protections that were lost under Roe,” Darci McConnell, a spokesperson for Reproductive Freedom for All, a group backing the effort, said in a statement after the ruling.\n\nMichigan Republicans had blasted the court’s decision, along with another on a voting rights ballot proposal. “Despite the court ruling, these measures remain too extreme for Michigan, and we are certain they will be handily defeated at the ballot box in November,” Elizabeth Giannone, deputy communications director for the state party, predicted in a statement earlier this year.\n\nCalifornia voters put abortion rights in state constitution\n\nThe California Constitution will protect the right to an abortion after residents on Tuesday passed a ballot initiative to enshrine the right in the state’s governing document, CNN projects.\n\nCurrently, the state constitution guarantees a right to privacy, which the California Supreme Court has ruled includes the right to have an abortion.\n\nIn May, following the leak of the US Supreme Court’s draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, California Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement that they would propose an amendment “so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state.”\n\nThe Democratic-controlled state legislature in June approved putting the amendment on the November ballot.\n\n“Proposition 1 ensures that no matter what the future legislature looks like, what the future governor looks like, that people in California have a constitutional protection that explicitly ensures the state won’t interfere with their right to reproductive freedom,” Jodi Hicks, the head of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop 1 campaign, previously told CNN.\n\nThe California Family Council had said the proposed amendment is an “extreme and costly proposal that does nothing to advance women’s health.” And the California Catholic Conference, which opposes Proposition 1, called it a “misleading ballot measure that allows unlimited late-term abortions – for any reason, at any time, even moments before birth, paid for by tax dollars.”\n\nThe Yes on Prop 1 campaign previously said the proposal would not change “existing state constitutional protections and law, which provide for the right to choose an abortion prior to viability or to protect the pregnant person’s life or health.”\n\nThe measure goes into effect the fifth day after the vote is certified.\n\nVermont voters back abortion rights\n\nVoters in Vermont on Tuesday approved an amendment to the state’s constitution that abortion rights supporters say will protect “every person’s right to make their own reproductive decisions,” including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control, CNN projects.\n\nThe Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: “That an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one’s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”\n\nAbortion is currently legal at all stages of pregnancy in Vermont. The proposed amendment was first brought by the Vermont Legislature in 2019.\n\nVermont for Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee, the coalition that backed Article 22, had previously said state-level protections “are vital to safeguarding access” now that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“It would mean that abortion access has been codified in the state constitution, and really the most important part of that is that it’s protected long-term, and it means that access is going to be there, no matter what our politicians do,” Sam Donnelly, the campaign manager for the coalition, previously told CNN.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of Article 22 have said its adoption means that Vermont lawmakers will be unable to pass any limitations or regulations on abortion in the future because it would then be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nMary Beerworth, the executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, which opposes the amendment, had said the proposal goes “way, way further” than codifying abortion rights into the state constitution.\n\n“It will be about a vast range of anything that pertains to your personal reproductive autonomy, from surrogacy, three-parent embryo, designer babies, minors possibly accessing the hormone blockers for transgender surgery without their parents’ knowledge or consent,” she previously told CNN. “It’s opening a whole new world here if it passes.”\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Devan Cole Paul Leblanc", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Devan Cole", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-historic-firsts/index.html", "title": "Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.\n\nHeading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.\n\nHouse Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.\n\nDemocrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices.

I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him.

She also described how Meadows occasionally told staffers to keep some Oval Office meetings “close hold” and potentially omitted from official records.\n\nThere were also additional details about Hutchinson’s dueling loyalties that led her to ultimately switch lawyers and provide damning testimony about what she saw and heard at the White House after the 2020 election.\n\nThe latest cache of transcripts also revealed some of the rumors, gossip and wild conspiracies that were floating around the White House – including conversations about QAnon conspiracies – while then-President Donald Trump refused to concede and tried to overturn the election results.\n\nBurned White House documents and “close hold” Oval Office meetings\n\nMeadows told White House staffers to keep some Oval Office meetings “close hold” during the transition period, potentially leaving meetings off the books, according to Hutchinson, who was a top Meadows aide.\n\nHutchinson also testified that there “were certain things that had potentially been left off” the Oval Office diary.\n\nHutchinson said she recalled Meadows having a meeting at the end of November or early December 2020 in which he told outer Oval Office staffers: “Let’s keep some meetings close hold. We will talk about what that means, but for now we will keep things real tight and private so things don’t start to leak out.”\n\nShe testified that she couldn’t recall whether there was specific information Meadows wanted to keep “close hold.” She said she was not aware of any explicit directions that Meadows gave to keep January 6 information “close hold.”\n\nAdditionally, she told the committee that she saw Meadows burn documents in his office fireplace around a dozen times – about once or twice a week – between December 2020 and mid-January 2021.\n\nOn several occasions, Hutchinson said, she was in Meadows’ office when he threw documents into the fireplace after a meeting. At least twice, the burning came after meetings with GOP Rep. Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, who has been linked to the efforts to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election. The New York Times and Politico have previously reported on Meadows’ alleged document-burning practices.\n\nHutchinson said she did not know what the documents were, whether they were original copies, or whether they were required by law to be preserved.\n\nTug-of-war over Hutchinson’s loyalty\n\nOne of the transcripts released Tuesday was Hutchinson’s final deposition with her initial, Trump-funded lawyer, Stefan Passantino, which was conducted on May 17. She soon hired a new attorney, Jody Hunt, and sat for another deposition on June 20, a transcript of which was also released Tuesday. That was just eight days before she delivered surprise testimony at the January 6 committee’s sixth public hearing.\n\nThe new batch of transcripts show the deepening divide between Hutchinson and Passantino just weeks before she hired hew new lawyer. The two bicker several times, according to the transcript of her May deposition, and Passantino cut off Hutchinson on a few occasions, interrupting her with warnings about her testimony, and sometimes trying to finesse what she said.\n\nTo be sure, Passantino told Hutchinson during the deposition that he was not trying “to shape what you’re saying at all,” according to the transcript. Passantino has denied any wrongdoing and said he represented her “honorably” and “ethically.”\n\nThe May interview began with questions about whether Trump agreed with some rioters’ chants calling for the hanging of then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHutchinson said she did not hear those comments firsthand, but said she did hear Meadows mention those comments to two White House lawyers. Passatino then interrupted the line of questioning, warning Hutchinson not to accidentally divulge privileged legal advice.\n\nShe went on to testify that she overheard Meadows say Trump thought “maybe perhaps the chants were justified.” This detail ended up being one of the most damning things to emerge from her testimony and was featured prominently at the panel’s public hearings.\n\nWhen Hutchinson continued testifying about Trump’s alleged reaction to the chants, Passantino jumped in again.\n\n“I don’t want to interrupt, nor do I want to shape what you’re saying at all here,” he said, before offering a different take on Trump’s reaction to the anti-Pence chants. He told the lawmakers that he believed “the President said perhaps they’re right” as opposed to expressing a clear, affirmative view that Pence should be executed, according to the transcripts.\n\nAfter Hutchinson parted ways with Passantino, her new attorney told the January 6 committee during her June deposition that she needed to clarify and “correct” some of her previous testimony, according to the newly released transcript.\n\nHunt, the new lawyer, told the committee that Hutchinson had things she would like to clarify, to provide context for and “in some respects, to correct” from her previous testimony.\n\n“She wants to be clear about it,” Hunt said, thanking the committee for the opportunity to address Hutchinson’s previous testimony.\n\nHutchinson walked the committee through the transcripts of her first two interviews in order to clarify and elaborate on a number of things she had said.\n\nShe went on to provide a significant amount of new and damning testimony about Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Tapper: Hutchinson's transformation from MAGA supporter to whistleblower is historic 07:05 - Source: CNN\n\nQAnon conspiracy discussions in the White House\n\nHutchinson told the committee about several discussions at the White House involving QAnon conspiracies.\n\nIn her June interview – the fourth she had conducted with the panel – Hutchinson described a discussion about QAnon during a December 2020 meeting with Meadows, then-President Trump and Republican members of Congress, including Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n“I remember Marjorie Taylor Greene bringing QAnon up several times, though, in the presence of the president, privately with Mark,” Hutchinson testified. “I remember Mark having a few conversations, too, about – more specific to QAnon stuff and more about the idea that they had with the election and, you know, not as much pertaining to the planning of the January 6th rally.”\n\nIn her May interview, Hutchinson said she also remembered Greene bringing up QAnon while Trump was in Georgia for a rally on January 4, 2021.\n\n“Ms. Greene came up and began talking to us about QAnon and QAnon going to the rally, and she had a lot of constituents that are QAnon, and they’ll all be there,” Hutchinson said. “And she was showing him pictures of them traveling up to Washington, D.C., for the rally on the 6th.”\n\nHutchinson also testified that Trump aide Peter Navarro would bring her materials about the election to pass along to Meadows. “And at one point I had sarcastically said, ‘Oh, is this from your QAnon friends, Peter?’ Because Peter would talk to me frequently about his QAnon friends,” Hutchinson testified.\n\n“He said, ‘Have you looked into it yet, Cass? I think they point out a lot of good ideas. You really need to read this. Make sure the chief sees it,’” she continued.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the panel’s top Republican, asked Hutchinson whether Navarro was being sarcastic about his QAnon friends.\n\n“I did not take it as sarcasm,” Hutchinson said. “Throughout my tenure working for the chief of staff, he would frequently bring in memos and PowerPoints on various policy proposals that – he would then expand on, you know, ‘Q is saying this.’”\n\nTrump groused about ‘effing Pence’ after January 6, aide told committee\n\nWhite House aide John McEntee told the January 6 committee about Trump’s anger toward Vice President Mike Pence, after Pence resisted Trump’s pressure to overturn his 2020 election defeat.\n\nMcEntee told the panel about a small Oval Office meeting to discuss the vice president’s role in certifying a presidential election. McEntee said he was asked to look into historical precedents, and he later found and circulated some information from the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the vice president.\n\nMcEntee also recalled hearing Trump tell Pence during a separate Oval Office meeting things like, “Michael, do the right thing,” and “do what you think is right, Mike,” according to the transcripts.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Pence refused to go along with the scheme that many of Trump’s advisers believed was unconstitutional. McEntee told the panel that after January 6, he heard Trump speak negatively about Pence.\n\n“Just like, you know, effin’ Pence, or whatever,” McEntee said.\n\nWH aide acknowledges pressing GSA to delay transition\n\nMcEntee was also asked about the transition after the election. He recalled that it was discussed with a group of people, including Meadows, that the person in charge of starting the transition at the General Services Administration needed to delay the start of the transition until they knew “more of what was going on.”\n\n“And I think she did that up until, again, one of these other milestones was reached,” McEntee said.\n\nCNN reported at the time that the White House was pressuring GSA Administrator Emily Murphy not to ascertain the election and begin the transition process after Joe Biden was declared the winner.\n\nMcEntee added that he spoke to Murphy once when she had left Washington and was home during this period to check in on her.\n\nDespite these apparent efforts to influence Murphy, when she finally recognized Biden’s victory and initiated the transition, she said in a letter to the president-elect that “I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official, including those who work at the White House.”\n\nRumors in the White House about a Trump concession\n\nFormer Trump White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere testified to the January 6 committee that he heard “gossip” from his colleagues during the week after the 2020 election that Trump was considering conceding and inviting the Bidens to the White House.\n\n“In the week after the election, there was gossip around the building that he was considering conceding,” he told the panel, according to a transcript of his testimony that was released Tuesday.\n\nDeere said Trump was “even strongly considering inviting the President-elect and the incoming First Lady to the White House.”\n\nHe added, “Being the Deputy Press Secretary in charge of ensuring that the protected press pool always has access to him… I was very inclined to hear more about if the President-elect and the incoming First Lady would be making a visit.”\n\nCongressional investigators pressed Deere to reveal where he heard the rumors, but he said he could not remember. Obviously, Trump did not concede to Biden and instead tried to overturn the election results, leading to the violent storming of the US Capitol on January 6.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb Marshall Cohen Hannah Rabinowitz Geneva Sands Veronica Stracqualursi Kate Sullivan Kristen Holmes", "Jeremy Herb", "Marshall Cohen", "Hannah Rabinowitz", "Geneva Sands", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kate Sullivan", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-liz-truss-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss to succeed Boris Johnson as British prime minister ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series of scandals.\n\nTruss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.\n\nShe pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-democrats-future/index.html", "title": "Nancy Pelosi announces she won't run for leadership post, marking ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will relinquish her leadership post after leading House Democrats for two decades, building a legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics.\n\nPelosi, the first and only woman to serve as speaker, said that she would continue to serve in the House, giving the next generation the opportunity to lead the House Democrats, who will be in the minority next year despite a better-than-expected midterm election performance.\n\n“I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,” said Pelosi in the House chamber. “For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect, and I’m grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.”\n\nPelosi, 82, rose to the top of the House Democratic caucus in 2002, after leading many in her party against a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/politics/midterm-elections-what-to-know-house-senate-control/index.html", "title": "What to know about control of Congress and outstanding votes in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of the House is now the biggest unanswered question of this year’s midterm elections after Democrats kept their narrow Senate majority.\n\nVictories in Arizona and Nevada, according to CNN projections, mean the party will enter 2023 with at least 50 Senate seats – and could add one more if Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a Georgia runoff next month.\n\nBut there are other key races for other offices that are still outstanding.\n\nWhich party reaches the 218 seats necessary for a House majority will hinge on races in states with a large share of mail-in ballots – including California, where identifying winners in some races could take weeks, Oregon and Arizona.\n\nAnother high-profile contest remains too close to call: The Arizona governor’s race – where Republican Kari Lake, the Donald Trump-supported election denier, is facing Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs, a defender of the state’s election process.\n\nA Democratic upset keeps House majority hopes alive\n\nThe political world’s eyes are now on the battle for control of the House, where Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward a narrow majority but Democrats’ hopes have not yet fully faded.\n\nRepublicans have won 211 of the 218 seats they’d need to take the majority, according to CNN projections, while Democrats have won 204, with 20 undecided as of Saturday evening.\n\nDemocrats scored a major coup in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd District, where on Saturday CNN projected that Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez would defeat Republican Joe Kent, who had aligned himself closely with former President Donald Trump.\n\nHer victory came largely as a result of Trump’s efforts to punish Republicans who voted to impeach him. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a moderate who was widely viewed as a lock for reelection, did not finish in one of the top two slots in the primary and therefore didn’t advance to the general election.\n\nMany of the undecided races are in California, where counting mail-in ballots can take weeks and significant shifts can occur late in that process. Other states with large quantities of mail-in ballots, including Arizona and Oregon, also have undecided races.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate makeup of both chambers next year, Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance has prompted a backlash against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nSenate win also boosts Biden’s power\n\nIn retaining their Senate majority, Democrats defied the historical trend of midterm elections breaking against parties in power and overcame anxiety about high inflation. Instead, voters punished Republicans who had opposed abortion rights and parroted Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\nThe outcome is a huge boost to President Joe Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees – avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took a victory lap late Saturday night, saying that voters had vindicated Democrats’ agenda.\n\nHe said the Democratic Senate candidates “beat some very flawed challengers who had no faith in democracy, no fidelity to truth or honor. And even when the polls looked bleak, our candidates never gave up and never lost faith.”\n\nHe also touted Democrats’ ability to block any GOP measures that would ban abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade.\n\n“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there’s now a firewall against a nationwide abortion ban threat that so many Republicans have talked about,” he said.\n\nAnother Georgia Senate runoff\n\nSenate control already being settled will take some of the national spotlight – and the television advertising spending – away from the Senate runoff in Georgia.\n\nBut the December 6 race between Warnock and Walker is still important. A win would give Democrats a meaningful majority, rather than the power-sharing agreement currently in place with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaker in the 50-50 chamber. It would also give them a pad ahead of a 2024 Senate battle in which the party must defend several seats in states that typically back Republican presidential candidates.\n\n“It’s just simply better. The bigger the number the better,” Biden, who is in the midst of an international trip, told reporters in Cambodia shortly after CNN and other news outlets projected Democrats would keep their Senate majority.\n\nWarnock’s campaign had already launched a television advertisement laying out the stakes for the runoff.\n\n“It’s about who has the competence and character to represent us; who’s willing to tell the truth; who has the knowledge needed for the job,” a narrator says in the spot.\n\nIt’s the second straight election in which overtime in Georgia, which is triggered when no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, will be necessary.\n\nIn 2021, Democrats swept two Georgia Senate runoffs – Jon Ossoff’s race against then-Sen. David Perdue and Raphael Warnock’s match-up with then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler had been appointed to the Senate in 2019 when former Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Warnock defeated her in the special election for the remainder of Isakson’s term.\n\nNow, Warnock faces Walker, the former University of Georgia football star backed by Trump, in a race for a full six-year term.\n\nArizona governor among key races still undecided\n\nThe Arizona governor’s race between Lake, one of the most prominent election deniers on the ballot this year, and Hobbs, remains tight, with Hobbs clinging to a 34,000 vote lead as of late Saturday with an estimated 290,000 votes to be counted.\n\nIf she wins, Lake would be a rare Trump-supported election denier to win a competitive statewide race this year. Other Republicans who had parroted Trump’s falsehoods about widespread election frauds lost governor’s races in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and secretary of state races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and more.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Saturday afternoon, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said that about 190,000 votes remain to be counted in Maricopa County.\n\nHe said he was confident that about 95% to 99% of those votes will be recorded by Tuesday. He said the county will continue to report about 85,000 votes per night until they are done.\n\nIt’s perhaps the most closely watched race that’s too close to call. But several other key races are also undecided.\n\nIn Alaska, the state’s at-large House seat and one of its Senate seats will hinge on ranked-choice results. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, who won a special election this summer, is in a strong position to eclipse the 50% mark. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski faces a stiffer challenge from Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who is backed by Trump as part of his bid for retribution against Murkowski and others who for his impeachment after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Rep. Karen Bass on Saturday widened her lead over developer Rick Caruso in the mayor’s race.\n\nElection officials push back on disinformation\n\nOfficials in Arizona and Nevada continued to push back on election misinformation about the vote counting that was spread online by right-wing activists and by Trump on his Truth Social platform. Trump baselessly posted on Truth Social Friday night that Clark County, which is the most populous in Nevada, was “finding all sorts of ballots in Clark County” and “pulling out all stops to steal the Election from Adam Laxalt.”\n\nClark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria refuted Trump’s claim during a news conference on Saturday. In Nevada, ballots postmarked on Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by Saturday.\n\n“We’re taking ballots in that we’re required to take in according to the law, there’s no way that we can find ballots,” Gloria said. “They’re brought here by the United States Postal Service. As long as it’s postmarked [by Election Day], we process those ballots and put them in the count.”\n\nLaxalt struck a different tone than Trump Saturday. Shortly before the Saturday evening ballot drop from Clark County, Laxalt was leading Cortez Masto by a mere 862 votes.\n\nStill, Laxalt acknowledged in a tweet Saturday morning that the mail-in ballots that had arrived over the past couple of days continued to break in higher Democratic margins than his team had calculated. “This has narrowed our victory window,” he tweeted. He said the race was coming down to the more than 20,000 Election Day Clark County drop-off ballots. “If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us.”\n\nUnderscoring the closeness of the race, Laxalt put out a series of tweets Saturday evening encouraging voters to “cure” their ballots to ensure that any ballots with technical errors with signature or other issues could be fixed to ensure they are counted. The deadline to cure ballots is 5 p.m. on Monday.\n\nIn Arizona, where CNN has projected that Sen. Mark Kelly will win reelection, GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters took a different approach – tweeting Saturday that all the votes should be counted before anyone predicts the outcome (even though Kelly continued to lead him by a significant margin).\n\n“For my people who knocked doors in 115 degree heat, and for the million+ Arizonans who put their faith in me, we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted,” Masters tweeted. “If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let’s count the votes.”\n\nMaricopa County Election officials pushed back on Masters’ earlier contention – one that Lake had also made – that the vote counting in Arizona was moving too slowly in Arizona’s most populous county.\n\n“It’s really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” Gates told CNN’s Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.”\n\nGates added that candidates and activists who were stating that the count was taking too long have not been “paying attention to the history of how we have counted votes here in Arizona for decades now. The average time over the last couple of decades to get through our count is 10 to 12 days.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Maeve Reston", "Eric Bradner", "Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/politics/jan-6-capitol-riot-lancaster-republicans/index.html", "title": "How January 6 changed what it means to be a Republican in one ...", "text": "Lancaster, Pa. CNN —\n\nThe day after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, three local Republican officials in Pennsylvania’s Lancaster County announced they were leaving the GOP. Among them was Ethan Demme, a lifelong conservative who had previously served as the youngest Republican Party chairman in this deeply red corner of southeast Pennsylvania.\n\nDisgusted by the denial of the 2020 election and the violence at the Capitol, Demme and his two colleagues sent a joint letter on January 7 to the county GOP chair saying the party they once knew was “gone and has left us behind.”\n\nTwenty miles away, in the northwest corner of the county, Stephen and Danielle Lindemuth had just returned from a daylong bus trip to Washington, where they attended then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally. Rather than turning them off, the events in Washington energized the Lindemuths and sparked a yearlong journey into politics that ended with each being elected to local office.\n\nBoth Stephen, a pastor and substitute teacher, and Danielle, a secretary for the church group that organized the January 6 bus trip, won seats in November on the local school board, despite several local Republican officials endorsing their Democratic opponents. Stephen also won his campaign to be an election judge.\n\nThe story of their path into Republican politics – and Demme’s departure from the GOP – reflects the larger battle raging inside the Republican Party. Over the past year, those who continue to support Trump’s election lies that fueled the violence at the Capitol have solidified their position inside the GOP, while Republicans who remain horrified by the insurrection now find themselves alienated from the party – if not cast out altogether.\n\nThe politics of Lancaster County over the past year shows how Trump’s election lies morphed into anger over a range of issues at the local level, from mask mandates to debates over Critical Race Theory and defunding the police. Interviews with more than 20 Republican and Democratic elected officials, party leaders and activists in Lancaster County reveal how this pattern of political grievance fueled Republican turnout in typically mundane off-year municipal races, reversing Democrats’ electoral gains during Trump’s presidency.\n\n“It just seems there is a through line, that the people who were ‘Stop the Steal’ are also the people who don’t like these government mandates on masks, and then it carries out to the school board,” said Michael Corradino, a dean at a Lancaster County community college who ran as a Democrat to be a township election judge after learning Stephen Lindemuth had no opposition. Lindemuth won handily.\n\nLancaster County is a microcosm of the forces that have reshaped the GOP in the year since January 6. Its collection of mostly Republican-run local townships surround the Democratic-leaning city of Lancaster. The county’s rural, rolling farmland, with a sizable Amish population, is a frequent stop for Republican presidential campaigns and its voters reliably back Republicans for higher office.\n\nEthan Demme, of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, poses for a portrait in his office. Demme left the Republican Party with two of his fellow GOP township supervisors after the January 6 Capitol riot. In June 2021, he launched the Pennsylvania chapter of the Serve America Movement, a third party that's recruiting candidates for statehouse races in 2022. Heather Fulbright/CNN\n\nBut the county is also indicative of the turn the party has taken toward national populism and, in some cases, extremism. Lancaster is 81% White, according to the latest Census data. It’s home to a White nationalist group that launched a political party a little over a year ago, according to local Lancaster newspaper LNP. Of the roughly 60 Pennsylvania residents who face charges for rioting at the Capitol, three are from Lancaster County, including two accused of violence.\n\nThe county is also near the districts of two elected Republicans who were instrumental in helping Trump try to subvert the election – US Rep. Scott Perry and state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who both hail from districts west of Lancaster and participated in Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to support his false claims about election fraud.\n\nAs they have around the country, Democrats in Lancaster County tried to mobilize against what they say is a serious threat to democracy. In the local school board race, the Lindemuths were opposed by two Democrats, Kristy Moore, a teacher, and Sarah Zahn, who runs a local music business. The pair raised tens of thousands of dollars for their campaign, a strikingly large sum for such a small race. And both won the endorsements of local Republican officials turned off by the Lindemuths. They still lost.\n\nLeaving the GOP\n\n“They were just preying on these fears people had that were a threat to what they valued,” Moore said of the Republican message. “Sarah and I tried our best to try to set that record straight: Critical race theory isn’t taught in the Elizabethtown school district. But it just wasn’t enough.”\n\nOn January 6, Demme watched with horror from his home workshop as rioters waving Trump flags and clad in tactical gear swarmed the Capitol.\n\nAt 39, Demme had been involved in Republican politics for more than half his life. He first volunteered for a Republican campaign in Pennsylvania when he was 14. In 2008, he worked on the late-Sen. John McCain’s presidential run. Three years later, at 29, he was chair of the Lancaster County Republican Party and a rising star in local political circles.\n\nDemme soon won a seat on his local township board of supervisors, and in 2016, he launched a bid for the Pennsylvania state Senate. By then, Trump was barnstorming the GOP Presidential primaries. Demme decided early on he was a “never-Trump” Republican, a position that ultimately doomed his state Senate campaign.\n\n“Let’s just say I didn’t win that race,” Demme said with a laugh during a December interview inside a downtown Lancaster hotel. Demme, who is tall with a dark beard and slicked-back hair, wore a sharp gray suit, and made sure to note that the former home of one of his political heroes, Thaddeus Stevens, was just down the street.\n\nStevens, a “radical Republican” abolitionist from the Civil War era, played a role forming the GOP and is buried in Lancaster. During a never-Trump rally Demme helped organize in April 2016 before the primary, they marched from Stevens’ grave to his home.\n\nJust after 5 p.m. on January 6, Demme went online to change his registration to “no affiliation.” He discovered two of his fellow Republican board supervisors in East Lampeter Township felt the same way, and the next day they jointly announced they were leaving the GOP, swinging control of the five-member township board to the new independent wing.\n\n“Most of the feedback I got was very positive, actually that was the most surprising thing,” Demme said. “A lot of it from Republicans, off the record saying, ‘You know, we support you. I wish I could do that, but – there’s always a but – my business, my political career, I make money from.’ There’s a lot of pressures for people to stay in their lane. It’s just sort of the way that the system is set up.”\n\nDemme wasn’t the only Republican official in Lancaster to leave the GOP. Melissa Dye, a former local GOP county committeewoman, says she left the party and politics entirely after January 6. Bob Hollister, a school superintendent in the county, changed his voter registration last spring and says he’s now considering running for Congress as a Democrat against Rep. Lloyd Smucker, a Republican elected in 2016 who voted to object to Pennsylvania’s presidential election results early on January 7.\n\n“I really do think there’s a large group of folks in the middle who really don’t seem to have a voice right now,” Hollister said.\n\nIn 2019, Demme was reelected to the township board without opposition. But after January 6, he was still itching to play a bigger role in the political fights unfolding in Pennsylvania. After mulling what to do with other disaffected Republicans, Demme announced in June he was forming a Pennsylvania chapter of the Serve America Movement, a third party created in 2017 that’s currently chaired by another Republican who left the party, former Florida Rep. David Jolly.\n\nDemme acknowledges the difficult road ahead – and that third party candidates have no track record of success in Pennsylvania.\n\n“When you’re running a third party and you’re trying to recruit candidates for a third party, you have to have a little bit of Don Quixote,” Demme said. “I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t legitimately think that our democracy is actually under attack. And that’s what January 6 showed.”\n\nTraveling south to Washington\n\nBefore dawn on January 6, the local Fox TV station in Lancaster County ran a live broadcast from an Elizabethtown parking lot. Four buses loaded with about 175 people were preparing to leave for Washington to protest Trump’s election loss to Joe Biden, one of numerous bus trips organized across the county and state.\n\nAmong those heading to Washington were Stephen and Danielle Lindemuth. The couple have lived in Elizabethtown, or E-town, as the town in the northwest corner of the county is called, for more than a decade. They have a daughter in the town’s high school. Stephen, 49, is a former pastor and substitute teacher in a neighboring county, while Danielle, 45, works as a secretary for the Christian nonprofit Partnership for Revival, the church group that organized a January 6 bus trip, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nA crowd of Trump supporters as seen from inside the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. Cheriss May/Getty Images\n\nWhen she returned from Washington the night of January 6, Danielle Lindemuth told the Lancaster newspaper that she was near the Capitol when barricades were pushed down, but she stayed outside.\n\n“We went down there because we truly believe this election has been fraudulent, and we do believe the truth needs to be brought out,” she told LNP. “If you’re not going to hear us, you’re going to see us.”\n\nStephen and Danielle Lindemuth did not respond to CNN’s phone and email requests for an interview. There’s no evidence the Lindemuths went into the Capitol, and they haven’t been charged with any crimes related to January 6. Stephen Lindemuth wrote on Facebook three days afterward that a “few weeds” in the crowd on January 6 turned “a very positive event into a negative one.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly how the three Capitol rioters charged with crimes from Lancaster County got to Washington on January 6, at least one may have taken a bus from Elizabethtown, according to the Lancaster newspaper. Two of the defendants, Michael Lopatic and Samuel Lazar, are accused of violent acts against police. Lazar has pleaded not guilty and Lopatic has not yet entered a formal plea. A third, Edward McAlanis, pleaded guilty in November to unlawfully protesting in the Capitol and took a leave of absence from chairing the township’s recreation board after he was charged. McAlanis and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nProtesting ‘tyrants’ at school board meetings\n\nIn the aftermath of the Capitol riot, Danielle Lindemuth continued to promote on social media Trump’s lies that the election was stolen. She attended a rally in April at the state Capitol, posting video from the event organized by a group demanding a “forensic audit” of Pennsylvania’s 2020 election results and spreading the same false conspiracy theories as Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell.\n\nIn Elizabethtown, Danielle and Stephen Lindemuth directed their attention to the local school board. After spending the first few months of the year battling with the board over issues of race and sexuality – complaining during the public comment portion of board meetings about books taught in their daughter’s 9th grade classroom, including “The Hate U Give,” “Romeo and Juliet” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” – the Lindemuths filed to run for two of the board’s four open seats in February.\n\nTheir campaign, backed by a statewide group formed to protest the Democratic governor’s 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns, echoed the national and state-level controversies embraced by Republicans: critical race theory, transgender women participating in women’s sports and “protecting student freedoms” from mask mandates.\n\nStephen and Danielle Lindemuth, of Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, won seats on the Elizabethtown school board in November. Stephen Lindemuth was also elected as a local election judge. The couple, who went to Washington on January 6, though they did not enter the Capitol, campaigned for the school board on issues including opposition toward mask mandates and critical race theory. From Facebook\n\nAfter the school board adopted a “masks optional” policy to begin the school year in August, the state’s Health Department issued a new mandate requiring masks in schools as the Delta variant drove up case numbers. The board said it had no choice but to enforce the state’s mandate – sparking a furious outcry from the Lindemuths and other parents, who argued the state was taking away the freedom to make a decision that should be left up to parents.\n\n“You school board have the right to govern over the school and to push back against the governmental overreach of a governor who is acting as more of a dictator than an elected official,” Danielle Lindemuth said at a September school board meeting, which was moved to a bigger venue to accommodate the rowdy crowd. One man was removed for refusing to wear a mask, forcing the meeting to recess.\n\nThe board’s president, Terry Seiders, told angry parents at the meeting that the district had to comply. “This school board did not issue this order. The district administration did not issue this order, and our principals did not issue this order,” he said. “Sadly, our principals and district staff have been called tyrants, nut jobs, child abusers, to name a few of the adjectives that have been unjustly used in this past week.”\n\nBut many parents called on the board to ignore the state mandate anyway – and chastised the officials for refusing to do so.\n\nApril Kelly, a political scientist at Elizabethtown College, said the reaction to the state’s mask mandate was a prime example of how national and state politics trickled down to the local level.\n\n“We’re attacking public school officials trying to educate children, not because they’re the people responsible but because that’s the level of government that’s vulnerable,” she said. “That’s where our angst gets turned, even if that’s not the appropriate level of government.”\n\n‘It just didn’t sit right’ with Dems\n\nThe Lindemuths’ foray into politics helped spark a group of Democrats to run against them in a town where nearly all elected officials are Republican.\n\nOne of them was Kristy Moore, a 37-year-old mother and public school teacher. Moore had run for school board in Elizabethtown in 2019 as a Democrat and was considering another campaign in 2021. Once she learned the Lindemuths planned to seek two spots on the board, she said there was “no question” she would run again.\n\nSpeaking to CNN at Elizabethtown’s bustling coffee shop in the center of town, where she was one of the few people wearing a mask when she walked in, Moore said that to bolster the Democratic ticket last year she recruited a fellow parent to run alongside her.\n\nSarah Zahn, 42, says that Moore began dropping hints that they should run together in fall 2020 while they petitioned the board to wait on transitioning students into higher-grade schools. Zahn, who has a performing arts background and owns a private vocal music studio, didn’t have any political experience, but she agreed to join forces.\n\nKristy Moore, left, and Sarah Zahn, right, of Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, ran for the local school board as Democrats against a husband-and-wife couple that traveled to Washington on January 6, 2021. Moore and Zahn attracted Republican endorsements but were defeated in the campaign that was heated over mask mandates and critical race theory. Heather Fulbright/CNN\n\nStephen Lindemuth’s bid to be an election judge was also what prompted Michael Corradino, the community college dean, to run for office last year. Election judges in Pennsylvania effectively run a local voting precinct and often no one runs for the job. After reading stories about Stephen Lindemuth’s campaign and attendance at the January 6 rally, Corradino got onto the ballot as a Democratic write-in during the primary to give voters an alternative.\n\n“It just didn’t sit right that somebody associated with January 6 who expressed the viewpoint along ‘Stop the Steal’ is wanting to be a judge of elections,” he said.\n\nThe school board race was easily the most heated contest. The tone of the 2019 and 2021 school board races couldn’t have been more different, Moore said: “In 2019, the incumbents that I ran against, I honestly would have voted for myself.”\n\nThe controversy over the campaign also led to a financial windfall: Moore said she raised less than $1,000 for her first school board race in 2019, enough for some yard signs. In 2021, Moore hauled in about $13,000, while Zahn raised nearly $12,000.\n\nDuring the campaign, Moore said one Elizabethtown resident accused her of being a Marxist. On social media, a woman made a veiled threat toward the two Democrats. “Wish we could take care of traitors like they did back in the day,” the woman wrote on Facebook.\n\nMoore and Zahn took the complaint to the local police department, which looked into the matter but couldn’t take action because it wasn’t a direct threat, Moore said.\n\n“I didn’t expect at all how political this race would get. I think if I’d have known that at the beginning, I would have considered a little bit longer if I wanted to run,” Zahn said. “I wish very much that we could have spent more time talking about property taxes, equity in education for students at all levels, but unfortunately so much energy was put into explaining critical race theory to people.”\n\nCrossing party lines\n\nMoore and Zahn recognized that to have any chance of winning in Elizabethtown, they needed Republican support. So they sought out local GOP officials they thought would be alarmed by the rhetoric from the Lindemuths.\n\nOne of the Republicans they contacted was Jeffrey McCloud. A longtime Elizabethtown resident and former editor of the local weekly paper, McCloud had been an Elizabethtown borough councilman for more than a decade and considers himself a moderate Republican. McCloud was “not a fan” of Trump when he ran in 2016, he said, and he voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nMcCloud was initially hesitant about an an endorsement, concerned about the political ramifications. Once he learned that he wasn’t the only Republican considering crossing party lines, however, he got on board. “Suddenly, there was a whole list of people that I respected in the community, including one of my fellow councilman,” McCloud said.\n\nJeffrey McCloud, of Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, has served as a borough councilman for a decade. He's a self-described moderate Republican, but he chose to endorse two Democrats in the town's school board race last November Heather Fulbright/CNN\n\nCraig Hummer, a Republican on the Elizabethtown school board, said that he endorsed Moore and Zahn because he believed they were the best candidates when it came to supporting public education and the students of the community, even though their politics “couldn’t be further apart.”\n\n“I think it’s healthy for us as a school board to have opposing views on topics,” he said.\n\nThe endorsement letter was signed by 16 current and former local and school officials, a majority of them Republican. “Kristy and Sarah will serve with integrity and common sense, and without a political agenda,” the letter said.\n\nThe politics of January 6 played out in another Lancaster County race in one of the county’s few purple townships. Democrats highlighted a photo of Manheim Township business owner Mary Jo Huyard in Washington on January 6 to try to argue she was too extreme to be a township commissioner. But Huyard and the Republicans retook control of the township board in a razor-thin campaign.\n\n“Wedge issues that the Republicans were pushing from the national level influenced this race, clearly,” said Carol Gifford, one of defeated Democratic incumbents.\n\nHuyard did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA warning for next election\n\nThe campaigns in Elizabethtown also ended in the Republicans’ favor. The school board race was closer after the GOP endorsements, but the four Republican candidates prevailed by more than 700 votes. Stephen Lindemuth easily won his race to be an election judge.\n\nP.D. Gantert, who runs a liberal-leaning political committee in Lancaster County that helps local candidates run for office, said candidates had a harder time swaying voters through traditional door-to-door campaigning because voters’ views were often baked into hardened national opinions.\n\nWhile Democrats made electoral gains in Lancaster County while Trump was president, the surge in GOP turnout in 2021 was a warning sign for the party going into the midterms, said Ismail Smith-Wade-El, Lancaster’s city council president and vice chair of the county Democratic Party.\n\n“Democrats, we were not ready for what happened, and the level of vociferousness and passion and energy and money our opponents would put into hate-driven politics, which ended up winning them elections both locally and nationwide,” Smith-Wade-El said.\n\nMoore and Zahn say they don’t know yet if they’ll run again for school board in two years, but for now, they’re keeping a close eye on the actions taken by the board, which has re-adopted its initial masks-optional policy after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the state’s mandate.\n\nDemme said that as he recruits candidates for the midterms later this year, he’s also weighing his own third-party bid for a statehouse seat. Running would likely pit him against a Republican incumbent.\n\nThe Eastern part of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania is seen in August 2017. Ashley Gilbertson/VII/Redux\n\nFor the Republicans who supported Moore and Zahn in the school board race, it’s too soon to say whether there will be political repercussions. At a November Elizabethtown school board meeting after the 2021 election, one parent warned Hummer that they’d be coming for his seat after he endorsed the Democrats.\n\nMcCloud is also up for reelection in 2023, and he’s aware he could be challenged during the next campaign. But he said he has no regrets, even as he questions whether he still has a home the GOP. He says he might align closest with Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has been ostracized by House Republicans for joining the January 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\n“If in two years, I lose my seat because of this, I can leave office with a clean conscience,” he said. “And I really believe that. I feel really strongly about, about that, and about what has happened to the Republican Party, both nationally and it’s filtered down.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}]}

Awad clarified for the crowd that he was speaking in a personal capacity when he made the electoral threat.\n\n\"No votes for you anywhere if you don’t call for a cease-fire now,\" he said.\n\nAwad's call for an electoral boycott of the Democratic party came one day after progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, released a video making a similar call to action.\n\n“Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people,\" Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, says in the video. \"The American people won’t forget. Biden, support a cease-fire now. Or don’t count on us in 2024.”\n\n'Enough is enough'\n\nSome at the protest, such as Joan Nicholson, 89, of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, were drawn by their longstanding sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Others, like Xochitl Aldama, 25, of Tampa, Florida, said they came to the protest due to their newfound horror at the scale of destruction in Gaza.\n\nOthers were driven by personal loss.\n\n“I came with tens of thousands of others to hold my country accountable for its complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity,” Laila El Haddad, 45, a Palestinian American author, told USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned yesterday that five of my close family members – my aunt, three of my adult cousins, and my cousin’s wife – were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their Gaza City home.”\n\n“I’m here to say enough is enough,” she said.\n\nBig crowd spills beyond Freedom Plaza\n\nBy late Saturday afternoon, it was unclear how many people had participated in the rally. The crowd spilled out of Freedom Plaza and across the adjoining streets.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police said in response to a query that it was “prohibited from providing crowd sizes for any event.” The D.C. Metropolitan Police didn’t respond to calls seeking an estimate of the crowd’s size.\n\nAs the speeches wound down shortly before 5 p.m, a stream of demonstrators two city blocks long left the plaza to march to the White House as Arabic pop music played and participants shared snacks of carrot sticks and crackers. Some marchers carried mock coffins representing the victims of Israeli strikes on Gaza.\n\nThe bulk of the marchers stood outside the White House for about 30 minutes chanting slogans before dispersing.\n\nOne man was arrested for destruction of property during the protest in Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Officer Elizabeth Grannis said. The man is accused of spray painting windows of a business in the 700 block of 17th Street, NW, a police social media post said.\n\nIn a social media post Saturday evening, traffic police said people were gradually dispersing from Lafayette Park, and police are planning to reopen planned road closures.\n\nPolice were still monitoring the protests in front of the White House, Grannis said.\n\nJust before 8 p.m., Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service, told USA TODAY demonstrators remained at the White House complex, but an attempt to trespass at a gate was handled without incident. No arrests had been made by Secret Service personnel, he said.\n\nAnti-Defamation League claims rally had 'zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering'\n\nThe speeches at Freedom Plaza were full of grief over the destruction of Gaza and anger about the war, but no one who took the stage Saturday condemned Hamas or its attack on Israel, Meredith Weisel, capital region director of the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\n\"There was zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering,\" Weisel said in an interview, \"and a lot of legitimizing and justification for violence against Israelis.\"\n\nOne group of demonstrators carried a banner bearing the hashtag #AlAqsaFlood, the name that Hamas gave to its stunning attack last month.\n\n\"Surely there are people there today who are responding to the humanitarian crisis\" in Gaza, Weisel added. \"But most of the people we have have seen on the stage have been justifying what happened on Oct. 7.\"\n\nProtesters in New York, London and Paris demand an end to the Gaza war\n\nOn Saturday evening, images circulated online showed scores of demonstrators marching through Midtown Manhattan streets toward the United Nations building. The New York City Police Department said there were temporary road closures because of the protest, though no arrests had been made. Mayor Eric Adams was monitoring the protest, a City Hall spokesperson said in a text message.\n\nU.N. press officers didn't immediately respond to emails Saturday evening.\n\nOn Friday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported protesters at the Port of Oakland, in California, scaled a U.S. military vessel believed to be headed to Israel.\n\nIn Europe, at least 11 people were arrested in London on Saturday afternoon as a surge of hundreds of demonstrators shut down the Oxford Circus shopping and tourist district, blocking streets and chanting slogans in support of the Palestinian people.\n\n“This behavior clearly impacts on London’s ability to function normally and we are working quickly to reopen the road,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\n\nIn Paris, thousands marched to demand a cease-fire in the first mass gathering allowed by officials since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. As he marched, Wahid Barek, a 66-year-old retiree, told Reuters he opposed the killing of both Israelis and Palestinians. \"I deplore civilian deaths on both sides. Civilians have nothing to do with these actions. It really is shameful,\" he said.\n\nProtesters also took to the streets in Berlin, Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey to protest the bombardment of Gaza.\n\nToddlers and grandmothers join the crowd at protest in DC\n\nBy 2:30 p.m., Pennsylvania Avenue and other streets around the rally were thick with demonstrators as speakers began addressing the calm but energized assembly. Organizers said that 40 buses carrying attendees couldn't reach the plaza after streets were closed, organizers said. The passengers walked under cloud-streaked skies attempting to get as close as they could to the rally.\n\nThe crowd included participants using wheelchairs, toddlers and people of all races wearing the keffiya, a traditional scarf worn in Arab regions. Many held signs calling for an end to the war in Gaza, with some linking the Palestinian cause with other world events, including a placard that read: \"From Palestine to Mexico, these border walls have got to go.\"\n\nNavy vet among the swelling numbers at Gaza protest\n\nAs demonstrators filled Freedom Plaza, spilling out onto the surrounding streets, chanting \"cease-fire now\" at a deafening volume, James Colbow, a 69-year-old Navy veteran from Ohio, said he drove to the capital to show solidarity with embattled Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“I felt disappointment in my government that they’ve been complicit in these war crimes,” Colbow said.\n\nColbow said a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side-by-side, would be key to peace in the Middle East. \"I believe in the Jewish people’s right to self-determination but also for the Palestinians,” he said.\n\nWho planned the Gaza protest?\n\nThe D.C. demonstration was organized by the ANSWER Coalition, an umbrella group of anti-war and racial justice organizations, which advocates for ending the Israeli siege of Gaza and for the cessation of U.S. aid to Israel.\n\n\"Today is going to be the largest demonstration ever in the history of the United States in support of Palestinian social and civil rights, and for peace,\" Brian Becker, the coalition's executive director said in an interview before the event.\n\n\"We're sending a message to the Biden administration that we profoundly disagree with its position, which has opposed a ceasefire and has instead embraced Israel's genocidal-type assault against civilians in Gaza,\" Becker said. \"We're expecting, minimally, tens of thousands. I wouldn't be surprised if there are 100,000.\"\n\nNetanyahu rejects calls for a 'humanitarian pause'\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu deflected pleas by Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a \"humanitarian pause\" in the fighting that would allow food and medical supplies into Gaza.\n\n“I have made clear that we are continuing forcefully, and that Israel refuses a temporary cease-fire that does not include the release of our hostages,” Netanyahu said following a meeting with Blinken in Tel Aviv. “Israel does not allow the entry of fuel to the Gaza Strip and opposes the transfer of funds to Gaza.”\n\nMore:Israeli strikes kill civilians in Gaza at shelter, hospital; Blinken in Jordan: Updates\n\nHamas, the militant Islamist movement that controls Gaza, abducted an estimated 240 people from Israel during its stunning attack last month.\n\nBlinken stresses 'imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians'\n\nThe U.N., citing figures from the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, said Friday that 9,257 people had been killed in the coastal enclave by Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7 including 3,826 children. Fewer than one-third of Gaza's hospitals are operating and the territory has seven days of food stocks remaining, the U.N. said.\n\n“We stand strongly with and behind Israel in its right and obligation to defend itself, defend its people and take the steps necessary to try to ensure that this never happens again,” Blinken told reporters on Friday, while also emphasizing “the imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians, the imperative of doing everything possible to get assistance to those who need it.”\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/14/march-for-israel-washington-live-updates/71577255007/", "title": "Israel war updates: IDF enters Gaza hospital in move against Hamas", "text": "WASHINGTON − Thousands of Israel supporters gathered Tuesday to stand behind the military campaign against Hamas, demand the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza and condemn an increase in antisemitic incidents across the nation and world.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli military reported early Wednesday local time that its troops went into Gaza City's Al Shifa Hospital in an operation targeting Hamas forces. The move came after the Biden administration said for the first time that the U.S. has information Hamas is concealing military operations and hiding hostages under hospitals. Both Hamas and Al Shifa hospital staff deny the allegations.\n\n\"We call upon all Hamas terrorists present in the hospital to surrender,\" the Israeli Defense Forces said on X.\n\nThe organizers of the Washington rally, the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, described the effort as \"an opportunity for all Americans to come together in solidarity with the people of Israel to demonstrate our commitment to America’s most important ally\" in the region.\n\nDemonstrators, many clad in the blue and white of the Israeli flag and carrying signs expressing support for the country, streamed onto the National Mall in Washington throughout the day.\n\nGali Hampel, 18, and her 15-year-old sister Gayah traveled to the rally from Houston. Gali Hampel said she was in Israel on Oct. 7 and knows some of the more than 200 people who have been taken hostage. She described herself as half Israeli with great grandparents who survived the Holocaust and said the events of the last month have strengthened her desire to join the Israel Defense Forces, so she plans to return to Israel for her draft day in April\n\n“I've been raised in a very Zionist home and I’m proud of my Judaism and I want to do something,” Hampel said. “And after seeing this, I need to go and help and contribute to the protection of Israel.”\n\nHampel proudly wears her Star of David but said her parents and friends on college campuses have expressed concern that displaying Jewish symbols or walking to Hillel and other Jewish organizations could make them targets of antisemitic attacks.\n\n“I think it's a terrifying time especially to be Jewish,” said Hampel, who wants more attention focused on the plight of the 240 hostages still held captive in Gaza.\n\nBiden says hospitals must be protected:Fuel scarcity cripples facilities\n\nDevelopments in the war:\n\n∎ The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says its relief efforts will end soon because its fuel storage facility in Gaza is empty. The agency, known as UNRWA, has been trying to provide basic services to more than 600,000 people sheltering in south Gaza amid Israeli military operations and a ban on fuel imports.\n\n∎ Palestinian authorities are calling for a cease-fire to evacuate three dozen newborns and other patients from Gaza City’s Al Shifa Hospital. On Tuesday, a U.N. agency said only one hospital, the Al Ahli, remains operational in the battered north Gaza.\n\n∎ President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he works on the hostage issue every day and believes a breakthrough could be near. His message to families: ''Hang in there, we're coming.\" Read more here.\n\n∎ A consortium of Palestinian groups and individuals have asked a federal court in California to enjoin the Biden administration from providing arms, money and diplomatic support to Israel on grounds the administration is aiding in genocide against the civilian population of Gaza.\n\n∎ The Israeli military said it had gained control of the Hamas legislative and government building, the Hamas police headquarters and an engineering facility used for weapons production and development.\n\n∎ About 200,000 people have fled south over the past 10 days due to fighting between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants in northern Gaza, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Tuesday. More than two-thirds of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have left their homes since the war began.\n\n∎ Several hundred demonstrators protested outside the Israeli parliament Tuesday night and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he is unfit for office. The protesters carried signs blaming Netanyahu for the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nGaza Ministry of Health called for 'urgent' action prior to Israel's operation\n\nGaza Ministry of Health spokesperson Dr. Ashraf al-Qudra said in a statement Wednesday that the ministry is ready to receive international observers for the medical facilities at Al-Shifa Hospital and called for immediate intervention against the bombings around the hospital.\n\n\"We are ready to receive all international institutions at Al-Shifa Complex to ensure the nature of its medical work,\" al-Qudra said. \"We appeal to all countries to take urgent action to save the patients inside the Shifa Complex.\"\n\nAccording to al-Qudra, 1,500 medical staff members and about 7,000 displaced people are located inside the hospital.\n\nIsrael launches 'targeted operation' in Al-Shifa Hospital\n\nAt around the same time Israel said it would allow fuel into Gaza for humanitarian operations, its troops went into Gaza City's Al Shifa Hospital intent on rooting out Hamas forces.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was \"carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital, based on intelligence information and an operational necessity.''\n\nIsrael has long contended the militant group uses the hospital, the largest in the embattled enclave, and tunnels underneath it for military purposes. The White House said Tuesday it has intelligence to confirm that claim, which Hamas denies.\n\nIn recent days Israel Defense Forces have surrounded the medical facility, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge. With hundreds of patients and medical personnel inside, Israeli authorities had refrained from entering.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement it repeatedly warned Hamas against military uses of the hospital. \"Yesterday, the IDF conveyed to the relevant authorities in Gaza once again that all military activities within the hospital must cease within 12 hours,'' the statement said. \"Unfortunately, they did not.''\n\nThe extent of the IDF operation is not clear, though it said measures would be taken to protect civilians, who have died by the thousands in the reprisal to the brutal Hamas attack on Israeli border towns Oct. 7.\n\nNot long before announcing the incursion into the hospital, Israel defense officials said they had agreed to a U.S. request to let fuel enter Gaza for the first time since that assault.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian affairs, said it would allow U.N. trucks to refill at the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border later Wednesday. Lack of fuel and other necessities, along with constant bombardment, have made conditions in Gaza unbearable for many of its 2.3 million residents.\n\nFriend of protester who died after scuffle joins march\n\nJonathan Oswaks came to the \"March for Israel\" with a dual purpose – to support Israel and to seek justice for his friend Paul Kessler, who suffered a fatal head injury after a physical scuffle while counter-protesting a pro-Palestinians rally Nov. 5 in a Los Angeles suburb.\n\nOswaks said he invited his fellow 69-year-old Kessler to the fateful event. \"He was the only one that had the spirit and the guts to stand there with me,\" Oswaks said. \"How could I not come here after witnessing the death of a friend?\"\n\nOswaks said he also joined Tuesday's rally as a relative of a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. \"I'm hoping to see that Jews around the United States come here and stand together shoulder to shoulder and say never again,\" he said.\n\n'All of this is anti-Jewish,' counter-protesting rabbi says\n\nOutside the entrance to the march, a line of U.S. Park Police separated more than two dozen counter-protesters from pro-Israel demonstrators who occasionally shouted criticisms as they passed by.\n\nRabbi Dovid Feldman told USA TODAY from behind the line of protesters that he came from New York to join a multistate group to counter the idea that all Jews support the actions of the Israeli government.\n\n\"We are here because of this pro-Israeli rally taking place, insisting they represent all Jews,\" Feldman said. \"Unfortunately, by doing so they are incorporating all Jews into what Israel is doing.\"\n\nFeldman said the killing of Palestinian civilians constituted a violation of the values of Judaism. \"All of this is illegal. All of this is anti-Jewish,\" he said.\n\n\"We are so disturbed by this occupation, this genocide against the Palestinian people in our name,\" he said. \"We are so disturbed when Jews are facing the consequences of all that's being done in our name.\"\n\nFirst-time protester prompted to action by hate incidents\n\nDanielle Werchowsky said she has lived in Washington, D.C., for more than 45 years but had never attended a major protest − until Tuesday.\n\nWerchowsky, the mother of a college student and creator of Arlington Parents Against Antisemitism, said a rise in hate incidents in schools spurred her to action. She said even in a progressive city like Arlington, Virginia, she’s felt afraid and avoided wearing anything that would identify her as Jewish on the Metro.“I was really worried about being around a lot of Jews, because we're kind of this target,” she said. “But I just felt like it's really important for people to get out and come together and fight the hate that's out there. It is really frightening, honestly.”\n\nMarcher says US, Israel have kinship dealing with terrorism\n\nSig Libowitz, 50, said he was surprised but not shocked by the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Libowitz, a professor and lawyer who came from Maryland to participate, hopes the rally encourages Americans to support Israel because of a shared experience with terrorism.\n\n“I was not far away when 9/11 happened,” said Libowitz, formerly of New York. “We have to understand, it's a real issue and Israel is fighting on the front lines.”\n\nLibowitz said he hopes Biden and people across parties will support Israel to show “that there's a voice for freedom and for democracy.”\n\nRallying in support of Israel a family affair\n\nDavid Komeromski watched his son, Natan Sherwin, weave through the crowd, offering rally-goers buttons and Israeli flags.\n\nKomeromski said he, his wife and their 14-year-old twins flew in Tuesday from Canton, Ohio, where he serves as a rabbi. He and his wife have lived in Israel and have family there. News of the war that began after Hamas' brutal border attacks on Oct. 7 has been “all consuming,” he said.\n\nKomeromski remembers coming to Washington in 1987 for a large demonstration held by the Jewish community ahead of the fall of the Soviet Union. He said it was important for his kids to have a similar, positive experience.\n\n“It's nice to be with a very large group of people with whom we have so much in common,” he said Tuesday. “We're glad to be with kindred spirits to demonstrate in favor of a just peace and an end to the war and terrorism.”\n\nJewish community 'won't go down easy'\n\nSydney Kaufman, 33, arrived from New York hours before the start of the full rally and said she wants to show the world Jewish communities won’t be silenced.\n\n“I hope that the government and all of our representatives take notice of us,” Kaufman said.“We're not a quiet group. We don't go down easy, and we're fighting for something that's really important.”\n\nKaufman said pro-Israel events around New York in recent weeks were well attended. She was turned away from one after it quickly reached capacity.\n\n“We, culturally, historically have been through terrible things,” Kaufman said. “So please ... partner with us and help to stop the evil in the world and prevent terrorist groups from causing more damage.”\n\nMarch comes as war roars into sixth week\n\nThe \"March for Israel\" rally comes amid heightened global tensions as Israel continues a deadly assault on Gaza. Hamas' killing spree Oct. 7 stunned the world, leaving more than 1,200 dead and more than 240 taken as hostages into Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military has launched an air, sea and ground offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas and seizing the hostages, most of whom the Israeli government says are being held in a labyrinth of tunnels beneath northern Gaza. The war, now in its sixth week, has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, wounded thousands and left much of northern Gaza's already tenuous infrastructure in ruins, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nOn Sunday, more than 100,000 people marched through the streets of Paris to protest a rising tide of antisemitism in France. But pro-Palestinian rallies have been a recurring theme around the world in recent days. On Saturday, a pro-Palestinian march through London drew a crowd estimated by police at 300,000.\n\nAntisemitic incidents rose sharply after war began\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League reported an immediate and alarming spike in antisemitic incidents across the U.S. almost immediately after the war began Oct. 7. Preliminary data showed incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault rose by 400% from Oct. 7 to Oct. 23. Of the 312 incidents reported, 190 were \"directly linked\" to the Hamas-Israel war, the group said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security designated Tuesday's march a \"Level 1\" security event, the highest risk assessment, sources told ABC News and CNN. Reached for comment from USA TODAY, the department issued a statement saying it was \"coordinating with our federal counterparts to ensure support for partners,\" including the Park Police, Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nMarch organizers urge united front against Hamas\n\nEric Fingerhut, president of the Jewish Federations of North America, defended the war as a reflection of Israel's determination to eliminate the terrorist threat on its border and restore security to its people.\n\n\"Americans have rightly stood by Israel at this critical moment,\" Fingerhut said. \" This is a moment where all of us must stand against terror and defend what the terrorists seek to destroy.”\n\nWilliam Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, accused Hamas of brutal tactics that \"have no place in a civilized world\" and are aimed at undermining the effort for a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"It’s imperative that America sends a resounding message of support to our ally that we stand in solidarity with the victims, hostages and their families,\" he said. \"That we reject extreme anti-Israel rhetoric and sentiment, and that we are united around shared values of peace, justice and freedom.\"\n\nUS sanctions target leaders of Oct. 7 attack\n\nThe U.S. State Department announced new sanctions targeting Hamas-affiliated militants and groups in connection with the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Akram al-Ajouri, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's deputy secretary general, was named a \"specially designated global terrorist\" for leading the group's militant wing, the Al-Quds Brigade. The Treasury Department also designated for sanctions seven individuals and two groups that provided support to or acted on behalf of Hamas.\n\n“Hamas’ actions have caused immense suffering and shown that terrorism does not occur in isolation,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.\n\nIsrael, US at odds over postwar plan for Gaza\n\nThe Biden administration is advocating a postwar plan that would allow the Palestinian Authority, which now administers the West Bank, to largely govern Gaza in the absence of Hamas. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed not to \"cave\" to global pressure to cede control of Gaza to authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu said his government will retain security control over Gaza after the war.\n\n“There will ... not be a civil authority that educates its children to hate Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/10/israel-hamas-conflict-rallies-protests-united-states/71125567007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war: Thousands gather for vigils and protest after attack", "text": "As thousands of people across the United States gathered for vigils and protests over the rapidly intensifying Israel-Hamas war on Tuesday, several students recounted the stampede that injured 30 people during a Jewish-led candlelight vigil at a college campus in Florida\n\nStudents told The Gainesville Sun early Tuesday that they were already on edge prior to attending a Jewish-led candlelight vigil at the University of Florida. The event on Monday night erupted in chaos as dozens were trampled and injured in a student stampede that sent more than 30 people to a local hospital.\n\n“I was under the assumption that it was a terrorist attack of some kind. I assumed I was getting shot at,” said former University of Florida student Matt Gold.\n\nLike Gold, students had a split second to decide whether they also were going to run. Everyone bolted, some falling over each other. Gold said he ran until he felt safe, adding that he saw scores of students hurt in the chaos, including a young woman with a bloodied face.\n\n“Lots of people were crying and shaking. It was apparent people were very shaken up,” said the 30-year-old, who lost his Yamaka/kippah along the way.\n\nSkylar Hendler, a 20-year-old graduate student, said she had the same experience and immediately thought of her family as she ran.\n\n“I immediately tried calling my mom while I was running,” she said. “If there was a terrorist attack, and I was scared that I would get shot, then I wanted to have my mom on the phone before it happened and say goodbyes,” she said.\n\nThe university's communications department previously shared conflicting information, claiming only five students were injured and treated on-site. The department has yet to issue an updated official statement about those injured, leading multiple news outlets to misreport the gravity of the situation.\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what set off the commotion. Campus police said a woman in the crowd fainted and people misinterpreted a call for \"911\" while others said they heard popping noises or loud bangs.\n\nArab, Jewish communities in Detroit mourn, rally amid violence in Middle East\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 1,200 Palestinian supporters jammed an auditorium in Dearborn, Michigan, evening, including religious leaders and local politicians. Many waved Palestinian flags and the flags of other Arab nations, such as Lebanon, Morocco, Iraq, and Yemen, in addition to the American flag.\n\n\"From the river to sea, Palestine will be free,\" the crowd chanted at one point. They also chanted in Arabic about defending Al-Aqsa Mosque with their blood and their souls.\n\nA night earlier, about 2,500 Jewish people packed a historic synagogue in Southfield, Michigan, to show their support for Israel. It was attended by several elected officials, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Gary Peters, and Reps. Shri Thanedar and Haley Stevens, and several state legislators and local politicians.\n\n\"Let's say very plainly a few fundamental truths,\" Whitmer said on stage at Congregation Shaarey Zedek, the oldest and largest Conservative denomination synagogue in Michigan. \"We here in Michigan condemn this vile act of terrorism. We stand with Israel. And Israel has a right to defend itself.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Dearborn rally did not include political heavyweights like Whitmer, who had campaigned last year in Dearborn at Arab American events but avoided the large gathering Tuesday night.\n\n\"They say Hamas is a terrorist organization,\" Osama Siblani, a longtime Arab American leader and publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, said to the crowd. \"... The terrorist is (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu.\"\n\nJewish alliance in Rhode Island hosts vigil\n\nIn Rhode Island, the Jewish Alliance of Greater Providence hosted a vigil Monday evening in response to the crisis across the globe. \"It feels like a total nightmare,\" said Stephanie Hague, chief policy officer for the alliance. Hague said her in-laws in Jerusalem have been taking cover in a bomb shelter, and that her father and stepmother were in Israel to attend a wedding that has since been canceled and are now trying to get a flight back.\n\nRabbi Sarah Mack, senior rabbi of Temple Beth-El, said the community was celebrating Simchat Torah when the attacks began. The holiday marks when the Torah reading cycle restarts again and is a time of gratitude and rejoicing with Torah scrolls.\n\n“It is a sad and devastating time. This is not even one degree of separation for most people in the Jewish community,” Mack said. The temple is offering support as members of the community try to account for loved ones’ whereabouts, she said.\n\n\"This is not far from anyone. It has broken the hearts of many people in the community,\" Mack said. \"The Jewish community is gutted by this.\"\n\nPacked auditoriums at Ohio vigil\n\nIn Ohio, politicians, Jewish leaders, and private citizens packed two auditoriums at a prayer vigil Monday night, as Jewish leaders led attendees in prayer and song.\n\nOrganizers at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus called people to light candles for those affected by the war, including the relative of an Ohio family who had died in the attack. Politicians including state representatives, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, and Sen. Sherrod Brown attended Monday’s vigil.\n\nEvent organizers called on people to ask their political representatives to push for aid to Israel.\n\n\"Today Ohioans and Americans all over our great country are united with one message: We stand with Israel,\" Brown said.\n\nBut some in the community have voiced support for Palestinians they say have long suffered injustices at the hands of Israel, and are now concerned about what will happen to civilians as a result of Israel's declaration of war against Hamas. The Ohio State University chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, a pro-Palestine organization with chapters at universities around the United States, held a rally Sunday at the Ohio Statehouse attended by nearly 100 students and other community members.\n\n\"Today, October 7th, 2023, an unprecedented series of events have taken place, led by our heroic resistance in Gaza who have shown the world yet again that the spirit of the Palestinian people cannot and will not be trampled, and that our resistance to Zionism and Western imperialism remains strong,\" the group wrote in a Facebook post before the Statehouse event.\n\nPalestinians rally at New York park\n\nIn Rochester, New York, Palestinian supporters rallied at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park. Jonathan Corey, a Palestinian American organizer with the Rochester Committee to End Apartheid said about 50 to 60 people attended the coalition’s rally.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened and frustrated about the lack of sympathy and empathy toward Palestinians,\" said Iman Abid, a Palestinian American organizer with Free the People Roc. Corey said Palestinians have long been dehumanized and mischaracterized by forces across the globe, and events over the last few days have heightened a grim sense of disappointment.\n\n\"We feel like we’re screaming into a wall,\" Abid said.\n\nOrganizers also expressed frustration with how people in Gaza and the West Bank have been treated under occupation, citing human rights violations.\n\n\"Gaza lives under the most dismal circumstances,\" Corey said.\n\nTimeline of the conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years\n\nIsraeli supporters rally in Florida\n\nIn Ormond Beach, Florida, a group of Israeli supporters gathered at the Granada Bridge, holding posters emblazoned with the Israeli flag.\n\n\"I'm coming out to show support for the Jews locally, for Israel and for America,\" said Raquel Levy, an attorney who organized the demonstration as a way to show support for her cousins in Israel. She said she had spoken to one, Odelia Cohen, who took shelter under a stairwell with her dog and cat as Hamas rockets landed in the area.\n\n\"They are going after civilians, dragged from their homes, just minding their own business, trying to live their life the way all of us live life. Yet, they were dragged from their homes kidnapped, killed.\"\n\nLevy relayed a text message from her cousin that the pain is widespread throughout Israel.\n\nCohen said in her message: \"I feel so stressed cause of all the uncertainly. I don't know what the future holds. Israel is a small country and everyone now knows someone who has been murdered or injured.\"\n\nPalestinian supporters gather in Florida\n\nAbout 85 miles north from Levy, Palestinian supporters rallied in Jacksonville, Florida, Monday evening. Sara Mahmoud, a Palestinian American organizer for the Jacksonville Palestine Solidarity Network, noted high energy and turnout of more than 100 people for the grassroots organization’s demonstration.\n\n\"We stand with Palestine, and we stand with the Palestinian people,\" Mahmoud said.\n\nThe longstanding conflict is often characterized as one of religion, but Mahmoud argued it was a conflict of occupation. The organization is demanding the end of three things: U.S. aid to Israel, siege and blockade in Gaza, and Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\n\"Palestinians have a right to dignity and self-determination,\" Mahmoud said.\n\nRallies follow massive presence over weekend\n\nThe demonstrations Monday followed widespread rallies across the U.S. over the weekend, from Times Square to Los Angeles.\n\nA skirmish broke out Sunday between opposing demonstrators near the United Nations compound in New York City after a large group of Palestinian supporters rallied in Times Square, and others protested outside Israeli consulates in Atlanta and Chicago.\n\nDozens of rallies have already taken place since this weekend, and many more are scheduled for the coming days.\n\nContributing: Gainesville Sun; Bailey Gallion, Columbus Dispatch; Frank Fernandez, Daytona Beach News-Journal; Katie Mulvaney, Providence Journal; Niraj Warikoo, Detroit Free Press; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/08/israel-palestine-supporters-rallies-hamas-attack-united-states/71112473007/", "title": "Israeli and Palestinian supporters rally across US after Hamas attack ...", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Israel and Palestinian supporters gathered in cities across the U.S. on Sunday as the world watched in shock and horror at the conflict that has killed hundreds and wounded thousands in the Middle East.\n\nA skirmish broke out between opposing demonstrators near the United Nations compound in New York City after a large group of Palestinian supporters rallied in Times Square. Meanwhile, Palestinian Americans protested outside the Israeli consulates in Atlanta and Chicago. The incursion left many Jewish communities and organizations in disbelief — drawing widespread condemnation — as it coincided with Simchat Torah celebrations, a major Jewish holiday.\n\nIn San Francisco, a Jewish community gathered at the Congregation Sherith Israel, one of the oldest synagogues in the United States. Some students from Israel’s Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, 25 miles from Gaza, were visiting San Francisco for a week as part of a delegation from the Hillel organization.\n\nThey expressed their eagerness to return home and help out in any way they could. Yuval Appleboim, 26, told USA TODAY that his family lives less than 20 miles from Gaza.\n\n\"My sister and my nephews are in a bunker right now. Sometimes they have the electricity cut off. My uncle had a rocket land just two houses away,\" Appleboim said. \"It’s really hard to be so far away from your friends at this time. I have a friend who left his 9-day-old daughter to go serve with the reserves.\"\n\nAppleboim, who is also a reservist in the Israeli military, said his unit had been called to action and he wants to get back as soon as possible to help.\n\n\"I’m pro-Palestinian, I think many Israelis are pro-Palestinian in the fact that they want a better future with the Palestinian people, they want peace,\" Appleboim added. \"But this is the tragedy: The terror organization attacking Israel is not only killing thousands of Israelis but it’s causing the death of so many Palestinians and doesn’t care about their own lives.\"\n\nTimeline of conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years\n\n'This is a moment to not be alone'\n\nYael Shafrir, 28, shared the same sentiments during the gathering in San Francisco. While it was difficult to attend the gathering on Sunday, Shafrir said the community felt support from the world.\n\n“It was difficult to come (to the temple today) but for us this is a moment to not be alone, feeling like the community around the world is hugging us and supporting us.,\" Shafrir said. \"We really need that.\"\n\nShafrir also noted the complexity of the conflict, signaling the people caught in the crosshairs.\n\n“We do not want to fight against Palestinians. Our intention is not to harm anybody, any resident of the Gaza Strip,\" Shafrir said. \"Eventually they’re fighting a terror organization, not the people. That’s what the army is working really hard to do, to not harm innocent people.\"\n\nPalestinians 'capable of fighting back'\n\nHatem Abudayyeh, co-founder and national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), said his organization was concerned over the death toll and injuries but noted that people were \"inspired by the unified Palestinian Resistance.\"\n\nThe USPCN, according to Abudayyeh, is a community-based institution that helps strengthen grass-roots organizing in Palestinian and Arab communities across the United States. Abudayyeh said in an email to USA TODAY that there is a \"rich\" history of resistance among Palestinians and it was not a surprise that attacks happened.\n\n\"Our people are still capable of fighting back and defending their homes and land, it makes us want to organize even harder to support them from the 'belly of the beast,'\" Abudayyeh said.\n\nAbudayyeh, who is based in Chicago, added the USPCN coordinating with all of its chapters to provide resources for organizing in their communities. He said thousands of people have gathered on Sunday to protest outside Israeli consulates on Sunday, including 2,000 in Chicago and 1,000 in San Francisco.\n\nUnrest in the Middle EastCould the Israel-Hamas war mean $5-a-gallon gas prices at the pump?\n\n'Liberation is at stake'\n\nSeparated by a line of police officers wearing helmets and carrying batons, pro-Israel demonstrators and Palestinian supporters chanted slogans, waved flags and signs, and yelled at each other in front of the San Francisco Israeli Consulate on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile one side chanted \"Free, free, free Palestine,\" the other responded with, \"Shame, shame\" the day after the Hamas massacre on Israeli soil.\n\nRami Abdelkarim, 23, a U.S.-born Palestinian with extended family in the motherland, denounced what he called an Israeli occupation and said the Hamas attack was the escalation of decades of resistance, this one prompted by an increase in Israeli settlements.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about an Israeli reprisal, Abdelkarim said: \"Absolutely. Israel is the biggest recipient of United States military funding.\"\n\nBut Abdelkarim, an organizer for the Palestinian Youth Movement, added that for Palestinians back home, \"when their livelihoods and their liberation is at stake, Israel does not scare them.” Read more here.\n\nYasin Ayesh, 29, a Bay Area resident draped in a Palestinian flag, said he attended the rally to advocate for an end to the occupation and for Palestinians to get the same human rights as Israelis. Born in California, he visited relatives in the West Bank most recently in 2019 and said there were no big problems then but the city where his family lives, Jenin, is under military occupation with checkpoints, and water and electricity are hard to come by in some areas.\n\n\"The people there don’t have real medical care, they don’t have what they need when it comes to food, the children don’t have any education because of apartheid,\" Ayesh said. \"They have every right as every human being.\"\n\nAyesh said he doesn’t advocate any loss of life, but accounts of the attack require context.\n\n“We have to first look at what happened before the attack. That was a history of people being mistreated for 45 years. … That’s what led to the attacks, to the resistance.\"\n\nLack of optimism\n\nShai Elnekave, 49, an Israeli-Australian who attended the temple rally Sunday, worried for loved ones. Elnekave said it’s a small country and most people know someone affected.\n\n“They have crossed a line that I think is going to be very hard to go back from. This is only the beginning and now there’s going to be a huge wave of Israeli counterattack and retaliation, and there’s a war in place.’’\n\n“I really wish we could find – with U.S. intervention, with world intervention – some sort of treaty that will resolve this. I wish. But sadly, I am not optimistic, because there are extremists on both ends, and it’s important to mention that.’’\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/china/china-lockdown-protests-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's lockdown protests: What you need to know | CNN", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChina has moved quickly to suppress demonstrations that erupted across the country against the government’s zero-Covid policy on the weekend, deploying police forces at key protest sites and tightening online censorship.\n\nOn Tuesday, while defending the policy, top health officials appeared to acknowledge its impact and pledged to “reduce inconvenience” to the public by lifting lockdowns “as quickly as possible” following outbreaks.\n\nHowever, it may not be enough to appease the protesters, who took to the streets of several major cities and university campuses to demand an end to the country’s increasingly costly lockdowns.\n\nAs numbers swelled, so too did the range of grievances aired, with some even calling for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who for nearly three years has overseen a strategy of mass-testing, lockdowns, enforced quarantine and digital tracking.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat’s behind the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere have protests taken place?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang “The Internationale,” a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nWhy are these protests significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out in October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday, flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering.\n\nThe Shanghai protests on Saturday led to scuffles between demonstrators and police, with arrests made in the early hours of the morning. Undeterred, protesters returned on Sunday, where they met a more aggressive response – videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging, and beating protesters.\n\nThe videos have since been scrubbed from the Chinese internet by censors.\n\nOne Shanghai protester told CNN he was one of around 80 to 110 people detained in the city on Saturday night. He described being transferred to a police station, having his phone confiscated and biometric information collected before being released a day later.\n\nTwo foreign reporters were also briefly detained. BBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested in Shanghai on Sunday night, with a BBC spokesperson claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police” while covering the protests. He has since been released.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nMichael Peuker, China correspondent for Swiss public broadcaster RTS, was reporting live when he said several police officers approached him. He later posted on Twitter that the officers took him and his cameraman into a vehicle, before releasing them.\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether the widespread displays of public anger would make China consider ending zero-Covid, Zhao replied, “What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Zhao further defended zero-Covid, claiming Chinese citizens “enjoy various legal rights and freedoms that are fully protected by law. At the same time, any rights and freedoms should be exercised within the framework of the law.”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27.

U.S. officials should recognize that unrest is driven by “inhumane, unjust and oppressive” policies toward Palestinians, said Sayel Kayed, chair of AMP-NJ.\n\nIsrael maintains that Hamas, the militant group in Gaza, which has fired more than 3,000 rockets at Israel, is to blame for the violence and that it is acting in self-defense.\n\nPaterson is home to one of the largest Arab and Palestinian communities in the United States, and in many local stores and businesses, national flags and photos of Jerusalem are proudly displayed.\n\nThe city has had pro-Palestinian rallies before, but this was among the largest, as people have been galvanized by images and posts on social media about the conflict and progressive groups have embraced the cause.\n\nThe rally Sunday was also organized by the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton. Black Lives Matter, Jewish Voice for Peace and the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, a statewide coalition of advocacy and faith groups, were among the groups that publicly supported the rally Sunday.

Tensions have been escalating for weeks amid pending home evictions of Palestinians in east Jerusalem by Israeli settler groups and police raids and clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem.\n\nA week ago, Hamas began firing a barrage of rockets at Israel, forcing civilians to flee into bomb shelters. In turn, Israel carried out airstrikes over Gaza that have flattened homes and buildings, including a building that housed Associated Press and Al-Jazeera media offices.\n\nThe most recent strike was Sunday, when Israeli airstrikes leveled three buildings and killed at least 42 people, in the deadliest single attack since heavy fighting broke out a week ago.\n\nAt least 188 Palestinians have been killed in airstrikes, including 55 children and 33 women, with 1,230 people wounded, the Associated Press reported. Eight people in Israel have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.\n\nThe weekend’s protests also marked Nakba Day, which commemorates the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948 when Israel was created.\n\nHannan Adely is a diversity reporter for NorthJersey.com.

Organizers with the group No To APEC have vowed to shut down the conference down and block access to the summit that as many as 20,000 people will be attending in various capacities.\n\nAt a rally and march of several thousand people in downtown San Francisco on Sunday, Violette Mansour with the Palestinian Youth Movement said she was there to call out the political leaders and CEOs \"that prioritize plunder and profit and exploitation over protecting our people and land and environment.\"\n\nShe especially called out Biden for not listening to those calling for a cease-fire in Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Our elected officials really need to grapple with the fact that the majority of their base is made up of people and voters who do not support what they're doing right now,\" she said. \"This is going to affect them\" in next year's elections.\n\nThe march began with a two-hour rally of dozens of speakers, singers and poets speaking in English, Spanish and Tagalog. There were drummers, chants, rappers and at least one group dressed in giant Pikachu costumes from Pokémon, and dozens upon dozens of Palestinian flags. But while the crowd was lively, the topics were serious.\n\nThat issue brought Mike Edwards, 36, to the march. He and his wife met in elementary school. He's Jewish, she's Palestinian and they brought their young children on Sunday to call for change.\n\n\"It's such a disappointment,\" he said of the Biden administration's response to deaths in Gaza. \"I grew up in a Democratic household,\" he said. \"It's insane and infuriating to see them turn a blind eye to the suffering.\"\n\nThe largest demonstration is expected to take place on Wednesday, when Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in the Bay Area.\n\nMore:San Francisco, hoping to resuscitate its 'doom loop' post-pandemic image, hosts APEC (and Biden)\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is one of the most liberal areas of the country, and the city has a long tradition and proud culture of protest. Just 6.9% of San Francisco's voters were Republican as of September. California itself is heavily Democratic and has not voted for a Republican for president for more than 30 years.\n\nYet even in California, 52% of voters say they are unhappy with Biden's performance as president, with more disapproving of the way he has handled relations with China and the fighting between Israel and Hamas than those who were supportive.\n\nThe survey that was was produced by the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies showed Biden experiencing a seven percent drop in support among Democrats in the state since May. His support has also dropped nine percent since then among voters who cast a ballot for him in California in the last election.\n\nMany at Sunday's protest were focused much more broadly than just American politics. \"It's never been about Biden,\" said Nancy Hollander, 84, who was there with an environmental group called 1,000 Grandmothers. \"We're opposing a pact which brings together governments and corporations that set the rules and regulations that transcend the legitimacy of national and state regulations,\" she said. The deals coming out of APEC give too much power to corporations.\n\n\"The message is 'We don't trust you will take care of us - we don't trust you to look out for the interests of regular people,\" said her friend Bonnie Richmond, 72, said.\n\nThe planned week of protests is very much in the grand San Francisco tradition of vocal and public dissent, said San Francisco resident Jane Natoli, 42, an activist with the pro-housing group YIMBY and a “proud trans woman.” They're about seizing the moment to bring attention to the issues people care about in a global forum.\n\n“There’s always going to be a fringe in San Francisco that’s further to the left than most places and is not happy. Even if this were President Bernie Sanders coming, they wouldn’t be happy,” she said.\n\nThe planned, organized protests center on opposition to neoliberal capitalism, colonialism and military imperialism. The No2APEC organizing principles specifically say they oppose the group “as an exclusive and elitist Country club of the rich representing the interests of big business,” free-trade that exploits workers and puts “the benefits of corporations over the rights of nations and peoples” and ends with “We support all oppressed & exploited peoples as they confront corporate greed!\n\nThat's what brought Joopy Nicholas, 25, out on Sunday. \"You don't have to be an anti-imperialist. You don't have to be an activist or an organizer to know that what's happening at APEC is wrong,\" he said.\n\nNot enough has changed for working Americans, Nicholas said. \"It's so easy to blame the other party, to blame Republicans. But [the Democrats] are also part of the US government. They also have the responsibility to make sure that people are cared for.\"\n\nMuch of the downtown area where the conference will be held was blocked off by tall black metal fencing and the police presence was noticeable, including a large police mobile command unit parked outside the Apple store at Union Square. By Friday homeless people had largely been pushed out of the downtown area, sidewalks cleaned, new planters with real plants and fake flowers hung from light posts and signage welcoming attendees.\n\nOn Saturday as many as 1,000 people gathered at San Francisco State University in the city’s southwest corner for a day-long teach in that included talks and workshops on workers’ rights, unions, climate, analysis of neoliberal economic policies and panels on the Israel-Hamas war and Palestinian rights.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says that more than 11,000 Palestinians have died since the fighting began. The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched a vicious coordinated attack on Israel, killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government.\n\nDemocrats are split on Biden's handling of the issue. In an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey, 44% of Democrats felt Biden was too supportive of Israel and 44% percent thought he was too support of the Palestinians.\n\nFar-left protesters demanding a cease-fire in Gaza repeatedly interrupted testimony by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Biden's emergency national security request to a Senate committee in late October. That same week Biden was heckled at a private fundraiser by a rabbi calling for a cessation in the fighting who pushed him to explain the difference between a cease-fire and a humanitarian pause.\n\nA protest in support of Palestine came to the White House's doorstep several days later while Biden was away for the weekend in Delaware. Protesters splashed red paint on the complex's northern gate and stained its concrete pillars with red hand prints.\n\nA pro-Israel protest is expected in Washington on Tuesday, when Biden is scheduled to leave for San Francisco.\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal has been warning Biden has to be careful about the way he expresses his support for Israel.\n\nShe said that polling that shows him losing to former President Donald Trump in next year's general election is concerning. \"This is the first time...that I have felt like the 2024 election is in great trouble for the president and for our Democratic control,\" she said in an NBC interview.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, told Biden the American people \"are not with you on this one\" in a video on social media this month in which she pledged: \"We will remember in 2024.\"\n\n\"Support cease-fire now or don't count on us in 2024,\" Tlaib said.\n\nIn another sign of division within the party, the House later voted to censure Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, over comments that were critical of Israel and characterized by some as antisemitic in nature. The resolution passed in the GOP-led House with the support of 22 Democrats.\n\nJason McDaniel, a professor of political science at San Francisco State University who specializes in urban politics and voting behavior, said polls show a softness in support of key parts of Biden’s Democratic coalition, especially among younger voters, and the divisions over Israel are part of it.\n\n“There’s a sense of some discontent,\" he said.\n\n“That’s different from saying this is going to affect voting next year. Biden will get 75 to 80% of votes in San Francisco in 2024,” he said. “I don’t think it’s the kind of discontent that’s going to keep people from voting for Biden next year.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/05/24/ceasefire-israel-palestine-protests-continue-metro-detroit/5220763001/", "title": "Israel-Palestine protests continue in metro Detroit", "text": "Metro Detroit's Arab American community continued to protest by the thousands in support of Palestine after the announcement of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in an 11-day military confrontation with deadly airstrikes.\n\nChants of \"Free Palestine\" echoed in Ann Arbor, Warren and Detroit during the weekend protests. They follow similar protests in recent weeks, where 100 people in West Bloomfield came out in support of Israel and 10,000 people gathered in Dearborn opposition to President Joe Biden's stance that Israel has the right to defend itself in the crisis. He was visiting the Ford Rouge plant at the time; he supported the cease-fire announced Thursday.\n\nThis weekend, protests in support of Palestine took place in Ann Arbor on Saturday with over 4,000 people and in Cadillac Square in Detroit on Sunday with about 1,000.\n\nPeople of all races and ethnicities were in the crowd, and Palestinians also had support from some members of the Jewish community of metro Detroit.\n\nMeanwhile, Rabbi Asher Lopatin, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council/American Jewish Committee of Detroit, who spoke to the pro-Israel gathering last week and has expressed upset with violence by Hamas, said his organization wants to uplift the Palestinian community and supports a two-state solution.\n\nAs of Saturday, at least 230 Palestinians and 12 Israelis had been killed, USA TODAY reported. Although the airstrikes have stopped in cease-fire, reports have continued to emerge of some violence on the ground.\n\nIt is estimated that over 58,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes, at least 18 hospitals and clinics were damaged and one health facility has been destroyed, including the coronavirus testing lab in Gaza City, USA TODAY reported.\n\nPoliticians in the United States have been divided on the crisis. There were 28 Democratic senators that called for a cease-fire May 16, but Michigan's senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, were originally not on board. Later, they expressed support. On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit met with President Joe Biden about the violence and human rights abuses against Palestinians by Israelis, and the steps that the country needs to take to address it.\n\n\"This time is different,\" said state Rep.

We will not forget and we won't be forgetting anytime soon.\"\n\nAbdul El-Sayed, a former gubernatorial primary election candidate in 2018 and medical doctor who is Arab American, said that this is a human rights and justice issue and that it shouldn't matter the color of your skin or how you pray to be valuable as a human.\n\n\"As a doctor, I have spent the last 16 months working to take on the pandemic... educating people about the basic things we can do to protect ourselves from the terror of COVID-19,\" El-Sayed said. \"The reality is I thought that my government was an ally in that fight every step of the way. And yet, I've watched ($38) billion of our government taxpayer money funding a military that has destroyed testing facilities for COVID-19, killed some of the leading doctors in Gaza.\"\n\nOne of the organizers of the protest, Mahmoud Issa, 23, of Ann Arbor, is a founder of Sandbox, an organization founded by eight friends whose families are from Ramoon, Palestine. The organization has hosted protests in support of Syria and Black Lives Matter. He said change needs to continue outside of the marches and protests.\n\nWhat Issa wants to see is peace.\n\n\"We don't want to be under another leader's rule,\" Issa said. \"We want to be under our own rule. We want to have our own army. I want my grandma to be able to go back overseas, and if she wants to live there, she could. We just want the ability to do what we want to do at our land. My dad and my grandma are older than Israel, and it's not fair that they can't do what they want at their own house.\"\n\nReema Hussein, 38, from Detroit, said it feels hopeless, horrible and heartbreaking watching the destruction of Palestine take place. She said it's the worst feeling she could imagine, especially since she can't do much about it.\n\n\"The people are obviously more powerful than us and the government, like this is the most that we can do and I just don't understand how this is legal,\" Hussein said.\n\nOn Sunday, protests also took place in Warren and Detroit in support of Palestine. The protest in Warren drew over 100 people. Morgan El Zeinab, 35, from Macomb County, said there won't be a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until the control over Palestinian territories end.\n\n\"Not even 12 hours after the cease-fire, they went again and attacked people at the same place of worship,\" said El Zeinab.\n\nAssem El Zeinab, 50, who is Palestinian, adds: \"We're not saying divide or get rid of Israel, but at least we have a right to live our life...

We were mad for them.\"\n\nSome Jewish organizations stand with Palestine\n\nSome Jewish organizations in the metro Detroit area have been joining the marches in support of peace for Palestine.\n\nThe national grassroots organization Jewish Voice for Peace has a branch in Detroit which supports Palestinians in the ending of the occupation with a goal of peace. The organization hopes that Israel and Palestine will have equal rights for all citizens.\n\n\"It is vitally important for us to support Palestine, not just during this particular moment as the area welcomes a cease-fire,\" said Barbara Barefield of Jewish Voice for Peace-Detroit, in a Facebook message. \"The violence and human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinians by the Israelis, with the support of billions of dollars of U.S. funding, has been ongoing for decades and must stop. A cease-fire does not end the decades of oppression that the Palestinians have endured since their Nakba (Catastrophe) 73 years ago, when some 750,000 Palestinians were displaced and exiled from their homes (and still cannot return to them).\"\n\nBarefield added: \"The cease-fire does not give Palestinians equal rights, dignity and opportunities enjoyed by Israelis. ...But an end to this oppression and undemocratic, inhumane occupation has been the right thing to support for decades.\"\n\nDetroit Jewish organization supports two-state solution\n\nLopatin, of the Jewish Community Relations Council/American Jewish Committee of Detroit, said the organization supports a two-state solution, but also wants to uplift the Palestinian community. Some Palestinians support a one-state solution if given full citizenship rights. The nonprofit organization has an advisory council for Jewish people to connect with Muslims, Black Jews, Hindus, Chaldeans and more.\n\nLopatin, who reiterated his concerns with violence by Hamas, said the cease-fire is good, and now is the time to rebuild its relationships with the Arab American community in Detroit and in Israel and Palestine.\n\n\"We believe that a two-state solution is the most hopeful solution, and so we advocate for a Jewish state and a Palestinian state living side by side,\" Lopatin said.\n\nHe said he believes the co-existence is going to happen, but he thinks that there needs to be a way to solve the violence when it happens.\n\n\"The best way to move towards a two-state solution is to empower Palestinians on the ground, grassroots,\" Lopatin said. \"We need to be here in Detroit, a beacon of hope of how we can work together, and that's going to help the Palestinians and the Israelis.\"\n\nFree Press staff writers Miriam Marini, Todd Spangler and Niraj Warikoo and USA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nContact staff writer Chanel Stitt on Twitter: @ByChanelStitt.

Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time in decades, thousands of people have defied Chinese authorities to protest at universities and on the streets of major cities, demanding to be freed not only from incessant Covid tests and lockdowns, but strict censorship and the Communist Party’s tightening grip over all aspects of life.\n\nAcross the country, “want freedom” has become a rallying cry for a groundswell of protests mainly led by the younger generation, some too young to have taken part in previous acts of open dissent against the government.\n\n“Give me liberty or give me death!” crowds by the hundreds shouted in several cities, according to videos circulating online, as vigils to mark the deaths of at least 10 people in a fire in Xinjiang spiraled into political rallies.\n\nVideos circulating online seem to suggest China’s strict zero-Covid policy initially prevented emergency workers from accessing the scene, angering residents across the country who have endured three years of varying Covid controls.\n\nSome protesters chanted for free speech, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and other political demands across cities from the eastern financial hub of Shanghai to the capital Beijing, the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and Chengdu in the west.\n\nCNN has so far verified 23 demonstrations that took place across 17 Chinese cities.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Protesters take to Hong Kong's streets in solidarity with mainland 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, some met a stronger response from authorities – and security has been tightened across cities in a country were authorities have far-reaching surveillance and security capabilities.\n\nIn Beijing, a heavy police presence was apparent on Monday evening, a day after protests broke out there. Police vehicles, many parked with their lights flashing, lined eerily quiet streets throughout parts of the capital, including near Liangmaqiao in the city’s central Chaoyang district, where a large crowd of protesters had gathered Sunday night.\n\nWhen asked Monday whether “the widespread display of anger and frustration” seen across the country could prompt China to move away from its zero-Covid approach, a Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed suggestions of dissent.\n\n“What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened,” said spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who added that authorities had been “making adjustments” to their Covid policies based on “realities on the ground.”\n\n“We believe that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people our fight against Covid-19 will be successful,” he said.\n\nDemonstrators hold up blank sheets of paper during a protest in Beijing on November 28. Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn a symbolic protest against ever-tightening censorship, young demonstrators across China held up sheets of white paper – a metaphor for the countless critical posts, news articles and outspoken social media accounts that were wiped from the internet.\n\n“I think in a just society, no one should be criminalized for their speech. There shouldn’t be only one voice in our society – we need a variety of voices,” a Beijing protester told CNN in the early hours of Monday as he marched down the city’s Third Ring Road with a thin pile of white A4 paper.\n\n“I hope in the future, I will no longer be holding a white piece of paper for what I really want to express,” said the protester, who CNN is not naming due to concerns about repercussions for speaking out.\n\nThe United Nations on Monday urged Chinese authorities to guarantee people’s “right to demonstrate peacefully,” Secretary General spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said at a daily briefing.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by the US. During a briefing on Monday, John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, repeatedly reiterated the administration’s policy that “people should be allowed the right to assemble and to peacefully protest policies or laws or dictates that that they take issue with.”\n\nBritain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak criticized China on Monday, saying “instead of listening to their people’s protests, the Chinese Government has chosen to crack down further, including by assaulting a BBC journalist.”\n\nHe was referring to the Sunday arrest of Edward Lawrence by police in Shanghai. The journalist was covering the protest in the city and has since been released, according to the BBC.\n\nThroughout the weekend, censors moved swiftly to scrub videos and photos of the protests from the Chinese internet, though the startling images made headlines worldwide.\n\nIn online commentaries, Chinese state media made no mention of the protests, instead focusing on the strengths of Beijing’s anti-Covid policies, emphasizing they were both “scientific and effective.”\n\nBut to many protesters, the demonstrations are about much more than Covid – they’re bringing together many liberal-minded young people whose attempts to speak out might otherwise be thwarted by strict online censorship.\n\nA Shanghai resident in their 20s who took part in the candlelight vigil in the early hours of Sunday said they were greeted by other young people holding white papers, flowers and shouting “want freedom” as they walked toward the makeshift memorial.\n\n“My friends and I have all experienced Shanghai’s lockdown, and the so-called ‘iron fist’ (of the state) has fallen on all of us,” they told CNN, “That night, I felt that I could finally do something. I couldn’t sit still, I had to go.”\n\nThey broke into tears quietly in the crowd as the chants demanding freedom grew louder.\n\n“At that moment, I felt I’m not alone,” they said. “I realized that I’m not the only one who thinks this way.”\n\nShanghai residents held a candlelight vigil to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire on November 26. AP\n\nPolitical dissent\n\nIn some cases, the protests have taken on an even more defiant tone and openly called for political change.\n\nDuring the first night of the demonstrations in Shanghai, a crowd shouted “Step down, Xi Jinping! Step down, Communist Party!” in an unprecedented, direct challenge to the top leader. On Sunday night, some protesters again chanted for the removal of Xi.\n\nIn Chengdu, the protesters did not name Xi, but their message was hard to miss. “Opposition to dictatorship!” chanted hundreds of people packing the bustling river banks in a popular food and shopping district on Sunday evening, according to videos and a participant.\n\n“We don’t want lifelong rulers. We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to the Chinese leader, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nAccording to the participant, the crowd also protested against revisions to the party charter and the state constitution – which enabled Xi to further cement his hold on power and scrap presidential term limits.\n\nMuch like in Shanghai, the gathering started as a small candlelight vigil for people killed in the fire in Urumqi on Thursday.\n\nDemonstrators in Chengdu held a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire on November 27. Obtained by CNN\n\nBut as more people gathered, the vigil turned into a louder arena to air political grievances.\n\n“Everyone started shouting these slogans very naturally,” the participant said. “It is so rare that we have such a large-scale gathering and demonstration. The words of mourning didn’t feel enough, and we had to shout out some words that we want to say.”\n\nTo her, the experience of suffocating censorship inevitably fuels desire for “institutional and spiritual freedom,” and mourning the victims and demanding democracy and freedom are two “inseparable” things.\n\n“We all know that the reason why we have to keep undergoing lockdowns and Covid tests is that this is a political movement, not a scientific and logical response of epidemic prevention,” she said. “That’s why we have more political demands other than lifting lockdowns.”\n\nThe Chengdu protester said she felt encouraged by the wave of demonstrations sweeping the country.\n\n“It turns out there are so many people who are wide awake,” she said. “I feel like I can see a glimmer of light coming through ahead.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Selina Wang", "Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/05/18/protest-blast-president-biden-over-israel-support/5141942001/", "title": "Arab Americans protest Biden visit to Dearborn over Israel support", "text": "Saying they feel betrayed, thousands of Arab Americans protested across Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon as President Joe Biden arrived in the city to tour a Ford Rouge plant, blasting the president over his support for Israel during its conflict with Palestinians.\n\n\"We are here today to make sure that President Biden knows that the Dearborn community and the Arab American community and all of Michigan, that we are not going to stay silent while he waltzes into our city while saying he is giving unwavering support to the Israeli government,\" Palestinian American attorney Amer Zahr said outside the Dearborn Police station to a crowd during the protest.\"That war criminal Joe Biden ... thinking he can just come in here, walk into the Ford Rouge plant, say a few words and leave. ... You're not welcome here.\"\n\nWaving Palestinian flags and signs that criticized Israel and the president, the crowd repeatedly chanted \"Free, free Palestine,\" with Zahr urging the crowd to direct their voices toward the Ford plant a couple of miles east of the police station.\n\nZahr's views were echoed by a number of speakers at the rally and two other protests in different parts of Dearborn organized by various Arab American groups. Dearborn's population is 47% Arab American and the region has a sizable community of people with roots in the Middle East.\n\nMore:Arab Americans plan to protest Biden's visit to Dearborn amid tensions over Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\nMore:Tlaib meets with Biden on Israeli-Palestinian conflict ahead of Ford visit\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, and state Rep. Abdullah Hammoud, D-Dearborn, who were among the elected officials inside the Ford plant, spoke to Biden, pressing him on the issue of Israel. Tlaib spoke to Biden at Detroit Metro Airport and Hammoud had a brief exchange with the president, handing him a letter expressing his concerns about what is happening to Palestinians.\n\n\"He gave a commitment to read and respond,\" Hammoud said.\n\nOn Monday evening, the White House had a private online meeting not announced to the public with a group of about 20 Arab American leaders, including Osama Siblani, publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, Siblani said Tuesday. Siblani said he slammed Israel and told the White House officials he would not apologize for Palestinians defending themselves against Israeli attacks.\n\nThat meeting didn't help assuage the brewing anger in Dearborn. Signs ripping Biden and Israel read: \"Biden, Stop Funding Genocide\" and \"Israel is Real Terrorism.\"\n\n\"We gave Joe Biden more than 70% of our vote and he gave us nothing in return,\" Siblani told the crowd, referring to the Arab American vote in Dearborn and other areas for Biden in November. \"He promised us a seat around the table and we got nothing around the table. We respected him and we respected the two senators from our state who are Democrats, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, and we got nothing in return from them but humiliation. And therefore, don't take our votes for granted anymore.\"\n\nIn October, Jill Biden came to Dearborn to campaign for the Arab American vote, praising Arab Americans and telling them that if Joe Biden becomes president, Arab Americans will have a \"seat at the table.\"\n\nAdding to the concerns of Arab Americans was some of Biden's comments to reporters made during a test drive in Dearborn.\n\nIn remarks captured on video, Biden appears to dismiss a reporter's questions about Israel as he sits inside a new Ford all-electric pickup.\n\nThe reporter says to Biden: “Can I ask you a quick question on Israel before you drive?\"\n\nBiden replies: “No, you can’t. Not unless you get in front of the car as I step on it.”\n\nThe press corps can be heard chuckling and Biden adds: \"I'm only teasing.\"\n\nHe then sped away, reported USA Today. Biden didn't comment on Israel.\n\nBiden's remarks while in the test truck drew criticism on social media from Arab Americans and others who support Palestinians.\n\nIn the morning, several Arab American and Muslim groups, including the American Arab & Muslim Political Action Committee and American Human Rights Council, held a news conference outside the American Moslem Society mosque calling upon Biden to pressure Israel to stop its attacks. The mosque sits close to the Ford Rouge plant.\n\nLater, a couple of thousand people gathered at the police station and then marched down Michigan Avenue, as they did on Sunday.\n\nMore:Dearborn ends online speaking for council meetings, drawing protests\n\nA third, smaller rally with dozens of protesters was held Tuesday afternoon at Lapeer Park, which also sits close to the Ford Rouge plant. There, speakers sought to link the struggles of Palestinians to other movements such as Black Lives Matter, opposing U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen and environmental issues.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of demographics as organizers from multiple advocacy groups, like Detroit Will Breathe and the Yemeni Liberation Movement, came together for the rally.\n\n“Where our collective power lies is together in these streets in collective struggle,” said Jae Bass, an organizer with Detroit Will Breathe. “It’s all the same fight, we are fighting the same systems of oppression. Zionism is racism, racism is Zionism. Black Americans are being displaced and oppressed by white supremacy and the people of Palestine are being displaced and oppressed by ... Israel.”\n\nThey marched through the south end of Dearborn along Dix Road, a neighborhood that is more than 90% Arab American Muslim and home to the Ford Rouge plant.\n\nHome and business owners stood outside to watch and cheer on the procession — a mixed demographic with children and grandparents, Arabs and non-Arabs — through the neighborhood.\n\n“The anger that is being sustained in Dearborn toward Biden is (due to) his sheer disregard and lack of attention to what’s happening right now in real time in Palestine,” said Sahar Faraj, an organizer with the Palestinian Youth Movement. “For the people of Dearborn, for Biden to approve the sale of $735 million in weapons funding for Israel, then come to the largest population of Arabs in America? Yeah he’s going to hear that.\"\n\nThey held up signs that read: \"Joe Biden loves genocide” and “Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crimes.\"\n\nSupporters of Israel held a rally on Friday in West Bloomfield, saying that the country has the right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks and violence from some Palestinian extremists in Jerusalem. Biden has repeatedly defended Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas.\n\nAt the rally at the police station Tuesday, former Detroit health director and former candidate for governor Abdul El-Sayed told the crowd that as a public health expert, he was particularly upset to see Israel attack a COVID-19 testing lab.\n\n\"As an American, I am unwilling to watch my country, watch my tax dollars get spent for that any longer,\" El-Sayed said. \"Today, we are standing up to tell the Biden administration that enough is enough, that if you believe in haman rights, you better stand for human rights. ... Today, the rights of the Palestinian people are being denied. Who knows who it's going to be tomorrow.\"\n\nLate Tuesday, about 60 pro-Palestinian protesters marched in Detroit.\n\nSpeakers at the rallies said they are planning more protests and political activity in the coming days.\n\nPhotojournalists Antranik Tavitian and Kimberly P.

That amount is said to produce a mild intoxication for nonregular users.\n\n“One of the highest quality studies included in our publication found that use of high potency cannabis, compared to low potency cannabis, was linked to a four-fold increased risk of addiction,” said study coauthor Tom Freeman, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology and director of the addiction and mental health group at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, in an email.\n\nIn the United States, about 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have cannabis use disorder, the medical term for marijuana addiction, according to the US Centers for Disease and Prevention.\n\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction found a 76% rise in people entering treatment for cannabis addiction over the past decade, “while cannabis potency continued to rise during the same time,” Freeman said.\n\nIn addition, “a report by the United Nations found that in the past two decades, the proportion of people seeking treatment for cannabis addiction has risen in all world regions apart from Africa,” he said.\n\nA yearly rise in potency\n\nIn a gram of herbal cannabis, the dried and harvested tops of female marijuana plants that are typically smoked, THC concentrations increased by approximately 2.9 milligrams each year, according to a 2020 study by Freeman and his team at the University of Bath.\n\nThe potency of marijuana has been increasing every year since the 1970s, studies have found. Adobe Stock\n\nIn cannabis resin, the sticky brown sap on the plant from which extracts and concentrations are made, THC levels increased by approximately 5.7 milligrams each year from 1975 to 2017, the study found. Concentrated products can reach extremely high levels of THC.\n\nThis yearly rise in potency may not be clear to consumers, experts fear. While looking at a product label might tell a person the “precise potency” of THC in a store where marijuana is legally sold, “people buying cannabis illegally may not be able to access reliable information about the potency of the product they are using,” Freeman said.\n\n“However, certain types of cannabis are typically more potent than others – cannabis extracts are typically more potent than cannabis flower,” he added.\n\nWhile people do try to adjust their consumption when the potency of their cannabis varies, “such as by adding less cannabis to their joint or inhaling less deeply,” these efforts fail to completely work, Freeman said. That means “higher potency products still deliver a larger dose of THC to consumers than lower potency products,” he said.\n\nMental health affected\n\nAs marijuana became more potent, cases of marijuana-associated psychosis rose, the review found. Psychosis is a “loss of contact with reality” that can be characterized by hearing voices and having delusions, Freeman said.\n\n“The evidence linking cannabis potency to addiction and psychosis was very clear,” he said.\n\nHigh-potency weed users appear to have a significant increase in the likelihood of developing generalized anxiety disorder than those who smoke less robust strains of marijuana, a 2020 study had found.\n\nHowever, the new review of studies found a “more varied” connection between the increase in marijuana potency and depression and anxiety, “meaning that the impact is unclear for these other mental health outcomes,” Freeman said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/04/16/keto-diet-explained-foods-benefits-risks-how-it-works-ketogenic/3441775002/", "title": "Keto Diet explained: Foods, benefits, risks, and is it right for you?", "text": "Orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Brian Bixler helps young people recover from sports-related injuries. He typically sees patients under the age of 21.\n\nBixler has specialized training in sports medicine and pediatric orthopaedics.\n\nBut when he began his most recent talk on the ketogenic lifestyle, or keto diet, the individuals in his audience looked very different than his typical patients.\n\nAbout 100 people, most of them over the age of 40, crowded into a conference room looking for more information on a ketogenic or keto diet.\n\nCould this be the answer to some of their health concerns?\n\nEarly on, Bixler, of OSS Health, would point out this is not a diet. This was a lifestyle choice, an eating plan and one he made only after turning 50 and realizing he had metabolic syndrome — he had all five factors that placed him at risk of developing diabetes, suffering a stroke or developing heart disease.\n\nHe was gaining weight year after year despite running five times a week and eating a low-fat diet, the type of diet he thought would keep him healthy.\n\nFinding out he was at risk was crushing because of his family history.\n\nHis father — who was a general surgeon — died of a heart attack at age 44. Bixler's grandfather, his father's father, then died three weeks later of a heart attack.\n\nFinding a way to improve his own health goes back to the family history he knows all too well.\n\n\"Both of them were practicing physicians when they died of heart attacks,\" Bixler said. \"So I want to be the first doctor in my family to retire before I die.\"\n\nFinding keto\n\nThrough searching the internet, Bixler learned about the keto diet or lifestyle. It flew in the face of everything he thought he knew about nutrition and eating healthy.\n\n\"It was like opposite day,\" Bixler said. \"I went from eating high carbs to low carbs to almost no carbs. I went from low fat to high fat everything: full-fat milk, fatty cuts of meat. I cut down running and started lifting weights again, and I started dropping weight like crazy.\n\n\"And basically everything turned around (in about a year), so my blood pressure went to normal and all my labs went to normal.\"\n\nBesides his semi-regular speaking schedule around central Pennsylvania, he posts on Facebook under Bixler Functional Health Coaching.\n\n\"I'm not dieting, I'm not starving — I eat a ton of food — I just switched to this (keto),\" Bixler said.\n\nWhat is a ketogenic lifestyle, diet?\n\nKetogenic is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan.\n\nThe goal is to put your body in a state of ketosis, where your body will break down stored fat into ketones to burn for energy. In other words, instead of burning sugar and carbs for fuel your body will burn fat.\n\nKeto calls for restricting carbs between 50 and 20 grams.\n\nThat's not going to be easy for most people.\n\n\"A lot of us have a really bad sugar addiction, the biggest obstacle to overcome to do this right is you need to get rid of that sweet tooth,\" Bixler said.\n\nHe knows he's talking to an audience that has consumed processed food and carbohydrates in large quantities and has done so for decades. He was in a similar position several years ago.\n\n\"For you to do this, it's a mind game,\" Bixler said. \"We have been told for so long that we shouldn't eat fat and we're going to die, so for you to get over it's really, really hard.\"\n\nAccepted foods in keto\n\n• eggs\n\n• beef, pork, bacon, turkey, fish, shellfish\n\n• avocados\n\n• whole milk yogurt (NOT low-fat, high-sugar yogurt)\n\n• tree nuts\n\n• seeds\n\n• heavy cream\n\n• cheese\n\n• butter\n\n• coffee (without sweetener)\n\n• olive oil\n\n• coconut oil\n\n• leafy green vegetables\n\n• almond flour, coconut flour\n\nRestrictions in keto\n\n• sugar\n\n• grains (cereals, bread, pasta, oats, rice, quinoa)\n\n• starchy vegetables (corn, potatoes and sweet potatoes)\n\n• sugary drinks (soda, sports drinks, fruit juices)\n\n• fruits (bananas, pears, mango, citrus)\n\n• legumes (beans, hummus, lenils)\n\n• alcohol\n\nWhat's the difference between keto, Atkins, Paleo?\n\nKetogenic might sound like some other diets that have become popular during the last 40 years.\n\nLike Atkins and Paleo, keto stresses eliminating high-carbohydrate consumption, but there are differences in the three.\n\nKeto is a high fat and moderate protein diet.\n\nPaleo focuses on the types of foods eaten, not the amount. While many of the foods are similar — calling for a restriction of dairy, grains, legumes, refined sugar, salt, potatoes and all high-processed foods — a Paleo diet won't necessarily put you in a ketogenic state.\n\nAtkins was billed as a diet and not a lifestyle change, limiting the amounts of carbs in phases before reintroducing carbs into an everyday diet after a weight-loss goal was met.\n\nMore:Paleo, Atkins and keto are all low-carb diets, so what's the difference?\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nDepending on how strict an individual restricts carbs, keto has shown the potential for weight loss.\n\nIt can also improve insulin resistance, meaning it could be a great aid for people who have pre-diabetes (more than 1 in 3 adults).\n\nIn Bixler's case, his HDL (good cholesterol) improved, his high blood pressure dropped and he lost weight — in his 50s. He remarked he's not selling anything. He has a day job, but he is a proponent of the keto lifestyle.\n\n\"This same program has ridiculous health benefits ... we are finding that most of our chronic diseases now are caused by a combination of too-high insulin levels in the blood and inflammation,\" Bixler said. \"And so anything you can do to control those two things, can control all of these diseases.\"\n\nWhat are the dangers?\n\nBixler did not hesitate, people with diabetes and people with high blood pressure need to consult with their doctor before going on a keto diet, because if done correctly the change in diet can lower blood pressure and insulin levels.\n\nHe understands not every physician knows the benefits of keto or have researched it.\n\nRegistered dietitian Julie Stefanski is based in York and has specialized in the ketogenic diet for more than a decade. She also advocates for anyone starting keto, especially individuals who have not seen a doctor in more than a year, to first see a physician and/or registered dietitian to have their lab work checked and monitored. She also notes there are certain medications that cannot be used while on a ketogenic diet.\n\n\"A high fat diet is not always tolerated, especially if you already have digestive issues, have had gallbladder surgery or liver problems,\" Stefanski said.\n\n\"A very high fat diet can have unpredictable effects on a person's cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ... For some people, these levels can get extremely high. If a physician is not monitoring this, you'll never feel that these changes are occurring.\"\n\nFiber and calcium, or the lack of fiber and calcium, in a keto diet could also become an issue, Stefanski said. Keto-friendly calcium foods, like sardines and salmon, eaten on a regular basis could help bone health.\n\n\"There are ways to add fiber to a ketogenic diet, but it's not possible to come close to the fiber amounts recommended by health experts for fighting cancer and for gastrointestinal health,\" Stefanski said. \"Keto diets often lack good sources of prebiotic fibers known to best support our gut bacteria.\"\n\nEveryone also seems to agree keto newcomers can suffer from cutting down on sugar and carbs. Some call it the keto flu. Headaches, sluggishness and constipation can occur.\n\nDehydration can be common if individuals don't drink enough water.\n\nAnd if you've ever heard of dragon breath, get ready for keto breath.\n\nIs it sustainable?\n\nOne knock against keto is the difficulty in sustaining a diet that limits carbs indefinitely. If it's a life plan, there are no built-in days for cheating. There are substitute foods (pork rinds instead of crunchy snacks like potato chips), but Bixler has kept to the diet plan for years.\n\nHis driving force has been focusing on why he started.\n\n\"If you want to do this bad enough, you can,\" Bixler said. \"I want to be heathy more than I want to eat a bowl of ice cream. I want to be healthy more than I want the three-minute satisfaction of eating ice cream.\"\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, Stefanski said: Long-term studies on keto are lacking.\n\n\"When we look at the individuals in the world that are living the longest — areas like Okinawa, Japan — these people don't consume extremely high fat diets,\" Stefanski said. \"Their diets are low in processed foods, high in fiber and moderate in both protein and fat.\"\n\nExpect plenty of critics\n\nLike all diets, individuals can make mistakes in implementing a new eating plan, including not drinking enough water or ingesting enough salt or electrolytes.\n\nThis could be an issue with some athletes.\n\n\"Keto completely changes the stored fuel that's available for athletes to compete,\" Stefanski said. \"For sports like sprinting, which rely on sugar stored in the muscles to fuel the activity, performance can be significantly affected without enough carbs in the diet.\"\n\nKeto has some celebrity critics. TV's \"Biggest Loser\" trainer Jillian Michaels ripped the keto diet, telling Women's Health magazine: \"Like, why would anybody think this is a good idea?\" She also said, it's a \"bad plan, for a million reasons.\"\n\nOn her website, however, she posted a more balanced argument, explaining the positive effects of keto, but she also pointed out her concerns including that the dietary restrictions could lead to a lack of vitamins and minerals.\n\n\"You're going to hear this ... a million reasons, like Jillian Michaels said I have 'a million reasons' why a ketogenic diet is a bad idea,\" Bixler said. \"No, she only has one, because she makes money on high-carb, low-fat diet and exercise until you fall over.\"\n\nThere have been others to voice concerns that long-term keto use could lead to osteoporosis or an increase in protein could damage kidneys.\n\n\"So food we've been eating for the entire existence of man is now killing us? That's the premise,\" Bixler said. \"That red meat and fish and eggs and milk is now suddenly dangerous since the 1950s.\"\n\nCan athletes use keto?\n\nTrying to exercise too much while changing a diet can be an issue. There are concerns if keto will work with some athletes.\n\nBixler points out that Tour de France riders and ultramarathon runners practice keto lifestyles. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome has talked about his low-carb diet. Ultrarunner Zach Bitter, the 100-mile American record holder, highlighted why he eats almost no carbs in an interview with Men's Journal.\n\nIn the case of a world-class ultrarunner, Bitter explained how he consumes carbs during certain portions of his training.\n\nIn a peak training week, when Bitter's performing two-a-day workouts with grueling speed work, Bitter thought he needed faster fuel (or glycogen). To improve those workouts Bitter explained that he switches off a keto diet for those weeks in a podcast with Joe Rogan. So Bitter will add carbohydrates to his diet to get that \"extra nudge.\"\n\nIn another podcast, \"Ketogenic Ultrarunning,\" Bitter (starting at about 8:30) describes his diet and training in more detail.

Eight acres were scorched in the blaze, officials said.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation sent officials to inspect the highway, and detours have been established in the area to ease traffic. Interstate 10, which runs east to west, has been closed in Los Angeles for at least 24 hours, according to authorities. The cause of the fire hasn't been released.\n\nNo people were reported injured. On Saturday night, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a state of emergency in Los Angeles County to deploy resources to repair the damage caused by the fire and minimize travel impacts for residents.\n\n\"This is one of those heaven and earth moments,\" Newsom said during a news conference Sunday afternoon in which he, Los Angeles City Mayor Karen Bass, and other officials provided updates about the fire. \"This is a 24-7 operation full stop.\"\n\nThe interstate, which runs through the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Santa Ana, serves an average of 355,000 commuters each day and is among the top 25 most traveled locations in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nOngoing investigation into the cause of the blaze\n\nNewsom said it is unknown when the freeway section will reopen but that he is aware of the impacts on schools and vulnerable communities. He said he is mindful of the urgency to reopen the freeway.\n\n\"We know the impact this fire will have on the surrounding communities as people need to drive to school, work and other activities,\" Bass said Sunday. \"We are working day and night to make the repairs necessary to restore the freeway.\"\n\nThe blaze erupted in an industrial area, and no homes were damaged, officials said Sunday. Bass said about 16 unhoused people evacuated the area when the fire broke out but that there might be more displaced people.\n\nBass said she spoke with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on Saturday who assured her that federal resources will be available to help during the emergency.\n\nCaltrans expects to complete its investigation into the cause of the fire by 6 a.m. Monday after structural engineers assess the damage to the freeway columns and the bridge deck, Newsom said during the news conference. Newsom added that \"unless anything significant occurs,\" investigators may have an update then.\n\n\"I’m not going to understate the challenge here,\" California Transportation Secretary Toks Omishakin said Sunday. \"It is significant … so this is not going to be an easy task for our structural engineers at Caltrans.\"\n\nThe governor did not provide many details about the investigation but said property owners were in violation of a lease, and officials are in current litigation.\n\nStay in the know:Sign up for the Daily Briefing morning newsletter.\n\nNewsom: LA freeway damage 'substantially greater' than I-95 collapse\n\nNewsom on Sunday compared the emergency to the June collapse of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, which was caused by a massive tanker truck fire that shut down the corridor in both directions.\n\n\"The scale of this is substantially greater; the question is: Is the damage substantially more problematic,\" he said during the press conference.\n\nPhiladelphia commuters faced delays, detours, and travel chaos in the days after the gasoline-hauling tractor-trailer flipped on an I-95 off-ramp on June 11. The damaged portion of the section was reopened ahead of schedule less than two weeks after the incident with six temporary lanes.\n\nNewsom said emergency efforts are informed by best practices Pennsylvania officials mobilized in response to the disaster.\n\nAt least 16 homeless people living underneath the highway were evacuated and brought to shelters, Bass said. Officials said there was no immediate indication that the blaze began at the encampment.\n\nThe mayor said the fire’s long-term impact could be reminiscent of damage from the Northridge earthquake that flattened freeways in 1994.\n\n“Unfortunately, there is no reason to think that this is going to be over in a couple of days,” she said.\n\nAlternate routes recommended\n\nDoug Young, an assistant chief with the California Highway Patrol, said this section of I-10 is \"one of the largest arteries\" going in and out of Los Angeles. He said to expect long-term closures with officials providing daily updates on any changes to traffic routes.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Emergency Management Department, the I-10 is closed in both directions, south of Downtown Los Angeles between the 110 Freeway and Alameda Street. Officials encouraged commuters to take alternate routes or use public transit options to avoid the closure entirely as repair work continues.\n\n\"Plan ahead for that Monday morning commute,\" the Los Angeles City Emergency Management Department advised on Sunday. \"Check Metro Los Angeles for public transit options, or - if able - work from home until central area traffic impacts can be better assessed.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/11/interstate-95-philadelphia-collapse/70310677007/", "title": "Busy I-95 collapsed in Philadelphia: Full rebuild to take 'months'", "text": "A tanker truck fire shut down I-95 in both directions after an elevated portion of the heavily traveled interstate collapsed in Philadelphia on Sunday morning, state officials said, raising concerns about possible travel headaches throughout the Northeast.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said the fire closed all lanes between Exit 25 and Exit 32, which includes Allegheny Avenue, Castor Avenue, Academy Road, and Linden Avenue.\n\nPhiladelphia Fire Department Captain Derek Bowmer said emergency crews responded shortly before 6:30 a.m. local time after receiving a report of a vehicle being on fire on the interstate. Authorities later identified the vehicle as a gasoline tanker truck that may have been carrying hundreds of gallons of gasoline.\n\nThe fire took about an hour to get under control. City and state officials are \"responding to address impacts to residents in the area and travelers affected by the road closure,\" the state fire department said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nIn a Sunday night update, Pennsylvania Gov.

Pete Buttigieg said he was monitoring the fire and collapse and was in touch with the governor and Federal Highway Administration to offer \"help with recovery and reconstruction.\" And the National Transportation Safety Board said it was working with the Pennsylvania State Police to conduct a safety investigation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was also briefed on the collapse and officials offered assistance to local and state authorities, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nHow did the section of I-95 in Philadelphia collapse?\n\nTransportation Department spokesperson Brad Rudolph said some kind of crash occurred on a ramp under northbound I-95 causing the northbound section above the fire to quickly collapse.\n\nBowmer said runoff from the fire or compromised gas lines caused explosions underground. Because of heat from the fire, Bowmer said the northbound lanes were gone and the southbound lanes were \"compromised.\"\n\n\"Today’s going to be a long day. And obviously, with 95 northbound gone and southbound questionable, it’s going to be even longer than that,\" said Dominick Mireles, director of the Philadelphia OEM.\n\nAccording to Rudolph, the collapsed section of I-95 was part of a $212 million reconstruction project that was completed four years ago. The highway segment is closed indefinitely but Rudolph said officials would consider \"a fill-in situation or a temporary structure.\"\n\nWitness describes a 'pretty remarkable' collapse\n\nMark Fusetti was driving south toward the city’s airport when he saw black smoke rising above the highway. The retired Philadelphia police sergeant said the road beneath the fire began to \"dip,\" creating a depression. Traffic soon came to a halt before the northbound lanes of the highway gave way.\n\n\"It was crazy timing,\" Fusetti said. \"For it to buckle and collapse that quickly, it’s pretty remarkable.\"\n\nDetour routes recommended\n\nFor people traveling on I-95 southbound, officials recommended using Route 63 West (Woodhaven Road), U.S. 1 South, 76 East to 676 East. For people traveling I-95 northbound, officials recommended I-676 West, I-76 West, U.S. 1 North to Route 63 East (Woodhaven Road).\n\nPhiladelphia residents should use regional public transits services, such as rapid transit, commuter rail or light rail, the city's Office of Emergency Management said.\n\nFire contents did not appear to spread into environment\n\nConcerns about the environmental effects of runoff into the nearby Delaware River were raised after a sheen was seen in the river near the collapse site. The Coast Guard contained the material by deploying a boom.\n\nWhile the tanker truck had a capacity of 8,500 gallons, Ensign Joshua Ledoux said contents from the fire did not appear to be spreading into the environment and \"it seems like things are under control.\"\n\nThe Philadelphia Water Department said the incident had no impact on drinking water quality but will continue to monitor and work with other agencies in their emergency response.\n\nMireles said heavy construction equipment would be needed to remove the thousands of tons of debris at the site of the fire.\n\nAERIAL VIEW OF DAMAGE:Gov. Shapiro speaks about Route 95 collapse in northeast Philadelphia\n\nDelays in local waste collection expected\n\nResidents in some areas should expect delays in trash and recycling collections, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management said.\n\n\"The Streets Department is assessing which areas will be impacted as sanitation trucks will have to be diverted to alternative travel routes,\" the office said.\n\nHeat from fire can quickly weaken bridge structures, expert says\n\nTanker truck fires carry a large amount of hydrocarbon fuel and can generate a \"fast, intense release of heat,\" said Dr. Thomas Gernay, an assistant professor of civil engineering at Johns Hopkins University who studies ways to protect structures from fires.\n\n\"These fires can exceed temperatures of 1500 F in just a few minutes,\" Gernay said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nHeat from a fire underneath a bridge, which is generally not designed for fire exposure, can quickly weaken structural members, according to Gernay. The materials, such as steel and concrete, of structural members lose load-carry capacity as temperatures increase.\n\nGernay also said structural members will expand when heated and contract when cooled down, further damaging the structure.\n\n\"The parts of the structure that did not collapse can be permanently damaged by the material degradation and the movements induced by the heat exposure,\" Gernay said in an email.\n\nIncident resembles other bridge fire failures\n\nWhile bridge fire failures are rare, according to Gernay, past incidents have been similar and involved a portion of a busy highway collapsing.\n\nIn 2007, the MacArthur Maze connecting ramp in Oakland, California, collapsed after a tank truck carrying 8,600 gallons of unleaded gasoline overturned. And more recently in 2017, an elevated portion of Interstate 85 collapsed in a fire and shut down the heavily traveled route.\n\nGernay said in both cases, contractors had to work ahead of schedule due to the \"economic impact of traffic interruption.\" The timeline of reconstruction of the two cases occurred over several weeks.\n\nShapiro said Sunday night he planned to issue a disaster declaration Monday to speed up federal funds. He said he had spoken with Buttigieg and was assured that there would be \"absolutely no delay\" in getting federal funds to safely reconstruct what he called a \"critical roadway.\"\n\nBut Shapiro also said the complete rebuild of I-95 would take \"some number of months.\"\n\nI-95 accident map\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/09/maui-hawaii-wildfire-live-updates/70556894007/", "title": "Hawaii wildfire updates: 36 dead and over 270 structures damaged", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Wednesday, Aug. 9. For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire and the ongoing evacuations, check out our live updates file for Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\nMAUI, Hawaii − Wind-whipped wildfires in Hawaii forced hundreds of evacuations Wednesday, overwhelmed hospitals and even sent some residents fleeing into the ocean to escape the flames as parts of the popular tourist destination turned into a raging inferno in a matter of hours.\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening. Officials said earlier that 271 structures were damaged or destroyed and dozens of people injured.\n\nEntire blocks of homes and businesses went up in smoke in historic Lahaina Town in Maui, where blazes fueled by wind from a passing hurricane were concentrated. In addition, three wildfires were burning on the Big Island, though two of them were at least 60% contained.\n\nActing Gov. Sylvia Luke said residents had been preparing for Hurricane Dora, which skirted south of the islands, and had no reason to expect the quickly developing blazes.\n\n“We expect rain, sometimes we expect floods,'' she said. \"We never anticipated in this date that a hurricane which did not make impact on our islands would cause these type of wildfires.''\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement he has ordered “all available Federal assets” to help combat the wildfires, including Black Hawk helicopters provided by the Marines.\n\nCounty of Maui spokesperson Mahina Martin told USA TODAY the fires are affecting two areas of the island: Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui, and Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous upcountry region.\n\nOfficials said 2,000 travelers sheltered at Maui's Kahului Airport, and another 4,000 visitors wanted to leave the island. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLocals and visitors scrambled to get information and reach loved ones amid power blackouts and downed cellular and 911 service as well as phone lines in different parts of the islands.\n\nTiare Lawrence, who grew up in Lahaina, was trying to get in touch with her siblings while providing refuge at her home for 14 cousins and uncles who fled the heat, smoke and flames in Lahaina.\n\n“It was apocalyptic from what they explained,” she said.\n\nMaui county officials said multiple structures have burned and multiple evacuation orders are in place as emergency crews battle brush and structure fires. \"It's been an unprecedented incident striking large areas of our island, and it has been pretty much all hands on deck,\" Martin said.\n\nTourists turning around and leaving right after arriving\n\nThe sky over west Maui is hazy with smoke from the devastating wildfires still burning on the island, which continue to displace thousands.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, traffic was at a complete standstill on Honoapiilani Highway, the main road to access Lahaina, as it remains closed. Cars packed with people are parked along the side of the road waiting to return to their hotels or homes, but no time or date has been given yet.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 4,000 people − including residents and tourists from two hotels − evacuated to emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross. On Wednesday, the organization said it was flying in additional volunteers and staff from the mainland to assist with the aftermath of the fires and get people safely to Oahu.Tourists arriving at Kahului Airport are turning around and trying to leave Maui. Alexis and Hector Palomar had their trip planned since May and landed on Wednesday morning.\n\n“We didn’t realize it was happening until we were on our way to the airport. We didn’t think it was that bad until we got here,” Hector Palomar said.\n\nThey immediately changed plans and booked a flight to Kauai, departing just three hours after they arrived on Maui.“Thankfully we’re able to get out,” he said. “I just don’t want to take resources from the locals since it’s an island.”\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'Everything is gone': Resident feels lucky, mournful after Lahaina escape\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay knew how fortunate he and his family were to escape the flames around them alive, having merely lost items that could be replaced.\n\nSaribay had seen homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them,’’ debris turn into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas trying to flee while carrying their prized possessions.\n\n“Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,’’ Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.’’\n\nAnd much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey of trying to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat that caused another car to explode, injuring a woman inside it.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina on his rear-view mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. “Just praying that a miracle happens,’’ he said.\n\n− Ashley Lewis\n\nGovernor has contacted White House, says 'loss of life is expected'\n\nGov. Josh Green said in a statement Wednesday that he expects to request a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the White House in the next 36 to 48 hours once officials have a better understanding of the scope of the damage.\n\nGreen was planning to be out of state for personal travel until next week but is expected to return Wednesday night to address the crisis. He said while the \"heroic efforts\" of first responders have prevented many causalities, \"some loss of life is expected.\"\n\n“Our state appreciates the incredible outpouring of concern and prayers from the mainland. We won’t forget the aloha you have already begun to share with us,” Green said.\n\nLifelong Maui resident had 'never seen anything like this'\n\nKyle Ellison, born and raised in Maui, returned to his Kula home Wednesday morning and started stomping out flames on the property.\n\nThe previous morning, he heard trees fall down into the gulch behind his house and, when a popping sound went off, he figured it was coming from an electrical transformer.\n\n\"A minute later, I ask my wife if the internet is out and if she can smell smoke.\" Ellison said. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this. I have friends in Lahaina who have lost everything.\"\n\nEllison and his family made it out with one truck full of belongings. Their house is still standing but their neighbors' is not. His wife and children went to the houses of three different friends to stay the night but kept having to move as evacuations spread.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of people hurting,'' he said. \"We already have a housing crisis out here and we lost so many more homes.''\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHawaii National Guard activated\n\nLuke and Bissen have issued emergency proclamations in response to the fire. The Hawaii National Guard has been activated and is assisting the Maui Police Department at traffic control points, according to the Hawaii adjutant general.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Hurricane Dora, which was passing 500 miles south of the island chain, and a very strong high pressure north of the state produced powerful, damaging winds through the overnight hours.\n\n\"Very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\" the weather service said in a red flag warning for leeward areas issued Wednesday.\n\n'Chaos' trying to find shelter as people left with few possessions\n\nPeople in Lahaina described frantically trying to get to relative safety in one of the nearby emergency shelters. But they weren’t told by anyone where to go – just that they had to leave.\n\nThroughout the night, people were driving aimlessly and following other cars, just trying to head north, as police and firefighters dealt with growing flames.\n\nThe War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku opened to evacuees this morning. There is no capacity limit to how many people can stay there. The community has set up cots and are giving away clothing, food and pillows to evacuees. A medical team is checking for burns and smoke inhalation, and to aid anyone with existing conditions without access to medication.\n\nMauro Farinelli and his wife Judit arrived at the shelter around noon. They have lived right on Front Street in Lahaina for four years and described their evacuation as “chaos.”\n\n“No one told us we had to leave, it was getting bad and we had to leave with the clothes on our back,” he said. The couple went to the boat ramp where they were told they could jump into the ocean “if things got bad.” Farinelli said he can’t return home until the electric wires are assessed in Lahaina.\n\n“Nobody thinks it can happen to them,” he said. “Where I lived, it was like there’s no way a fire can get here because I’m not close to vegetation but the wind was so strong, it was like a blow torch.\"\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'We just lost a large part of our heritage,' official says\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran cited various landmarks that have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and buildings, temples and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui. Lahaina, where the largest fires are concentrated, was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nBrush and wildfires are not unheard of in Hawaii’s leeward regions during the dry season. In 2018, Maui suffered a massive brush fire on the same side of the island, primarily on the slopes. “This is so much worse,” Keith-Agaran said, pointing to the scope of the current blaze.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, you’re not going to be ready for something that moves as quickly and as big as this,” he said. “I don’t think we had enough equipment or people to be fighting fires upcountry, small fires in central Maui and then this huge fire on the west side.”\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nBurn victims sent to other islands\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey, who was not aware of any deaths.\n\nLuke told CNN Maui's hospitals are overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation and it's been difficult to transport people needing care to other facilities.\n\n“We are already in communication with other hospital systems about relieving the burden – the reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment,” Luke said. “In addition to dealing with disaster, we're dealing with major transportation issues as well.”\n\nResident of nearby island searching for family in Maui\n\nLeomana Turalde's mother called him on the phone crying Wednesday morning, saying she never went to sleep on Tuesday night in Maui amid the massive fires.\n\nTuralde said he has several “aunties” who live on Maui, two blocks away from Lahaina’s popular Front Street. Wednesday morning, one of the women went missing, he told USA TODAY. It is impossible to get in touch with some people because cellphone infrastructure on Maui burned down, he said.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burnt down to ashes,'' said Turalde, 36, who runs a sunscreen company. \"Most of the families on Maui, if you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you’re still trying to figure out where they are.”\n\nHe said he is boarding a plane on Wednesday to Maui from where he lives on the island of Hawaii to help family members search for missing relatives near their homestead property, which he said burned down.\n\n“I’m going to go to the first place that everybody would go to when they’re in trouble, and that’s the house, even though the house isn’t there,” he said. “Home is usually the first place you should start if people are missing.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nAll roads to historic Lahaina closed as Front Street burns\n\nAll roads into Lahaina, a town of roughly 13,000, and West Maui have been closed to public use, except for emergency services, county officials said Wednesday. Photos shared by the county overnight showed a line of flames blazing across an intersection in Lahaina and flames leaping above buildings in the town, whose historic district is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"Do NOT go to Lahaina town,\" officials warned.\n\nGreen said much of the area \"has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced.\"\n\nFront Street business owner Alan Dickar told CBS News buildings on both sides of the street in the popular tourist area were engulfed in flames. Dickar said it appeared the fire department was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Maui can't handle this,\" Dickar said. \"A lot of people just lost their jobs because a lot of businesses burned. A lot of people lost their homes. ... This is going to be devastating for Maui.\"\n\nLahaina’s historic Waiola Church and the neighboring Lahaina Hongwanji Mission temple were among the structures that caught fire Wednesday, the Maui News reported. The church was established in 1823, and its graveyard, believed to be the first Christian cemetery in Hawaii, is the final resting place for early members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, according to its website.\n\nUncertainty for many residents\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we was going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.” The ocean was black and eerie.\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes. But local residents lose their homes.\n\nShe’s worried about what’s next now that the shelter is gone but she’s thankful for her family’s safety.\n\n“You can lose everything but you cannot replace a life,\" she said.\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui fires map\n\nTrack the latest wildfire and red flag warnings here with data that is updated based on input from several incident and intelligence sources.\n\nNearly 2,000 people stuck at Maui airport\n\nMartin said the Kahului Airport in Maui has more than 2,000 visitors who have either canceled flights or had nowhere to go. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said Wednesday that about 1,800 people sheltered in place overnight in the airport with many highways on the island's west site still closed.\n\n\"HDOT worked with airlines/TSA to shelter passengers for safety's sake as wildfires continue to burn in Lahaina and upcountry,\" officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNearly 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, county officials said.\n\nTen public schools in Maui were closed Wednesday, including one that is being used as an evacuation shelter, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.\n\nStudent boarders at Lahainaluna High School were moved Tuesday evening to Maui High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees to be picked up by family members or emergency contacts, officials said. The Lahainaluna campus remained closed Wednesday because of a lack of power, wind damage and brush fire evacuations.\n\nAs the brush fire spread to Kihei, officials announced Tuesday that four public schools in South Maui would be closed in addition to schools in West, Upcountry and Central Maui.\n\nHomes destroyed; residents evacuated\n\nThe Coast Guard has been responding to areas where residents are \"entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\" county officials said. A Coast Guard boat rescued 12 people from the waters off Lahaina, officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nLawrence told Hawaii News Now people were running for their lives. She said the homes of everyone she knows in Lahaina have been down.\n\n“It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said.\n\nIn Kula, at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres, Bissen told The Associated Press. About 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, he said.\n\nThe Red Cross has opened several emergency shelters for residents. Martin said one evacuation center alone had more than 1,200 people.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain they are very anxious at our evacuation centers,\" she said.\n\nLocal resident could tell something was brewing\n\nAlice Carillo lives about five miles from the fire that erupted in Kula, in a hilly, bucolic region of Maui known as upcountry.\n\nThe 79-year-old woke up in the middle of the night Tuesday to the smell of something burning. She opened the door of her Makawao plantation home, where she’s lived for more than half a century, and “it was like fog out there, so covered with smoke.” She could see a fire above the Kula shopping center.\n\n10 schools closed, including one converted to evacuation shelter\n\nConditions had been especially windy in the days leading up to the blaze, in part because of Hurricane Dora moving south of the island. Carillo could sense something was brewing as the gusts picked up.

County officials advised residents to stay at least 30 feet from downed power lines, which at one point restricted travel along parts of Honoapiilani Highway. Part of the highway was reopened Tuesday evening to allow access in and out of Lahaina, but motorists were told to expect traffic to move slowly through the bypass.\n\nIn West Maui, 911 service is no longer available. Martin said it's been \"very difficult\" to manage evacuation orders in Lahaina because the area does not have cell service and only landlines are functioning.\n\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nStrong winds are fueling the flames\n\nIn Kula, winds were recorded at 80 mph, \"which greatly affected the speed and the movement of the fire,\" Martin said.\n\nBecause of the wind gusts, helicopters weren’t able to dump water on the fires from the sky – or gauge more precise fire sizes – and firefighters were encountering roads blocked by downed trees and power lines as they worked the inland fires, Martin previously told the Associated Press.\n\nA high wind warning and red flag warning for dangerous fire weather issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nMaui fire officials warned that erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes and dropping humidity combined with the direction and the location of the fire have made it difficult to predict its path and speed. The wind can also sends fire embers up and ignite sparks downwind, creating fires far from their source, officials said.\n\n“The fire can be a mile or more from your house, but in a minute or two, it can be at your house,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea. “Burning airborne materials can light fires a great distance away from the main body of fire.”\n\nFires also burning on the Big Island\n\nHawaii County officials said Tuesday that they were monitoring two brush fires burning in North and South Kohala. The fires prompted evacuations and power outages in the area.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday approved the state's request for a disaster declaration to provide assistance with \"the wind-whipped Kohala Ranch wildfire on the Big Island,\" according to a news release from the governor's office.\n\nThe fire, which began early Tuesday, threatened about 200 homes near the rural community of Kohala Ranch, a volunteer fire department, local electrical transmission lines and an AT&T cellular communications tower in the area, officials said The fire was uncontained and had burned more than 600 acres of land when the request for federal assistance was made.\n\nThe release said firefighters battling that fire and the two other uncontrolled fires on the Big Island and Maui \"have been hampered by the winds, which made it impossible to provide aircraft support for their efforts to contain the flames.\"\n\n“We’re trying to protect homes in the community,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said of evacuating about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island. As of Tuesday, the roof of one house caught on fire, he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/12/24/how-tenet-highway-car-chase-closed-estonias-main-highway/3917950001/", "title": "How 'Tenet' highway car chase closed Estonia's main highway", "text": "One of the most jaw-dropping scenes in writer-director Christopher Nolan's \"Tenet\" is an impossibly elaborate car chase involving time travel, cars driven in reverse, real explosions and star John David Washington crawling out on the ladder of a moving fire truck.\n\nThe elaborate scenes required shutting down one of the main highways in Estonia, closing nearly four miles of the Laagna Tee highway around the country's capital Tallinn during shooting last July.\n\nYou'd think drivers in the former Soviet republic might hold a \"Tenet\" grudge.\n\n\"You might think so,\" says Nolan. \"But it turns out that 'Tenet' is the most successful film in the history of Estonia. So I think they were OK with it.\"\n\n\"Tenet\" (available on Blu-ray and streaming in the U.S.) broke the Estonian box-office record for international film with $1.2 million, with 266,000 people from the small country's population of just 1.3 million seeing the film.\n\nChristopher Nolan on 'Tenet':Secrets behind the film\n\nThe highway shutdown was unprecedented for Nolan, who has overseen major traffic stoppages for action sequences before, such as when he closed Chicago's Lower Wacker Drive (at night) to film memorable scenes for 2008's \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nNolan was blown way by the effort during the Estonia shoot, which was akin to shutting down Los Angeles' busy 405 freeway.\n\n\"To go to a city and say, 'Look, in the middle of the day, we want to close down your busiest highway for three weeks,' \" says Nolan. \"But they went with it. We really had the run of that road throughout the day and staged some very extreme stunts where we had to clear the whole area.\"\n\nNele Paves, commissioner of the Estonian Film Institute, says over e-mail, \"It really is one of our main highways, closed during the height of summer. But Estonians are so proud of the film, accompanied by such excitement and media frenzy. People were interviewed in the cinemas saying they are going to go see it twice, as the first time they were distracted looking at the Estonian locations and had a hard time following the actual plot.\"\n\nThe highway scenes included Kenneth Branagh walking away from a car explosion, Robert Pattinson at the wheel of a car driven in reverse by a stunt driver in the back seat, and several trucks rolling in formation down the highway. The fire truck seen with Washington required special attention.\n\n\"There were all kinds of conversations before we actually shot the scene, how tall is this truck, how low are the (oncoming) bridges, do we need to let air out of the tires? But it all fit,\" says Nolan. \"We were able to put together a sequence that looks incredibly hazardous. It wasn't easy to film, but it was very safe to film.\"\n\nNolan also raved about the 3,000 local Estonian extras who played concertgoers in the action film's opening scene, shot in the Soviet-era Linnahall. The extras, most in their first Hollywood movie, portrayed audience members under attack by commandos, knocked out instantly by sleeping gas.\n\n\"They did an incredible job,\" says Nolan. \"There's the choreography of them all succumbing to the gas and falling asleep in a big wave. Then they had to pretend to be unconscious while gunfire is going off around them, with very loud blanks and explosions. Nobody stirred. There were actors climbing over them and the backs of the seats at points. But we didn't have to edit around anyone. They were really remarkable extras.\"\n\nThe extras endured a week's worth of often tedious shooting. Normally with a scene like that, extras excitedly attend Day 1. \"And then, when they see how boring filming can be, they don't turn up the next day,\" says Nolan. \"But these guys were committed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/07/16/rabbit-fire-stays-7600-acres-crews-hope-to-contain-it-by-wednesday/70418096007/", "title": "Rabbit Fire stays 7,600 acres; crews hope to contain it by Wednesday", "text": "The Rabbit Fire near Beaumont, the largest of four wildfires burning in Riverside County amid the weekend's extreme heat, continued to burn Sunday but wasn't growing, fire officials said.\n\nThe fire remained at 7,600 acres and was 10% contained, according to a Sunday morning update from CalFire.

The Pipeline Station, located at the corner of Pipeline Road and Rainbow Avenue, is capable of pumping 50 million gallons of wastewater per day.\n\nThe strike damaged a 600 horsepower motor on one of the three pumps at the station and occurred at the height of the storm when flows within the system were extremely high.\n\nThe heavy flow and damaged motor created a situation that caused two 300,000-gallon excess flow tanks at the Pipeline Station to fill to capacity and begin discharging from overflow ports at the top of the tanks. In response, ECUA crews redirected the heavy flows to additional excess flow storage tanks. This provided enough relief at the station to abate overflows from the original tanks.\n\nThe estimated gallons of spillage was 525,030, a detail that was omitted from an ECUA news release on the incident but reported to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and included in the DEP's public notice of pollution.\n\nThe overflows began at approximately 4:30 a.m., according to ECUA officials, and continued until shortly after 8 a.m.\n\nRepairs at The Pipeline Station are expected to be completed today.\n\nPensacola Mayor D.C.

Watch radar, stay informed of watches, warnings issued for Pensacola\n\nThe National Weather Service's official account of the April 2014 flood estimates that more than 20 inches of rain fell at the Pensacola International Airport in 48 hours from April 28 to April 30. But that's only an estimate as a power outage during the storm forced the weather service to rely on radar readings to estimate the rainfall.\n\nTwo years after the floods, Escambia County estimated that 22 inches of rain fell within 29 hours, putting the event between a 100-year and 200-year flood.\n\nA 100-year rain event for much of the Pensacola area is defined as 16 inches of rain in a 24-hour period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meaning there's a 1% chance each year that 16 inches will occur in a 24-hour period.\n\nOne person killed in Pensacola tornado\n\nEscambia County Fire Rescue and Emergency Medical services responded to a call at the 500 block of Coker Lane at 8:38 p.m. where the person was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Escambia County spokesperson Andie Gibson.\n\nAnother tornado was confirmed in Gulf Breeze, where it moved west and crossed Santa Rosa Island at the western end of Pensacola Beach.

Vehicles loaded with bikes, camping gear and hauling boats snaked through thick, brown air that smelled of campfire while police and other emergency vehicles whizzed by.\n\nConditions continued to worsen across the northern Sierra. Low humidity and gusty winds were expected to challenge firefighters urgently working to keep the blaze away from the popular vacation spot featuring picturesque beaches, emerald-blue waters, rocky shorelines and stunning landscapes in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n“There is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before. The critical thing for the public to know is evacuate early,” said Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “For the rest of you in California: Every acre can and will burn someday in this state.”\n\nThe blaze was one of 85 large fires and complexes across the country and one of 13 in California alone, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The fires currently burning have scorched more than 3,900 square miles, or 2.5 million acres, across the country.\n\nThe ongoing blazes caused Department of Agriculture forest officials to close all of California's national forests to visitors for at least two weeks in hopes of both helping fire crews get a handle on spiraling crises and avoid tourists from getting trapped or causing new fires.\n\n“We do not take this decision lightly but this is the best choice for public safety,” said Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien. “It is especially hard with the approaching Labor Day weekend when so many people enjoy our national forests.”\n\nThe forests will be closed from Tuesday to at least Sept. 17.\n\nThe evacuation order due to the Caldor Fire covers almost the entire city of South Lake Tahoe and the surrounding area. The fire containment line was about 10 miles south from the lake.\n\nAs the fire burned around Highway 50 to the west, residents were told to head east toward Nevada. Photos showed roads jammed with residents and tourists, who frequent the scenic freshwater lake in the summertime, anxious to flee the area. Officials urged those leaving to remain calm.\n\nRelated:South Lake Tahoe, usually bustling now, is empty and choking on smoke from the Caldor Fire\n\nMore on Caldor Fire:Sisolak declares emergency, Highway 50 packed as thousands flee South Lake Tahoe\n\n“This is a systematic evacuation, one neighborhood at a time,\" South Lake Tahoe police Lt. Travis Cabral said on social media. “I am asking you as our community to please remain calm.”\n\nThe fire destroyed multiple homes Sunday along Highway 50, one of the main routes to the south end of the lake. The fire also roared through the Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort, destroying some buildings but leaving the main buildings at the base intact.\n\nBy Monday night the fire had crossed state highways 50 and 89 and burned mountain cabins as it churned down slopes toward the Tahoe Basin. Flames came within just a few miles of South Lake Tahoe and residents of communities just over the state line in Douglas County, Nevada were warned to get ready to evacuate.\n\nKen Breslin was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic less than a mile from his home, with only a quarter-tank of gas in his Ford Escape. His son begged him to leave Sunday night, but he shrugged him off, certain that if an evacuation order came, it would be later in the week.\n\n“Before, it was, ‘No worries ... it’s not going to crest. It’s not gonna come down the hill. There’s 3,500 firefighters, all those bulldozers and all the air support,’” he said. “Until this morning, I didn’t think there was a chance it could come into this area. Now, it’s very real.”\n\nNeighborhoods throughout the community of 20,000 people have turned into ghost towns. The tourist destination usually welcomes throngs of visitors leading up to the Labor Day holiday. Instead, souvenir shops and restaurants were closed as the Caldor Fire continued to rage closer each day.\n\n\"Being closer to the state line, it’s all just pure tourism with everyone coming up here for casinos,\" said Breeana Cody, an employee at McP’s Taphouse Grill. \"But everything is pretty vacant right now.”\n\nCody said it's been smoky for days on end. Ash has blanketed the area, too.\n\n“September until the end of the year is pretty good but Labor Day weekend is really our big hurrah,\" Cody said.\n\nWith fewer customers, deciding who should work and when with less revenue coming in has also been a delicate balance for businesses in the area.\n\nOfficials at Barton Memorial Hospital said earlier Monday that all patients were being evacuated and transferred to partner facilities. The hospital can treat up to 63 patients and has a 48-bed skilled nursing facility.\n\nThe fire remained active overnight, especially in the northeast sections of the blaze, and ember casts traveled up to half a mile, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nJeff Marsolais, supervisor for El Dorado National Forest, said fire crews had hoped to prevent the flames from spreading east, but Sunday, \"it let loose.\"\n\n\"Today’s been a rough day, and there’s no bones about it,\" he said.\n\nThe Caldor Fire started Aug. 14 and has burned more than 186,000 acres. It is only 15% contained, according to Cal Fire. Nearly 500 homes have been destroyed and at least five people injured, Cal Fire said.\n\nFire crews have battled in rugged terrain, in some cases carrying hoses from Highway 50 to put out spot fires prompted by the winds. Several homes were destroyed along the highway, as well as minor structures at the Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort.\n\nMore on the Caldor Fire:South Lake Tahoe under evacuation warning as crews struggle to slow blaze\n\nWinds and dry conditions fueled the fire's spread Sunday. “To put it in perspective, we’ve been seeing about a half-mile of movement on the fire’s perimeter each day for the last couple of weeks, and today, this has already moved at 2.5 miles on us, with no sign that it’s starting to slow down,\" Cal Fire Division Chief Eric Schwab said.\n\nAccording to the National Interagency Fire Center, 85 large fires and complexes currently burning have scorched more than 3,900 square miles. California alone has 13 large fires burning.\n\nThe ongoing blazes caused forest officials to close all of the state's national forests to visitors for at least two weeks in hopes of helping fire crews get a handle on spiraling crises.\n\n“We do not take this decision lightly but this is the best choice for public safety,” said Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien. “It is especially hard with the approaching Labor Day weekend, when so many people enjoy our national forests.”\n\nClimate change report:Irreversible changes, warmer temperatures sooner among the alarming findings from the UN climate change report\n\nEast of the Caldor Fire is the Tamarack Fire, which firefighters have largely contained at 82%. The Dixie Fire, farther north and 48% contained, is the second-largest in state history at 1,196 square miles. The Dixie Fire has destroyed 1,277 homes and other buildings, according to Cal Fire.\n\nClimate change has led to particularly active fire seasons across the West in recent years.

Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS/Sipa USA\n\nPutin attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to mark the holiday, and delivered a recorded address for the occasion that touched briefly on the current crisis that has set his country on a clear collision course with the West.\n\n“We see how difficult the developing international situation is, what dangers the current challenges pose, such as weakening of the arms control system or the military activity of the NATO bloc,” Putin said. “At the same time, Russia’s calls to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably protect all countries remain unanswered.”\n\nLittle was new in those remarks, and it’s worth wondering if Russian troops in the tanks and armored vehicles parked just across the border from Ukraine were getting a different message from their commander-in-chief: the precise start time for the launch of a massive military assault against Ukraine. But if a full-scale invasion of Ukraine does happen, it will likely come as a big shock to Russians. Putin has in recent days and weeks failed to lay the public-relations groundwork for a full-scale war.\n\nPutin’s recent comments on Ukraine speak volumes, and they make it clear the Kremlin leader does not see Ukraine as a legitimate state – and that he views an independent Ukraine as an existential threat. Russian state television has rallied around Putin’s arguments, portraying the residents of the breakaway Donbas republics as being under mortal threat from Ukrainian government forces. Putin himself has described the situation there – loosely, and incorrectly, as a genocide.\n\nBut can he expect the kind of surge in patriotic fervor that accompanied Russia’s largely bloodless annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014? That remains to be seen.\n\nIn his angry, hour long speech Monday, Putin recited a litany of historical grievances about Ukraine. But he did not say that ethnic cleansing against Russians was happening in Kyiv, or that Russia should mobilize to defend compatriots in Kharkiv, both Ukrainian cities with sizable numbers of Russian speakers.\n\nThe Kremlin has presented the Donbas recognition with considerable fanfare: Putin deliberated on the matter in a grand, colonnaded hall with his top security deputies on state television, and the following day, the lower and upper houses of Russia’s parliament approved Putin’s request to recognize the Donbas republics, with unanimous votes and standing ovations from lawmakers.\n\nIt was a dismal display of rubber-stamping reminiscent of the Soviet Union’s waning days, when a gerontocratic leadership approved the disastrous invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nThose historical echoes were not lost on opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is currently in a penal colony and is facing a new criminal trial after being sentenced to prison for violating parole terms after being medically evacuated to Germany after a nerve-agent poisoning.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Navalny said the session of Putin’s Security Council reminded him of the “nomenklatura dotards from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union), who, quite similarly, on their own whim, imagining themselves as geopoliticians at the ‘grand chessboard,’ decided to send Soviet troops into Afghanistan.”\n\n2/16 And I thought about the same gathering of nomenklatura dotards from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU, who, quite similarly, on their own whim , imagining themselves as geopoliticians at the “grand chessboard”, decided to send Soviet troops into Afghanistan. — Alexey Navalny (@navalny) February 22, 2022\n\nNavalny, who says the charges against him are politically motivated, added, “Thanks to Putin, hundreds of Ukrainians and Russian citizens may die now, and in the future, this number may reach tens of thousands. Yes, he will not allow Ukraine to develop, he will drag it into the swamp, but Russia will pay the same price.”\n\nWhether Navalny’s prediction will come true is anyone’s guess, but the theater of the past few days could serve as grim prelude if Putin makes the decision to invade Ukraine – and if he does not get a short, victorious war to sell to the Russian public.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}]}

There's actually an influx of travelers hoping to view the red glow of the lava.\n\nThe volcano started to erupt around 11:30 p.m. local time Sunday in Moku‘āweoweo Caldera, located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Early Monday morning the lava started its migration from the summit to the northeast flank. As of Thursday morning, the lava flow was reported to be moving at a \"significantly\" slow pace, with no threat posed to communities or the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the fastest route connecting the Kona and Hilo.\n\n\"It will be spectacular where it is, but the chances of it really interrupting the visitor industry – very, very slim,\" Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said, according to AP.\n\nHowever, some people may have their travel plans impacted. On Monday, Southwest Airlines suspended all operations in Hilo, affecting nine interisland flights between Hilo and Honolulu, a spokesperson for the airline told USA TODAY. Both Southwest Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, the two major carriers to the islands, are offering travel waivers for those with upcoming flights to their respective Hawaii destinations.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nMost activities on Hawaii Island are operating normally, except for a few closures around the volcano.\n\nPeople going to Hawaii Island or who are currently there should monitor the USGS website for updates.\n\nMauna Loa erupts: The largest volcano in the world erupts in Hawaii\n\nCan I still visit Hawaii during the eruption?\n\nYes, visitors can keep their travel plans to the state and even Hawaii Island, officials from Hawaii Tourism Authority said in a statement, since the lava is not yet posing a threat to communities. The other islands are not impacted by the eruption.\n\nHowever, the agency does advise people staying in the communities downslope of the volcano, like Pahala, to \"have emergency preparedness plans ready in the event an evacuation becomes necessary.\" As a safety precaution and in response to people self-evacuating, shelters have opened at the Old Kona Airport in Kailua-Kona and Ka‘u Gymnasium in Pahala.\n\nThose with plans to stay in short-term vacation rentals are advised to contact their hosts for more information.\n\n\"The major resort areas of Kailua-Kona, the Kohala Coast, and Hilo are not immediately downslope of the eruption,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nListen up, tourists:Hawaii locals share what they wish visitors would stop doing\n\nAre flights to Hawaii affected by the eruption?\n\nHawaii Island's two main airports, Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keāhole (KOA) and Hilo International Airport (ITO), remain open as of Monday afternoon in Hawaii. But people with upcoming flights in the state are advised to check with their airline about possible flight disruptions.\n\nSouthwest Airlines canceled all flights in Hilo, which affected nine flights between Hilo and Honolulu on Monday. People flying to and from any of their Hawaii destinations, including Lihue on Kauai and Honolulu, can rebook their flights on Monday and Tuesday without paying any additional fees. Normal operations resumed Tuesday.\n\nHawaiian Airlines posted a travel waiver on Monday morning for people flying to and from Hawaii Island between Monday, Nov. 28 and Dec. 4. Travelers can reschedule their flight at no additional cost as long as they rebook by Dec. 4 or cancel their flight for credit that expires one year from now.\n\n\"Our transpacific and interisland flights, including service to and from Kona and Hilo, are operating as scheduled,\" Kris Tanahara, a spokesperson for Hawaiian Airlines, told USA TODAY. The airline also added an extra flight from Hilo to Honolulu departing Monday evening to \"ensure we can accommodate more travelers whose plans may have changed or been disrupted.\"\n\nAre people on Hawaii Island in immediate danger?\n\nCurrently, there is no immediate danger posed to people in Hawaii. On Monday at 8 a.m., Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth declared a state of emergency but also wrote on Facebook that \"there are no evacuations or threats to the community at this time.\"\n\nThe lava was moving downslope along the northeast flank, which is not populated, as of Monday morning. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted that because the lava has moved into \"less steep terrain,\" there is \"more time for preparation and early warning\" since lava moves faster in steep terrain. The shallow slopes \"allow it to cool more as it moves downhill, slowing its progress even more.\"\n\nThat being said, historically, \"the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,\" according to the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The last time the volcano, one of five in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, erupted was in 1984.\n\nAre there any health hazards from the eruption?\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele's Hair, which are hair strand-like glass fibers formed by gas during a volcanic eruption, could be carried downwind during this time. There is no official threat for ashfall, but people should be mindful that some areas may have \"low-air quality due to vog,\" which is air pollution from volcanic emissions. Short-term health effects include coughing or shortness of breath.\n\nThose with breathing problems, such as asthma, emphysema or COPD, should take precautions such as staying indoors with the doors and windows closed and monitoring the wind when planning to go outside. If you use medications for a respiratory condition, it's advised to speak to your doctor to have them on hand.\n\nIs Hawaii Volcanoes National Park still open during the eruption?\n\nThis is a rare chance for visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to see both Mauna Loa and Kīlauea erupting at the same time. Expect more crowds and longer wait times to witness the sacred event.\n\nThe main areas of the park remain open to the public, according to a press release on Tuesday. The Mauna Loa summit, cabins and high-elevation areas have been closed since early October when the summit first began \"experiencing heightened unrest.\" Mauna Loa Observatory, located just outside the park, is also closed.\n\nStop throwing coins into hot steam vents:Hawaii Volcanoes National Park asks of 'disrespectful' people\n\nThe Mauna Loa Observatory Access Road and Mauna Loa Road up to the gate at Kīpukapuaulu are closed and those who try to access these roads will be subject to fines and arrest, according to a press release by the Department of Land and Natural Resources on Tuesday.\n\n\"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is keeping close watch on Mauna Loa in tandem with our colleagues at USGS and Hawaiʻi County Civil Defense,” Rhonda Loh Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Superintendent, said in a statement. \"The park is currently open, but visitors should be prepared and stay informed.\"\n\nMauna Loa is surrounded by forests and natural reserves, which are now also closed due to the eruption. The nearby Kapāpala Game Management Area, Mauna Loa Forest Reserve, the Kīpuka ʻĀinahou Nēnē Sanctuary, ʻĀinapō Trail and cabin and the Kapāpala Forest Reserve are closed for at least 90 days.\n\nHow can I see the lava flow on Hawaii Island?\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park offers the best views of the lava flow. At night, the lava's glow is \"currently visible from many areas and overlooks surrounding Kaluapele (Kīlauea caldera).\" According to the park's website, here are the best viewing locations and times:\n\nKūpinaʻi Pali (Waldron Ledge) at Kīlauea Visitor Center from 5 to 8 p.m.\n\nKīlauea Overlook\n\nOverlook near Keanakākoʻi Crater from 5 to 9 p.m.\n\nNational Park Service recommended people wear closed-toe shoes and bring a rain jacket in case of inclement weather, and a headlamp for nighttime viewing.\n\nIf you're outside of the park, you can see the lava flow from Daniel K. Inouye Highway – just keep a few things in mind. People are prohibited from stopping or parking on the highway between mile markers 16 and 31. Hawaii Police Department will give citations and tow parked vehicles, according to the County of Hawaii website. People are advised to park in a safer, designated parking lot to see the lava, like the Gil Kahele Recreation Area, which is open 24 hours and offers parking spaces and restrooms.\n\nOtherwise, many residents in both Hilo and Kona said they can see the sky glow red at night from their own homes.\n\nWhen did Mauna Loa last erupt?\n\nVolcanic activity is not unusual for Hawaii, especially Hawaii Island, but eruptions are considered rare, according to Hawaii Tourism Authority.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe volcanic eruption on an island near Tonga in January was as powerful as the 1883 Krakatoa eruption in Indonesia, one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events on record.\n\nScientists have begun to piece together what happened during the January 15 eruption of the undersea Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Tonga’s capital that killed at least three people. The eruption has defied easy explanation and upended scientists’ understanding of this type of volcano.\n\nThe volcanic eruption sent rarely observed pressure waves around the globe for six days and unleashed an unexpected type of tsunami wave, according to two new studies published on Thursday in the journal Science. The huge plume of gases, water vapor and dust also created hurricane-strength winds in space, NASA said in a separate study published this week.\n\nEarly data in the aftermath of the explosion suggested it was the biggest since the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, but the Science studies, which involved 76 scientists in 17 countries, have suggested that the pressure waves it unleashed were similar to those generated by the cataclysmic 1883 Krakatoa eruption and 10 times larger than those from the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption in Skamania County, Washington.\n\n‘Unusually energetic’\n\nThe Tonga eruption was “unusually energetic,” the Science study researchers wrote. The low-frequency atmospheric pressure waves, called Lamb waves, detected after the eruption circled the planet in one direction four times and in the opposite direction three times, they revealed.\n\nA relatively rare phenomenon, these waves travel at the speed of sound. They aren’t detectable by humans and are slower than shock waves, as they have been mistakenly described sometimes, said study author Quentin Brissaud, a geophysicist at the Norwegian Seismic Array in Oslo. Lamb waves were also observed during the Cold War after atmospheric nuclear tests.\n\n“It’s quite rare. So Lamb waves are really related to large air volume displacements. And they mostly propagate along the Earth’s surface,” said coauthor Jelle Assink, senior geophysicist at the seismology and acoustics department at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\nMoving across the surface of multiple oceans and seas, Lamb pressure waves from the explosion created a fast-moving spate of scattered tsunamis.\n\nTraditional tsunamis are usually linked with sudden changes in the ocean floor such as during an earthquake. Crucially, these so-called meteotsunamis travel much faster than traditional tsunamis, arriving two hours earlier than expected, and last longer, which could have implications for early warning systems.\n\nAnd because an atmospheric pressure wave generated them, the tidal waves appeared to “jump continents,” with tsunamis recorded from the Pacific to the Atlantic, said coauthor Silvio De Angelis, professor of volcano geophysics in the department of Earth, ocean and ecological sciences at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe research also revealed that audible sound from the eruption was detected more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) from the source in Alaska – where it was heard as a series of booms. The 1883 Krakatoa eruption was heard 4,800 kilometers (2,980 miles) away, the study said, although it was less systematically reported than the Tonga one.\n\nA lithograph illustrates clouds pouring from the Krakatoa volcano during the cataclysmic 1883 eruption in southwestern Indonesia. Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nThe researchers said more data was needed to understand the mechanism of the eruption.\n\nIt’s thought that one of the reasons for such an energetic explosion – creating an umbrella cloud 30 kilometers high (about 19 miles) and a plume some 58 kilometers high (36 miles) – was because “hot and gas-charged magma entered into contact with the (seawater) very rapidly,” De Angelis said via email. “The rapid transfer of intense heat between hot magma and the cold water causes violent blasts capable of tearing the magma apart.”\n\nSpace disturbance\n\nAnother study, published Tuesday in Geophysical Research Letters, found the Tonga volcano also created havoc in space, spurring hurricane-strength winds, based on data from NASA’s Ionospheric Connection Explorer, or ICON, mission and the European Space Agency’s Swarm satellites.\n\nThe giant plume of gases, water vapor and dust pushed into the sky by the eruption created large pressure disturbances in the atmosphere, leading to strong winds, NASA said in a statement. As these winds expanded upward into thinner layers of the atmosphere, they began moving faster.\n\n“Upon reaching the ionosphere and the edge of space, ICON clocked the windspeeds at up to 450 mph – making them the strongest winds below 120 miles altitude measured by the mission since its launch,” NASA said.\n\n(From left) Satellite images from January 6 and January 18 show the volcanic eruption's impact near Tonga. Maxar Technologies/AP\n\nIn the ionosphere, where the Earth’s atmosphere meets space, the extreme winds also buffeted electric currents, flipping particles from their usual east-flowing electric current – called the equatorial electrojet – to a westward direction for a short period, and the electrojet surged to five times its normal peak power.\n\n“It’s very surprising to see the electrojet be greatly reversed by something that happened on Earth’s surface,” said Joanne Wu, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the new Geophysical Research Letters study.\n\n“This is something we’ve only previously seen with strong geomagnetic storms, which are a form of weather in space caused by particles and radiation from the sun.”\n\nBrian Harding, a physicist at UC Berkeley and lead author, said the Tonga eruption was “allowing us to test the poorly understood connection between the lower atmosphere and space.”\n\nHe added, “The volcano created one of the largest disturbances in space we’ve seen in the modern era.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/weather/hawaii-mauna-loa-volcano-eruption/index.html", "title": "Hawaii's Mauna Loa is erupting for the first time since 1984 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe world’s largest active volcano, Mauna Loa on Hawaii, is erupting for the first time in nearly 40 years.\n\nThough lava is flowing down one side of the volcano, the eruption in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is not threatening communities, the US Geological Survey said midday Monday.\n\n“All indications are that the eruption will remain in the Northeast Rift Zone,” the agency said in an advisory, referring to an area where a volcano is splitting, allowing for lava flow. “Volcanic gas and possibly fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of lava glass) may be carried downwind.”\n\nA “trace to less than one quarter inch” of ashfall could accumulate on parts of the island, the National Weather Service in Honolulu said.\n\n“Passengers with flights to Hilo International Airport (ITO) or the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA) should check with their airline prior to heading to the airport due to the volcanic activity at Mauna Loa,” according to an advisory by the state Transportation Department.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is not operating from Hilo International Monday because of the eruption, the airline announced.

Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/world/sri-lanka-former-president-entry-thailand-intl/index.html", "title": "Former Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa requests to travel to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThailand has received a request from former Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to enter the country, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Tanee Sangrat said in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\nRajapaksa is currently in Singapore after fleeing Sri Lanka in July amid mass anti-government protests.

As residents and tourists rush to witness and honor the rare dual eruptions, officials have enlisted the help of the National Guard.\n\n“Gov. David Ige and Maj. General Kenneth Hara activated 20 Hawai’i National Guard service members on Monday and placed them on active duty to assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said Monday.\n\nOfficials also created a safe viewing spot on a one-way route accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said.\n\nThe lava flow’s pace isn’t steady, so it’s challenging to predict exactly when lava might hit the major highway, also known as Saddle Road.\n\n“There are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advances are expected to change over periods of hours to days, making it difficult to estimate when or if the flow will impact Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThe last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984, when its lava reached about 4.5 miles from Hilo, the largest population center on the Big Island.\n\nIf or when lava from the current eruption reaches the critical highway largely depends on how long Mauna Loa erupts, a volcano expert said.\n\n“We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the US Geological Survey at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nMauna Loa and Kilauea are in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which remains open as it urges spectators to view the dual eruptions safely.\n\n“Stepping into week two of the Mauna Loa eruption,” the park posted Monday on Facebook. “Two volcanoes, two eruptions, one park. It was another ‘glowrious’ morning today!”\n\nLava fountains and flows illuminate the sky Monday near Mauna Loa. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nHonoring the volcanoes’ spiritual power\n\nWhile some see the Big Island’s eruptions as a threat, for many Native Hawaiians, the eruptions have incredible spiritual significance.\n\nKu’ulei Vickery, a Native Hawaiian and a teacher at a nearby public school, was among those who witnessed the glowing orange molten rock flow Friday. She performed a traditional Hawaiian chant and left rosemary grown in her backyard as an offering.\n\n“As a native, I’m acknowledging the space that I am in. I’m acknowledging the goddess Pele, and the people who have come before me, my ancestors,” she said. “You don’t go to anyone’s house empty-handed. So this is what I brought.”\n\nOfficials urged anyone who wants to watch the dual eruptions to be aware of the possible health hazards in the air.\n\nVolcanic emissions include sulfur dioxide, which reacts with other elements in the atmosphere and can begin to form fine particles which cause vog, a type of volcanic air pollution known as volcanic smog.\n\n“Vog creates the potential for airborne health hazards to residents and visitors, damages agricultural crops and other plants, and affects livestock operations,” the USGS said.\n\nLava shoots up Monday from a fissure of the Mauna Loa volcano.

Satellite imagery showed a massive ash cloud and shockwaves spreading from the eruption. Ash was falling from the sky in the Tonga capital, Nuku’alofa, Saturday evening and phone connections were down.\n\nThe eruption caused a severe tsunami on Tongatapu, where the capital is located, with waves flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nSo far, New Zealand authorities have not received any reports of deaths or injuries in Tonga related to the eruption, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nThe tsunami had a “significant impact” on Nuku’alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore, and shops along the coast damaged, she added.\n\nRNZ reported that residents fled for higher ground as waves swept the waterfront, main street and grounds of Tonga’s Royal Palace. Though it was early evening, videos show the sky already dark from the ash cloud.\n\nTonga’s King Tupou VI was evacuated from the palace, RNZ said, citing local media reports of a convoy of police and troops rushing the monarch to a villa at Mata Ki Eua.\n\nTelecommunications were affected, though it’s not clear how widespread the damage is yet, Ardern said, adding that the main undersea cable has been impacted likely due to loss of power.\n\nThe New Zealand government has committed an initial $340,000 in relief supplies, technical support, and supporting local responses, with the country’s Defence Force sending assistance to Tonga, Ardern said.\n\nShe added that while conditions in the area seem stable, further eruption activity cannot be ruled out.\n\nImpact in Japan\n\nThe eruption also had effects across the Pacific, as tsunami warnings and advisories were issued from parts of New Zealand and Japan to the United States and Canada’s British Columbia.\n\nPer the National Weather Service, a tsunami warning means those nearby should get inland or seek higher ground immediately, while an advisory means they should stay away from the shore and out of the water.\n\nJapan’s Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory for the country’s coastal areas early Sunday morning, with the northeastern prefecture of Iwate seeing waves as high as 2.7 meters (9 feet). Multiple smaller tsunamis were reported in numerous other locations, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted, the meteorological agency said. Weather agency officials ruled out the possibility of further tsunamis across the country, but said there might be some tidal fluctuations.\n\nJapan’s coast guard was out assessing damage, but so far none had been reported, NHK said, noting it was still dark and more waves were expected. Officials continued to ask people to stay alert and away from beaches.\n\nFootage shared on NHK from a viewer in Setouchi town, on Amami Oshima Island, showed bumper-to-bumper traffic as cars evacuated to higher ground. Other footage showed people sleeping on floors in evacuation centers in Iwate.\n\nA tsunami has hit Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu. @sakakimoana/Twitter\n\nElsewhere, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said it recorded a tsunami wave of 1.2 meters (about 4 feet) near Nuku’alofa at 5:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said tsunami waves of 2.7 feet (0.8 meters) were observed by gauges at Nuku’alofa and waves of 2 feet at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, Reuters reported.\n\nThe nearby island of Fiji also issued a public advisory asking people living in low-lying coastal areas to “move to safety in anticipation of the strong currents and dangerous waves.” Footage from the ground shows people fleeing to higher ground in Suva, the capital of Fiji, as large waves hit the coast.\n\nIn Samoa, another Pacific island nation, a tsunami watch is in effect for all low-lying coastal areas, the Samoa Meteorological Service said, with residents and visitors advised to stay away from beach areas.\n\nAn earlier tsunami advisory for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu was discontinued, with the country’s National Disaster Management issuing an “all clear.” The office had earlier advised residents to move away from the coastline and seek higher ground.\n\nWaves seen in the US\n\nThe eruption also sent waves to the US West Coast, with some exceeding 3 and 4 feet in height, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego.\n\nThe highest waves recorded were in Port San Luis, California (4.3 feet); King Cove, Alaska (3.3 feet); Area Cove, California (3.7 feet); Crescent City, California (3.7 feet); and Port Reyes, California (2.9 feet).\n\nThe first tsunami waves were felt on the West Coast early Saturday morning, according to Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator at the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.\n\nA wave as high as 1.2 feet had been observed in Nikolski, Alaska, he told CNN via telephone, while waves as tall as 1 foot were observed in Atka, Adak and King Cove, Alaska.\n\n“This may not be the largest wave as this is coming in yet,” Snider told CNN, saying the event was not over.\n\nAsh rises into the air after a powerful underwater volcanic eruption in the South Pacific.

All of the advisories had been lifted by early Sunday morning, according the Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning tweeted no damage was reported thus far from the tsunami observed in the Hawaiian Islands. A tsunami advisory for Hawaii was canceled by the agency Saturday morning.\n\nAdam Weintraub, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, told CNN there were “no reports of major damage so far,” though the effects had been felt across multiple islands. Officials were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe impacts were the equivalent of a “high King Tide,” Weintraub said earlier, telling CNN there had been flooding in parking lots and harbor areas he characterized as “nuisance flooding.”\n\nSpeaking by telephone, Snider said, “We don’t have a really good forecast because this event is based on a volcano rather than an earthquake.”\n\nNonetheless, the National Weather Service in Seattle urged caution along the US Pacific Coast on Saturday. “Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas in these areas,” NWS Seattle tweeted.\n\nThe city of Laguna Beach, California, closed all beaches, boardwalks, harbors and piers until further notice in response to the tsunami advisory early Saturday morning, telling residents, “please stay out of the water and away from the shore.”\n\nSanta Cruz, California, also experienced some “minor flooding” at the harbor, city manager Elizabeth Smith told CNN.\n\nHigh tide comes into a harbor in Santa Cruz, California, seen in this still image from a video obtained by CNN. The water quickly drained out, Brad Anderson -- the person that provided the video -- said. Brad Anderson\n\nThe waves came right at high tide, Fire Chief Rob Young said. The initial wave occurred at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time, he said, bringing with it a 1 to 2-foot wave right at the peak of high tide. The largest wave came in at about 8:49 a.m. local time, prompting a surge of about 7 feet at the harbor. A subsequent surge just after 10 a.m. was “diminished.”\n\n“When it comes, it comes quickly,” he said. “Not just a 1-foot wave, but it comes in a surge because it draws all the water out first, and then it comes in.”\n\nThere was some damage in the harbor and to some docks, he said. There was also “light flooding” on the beaches and up to the city’s first surface street, Young said.\n\nAll beaches and the harbor will be closed until at least noon local time, Smith said, and people were evacuated from nearby stores and the area near the harbor, though no one has been evacuated from their homes. A surf contest has been postponed and is expected to resume later Saturday.\n\nNew Zealand on alert\n\nA tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas on the north and east coast of New Zealand’s North Island and the Chatham Islands, where “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore” were expected, according to New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNew Zealand’s official weather service said its weather stations across the country had observed “a pressure surge” on Saturday evening from the eruption.\n\nA satellite image taken by Himawari-8, a Japanese weather satellite, and released by the agency, shows an undersea volcano eruption at the Pacific nation of Tonga Saturday, January 15, 2022. Japan Meteorology Agency/AP\n\nScientist Emily Lane, of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre it was a “very significant” eruption.\n\n“The shock wave from it is clearly visible in satellite imagery and there are reports of the eruption being heard at least as far away as New Zealand,” she said. “The tsunami from the eruption has reached over 2,500 kilometers being recorded on gauges over all of Aotearoa.”\n\nTsunamis generated by volcanoes are much less common than tsunamis from underwater earthquakes, Lane said.\n\nA smaller eruption in late 2014 and early 2015 built up the crater of the volcano to above the surface of the water, Lane added, but it’s not yet clear exactly how Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai erupted on this occasion. “When we see what is left of the island after this eruption is over we can start to put together the pieces of what happened,” she said.\n\n1.14.2022: (correction on date) Large volcanic eruption near Tonga (Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano) today as seen from outer space.

People of Tonga must also remain vigilant for further eruptions and especially tsunami with short notice and should avoid low-lying areas.”\n\nAn earlier tsunami warning issued for American Samoa has since been canceled, according to the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThere is no tsunami threat to Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from a “distant eruption,” according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe volcano had been active from December 20, but was declared dormant on January 11, according to RNZ.", "authors": ["Alex Stambaugh Laura Smith-Spark Rhea Mogul Sophie Jeong Dakin Andone", "Alex Stambaugh", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Rhea Mogul", "Sophie Jeong", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/asia/kazakhstan-fuel-protests-emergency-wednesday-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia-led military alliance CSTO will send 'peacekeepers' to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“Peacekeepers” from a Russia-led military alliance of post-Soviet states will be sent to Kazakhstan to help stabilize the country following deadly protests against a hike in fuel prices, Armenia’s Prime Minister said Wednesday.\n\nThe Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – which includes Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan – decided to send collective “peacekeeping forces” for a “limited” period of time “in view of the threat to national security and the sovereignty of the Republic of Kazakhstan,” according to a statement from Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who is also chairman of the alliance.\n\nThe move follows an appeal from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for help from the alliance after unrest broke out across Kazakhstan on Wednesday, including in the largest city, Almaty.\n\nEight police officers and national guard personnel were killed in riots in different regions of the country, according to Kazakhstan’s local outlet Tengrinews.kz.

It flew about 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles) for 20 minutes at an estimated maximum altitude of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) over Japan’s Tohoku region on the main island of Honshu before falling into the Pacific Ocean, some 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from the country’s shore, Japanese officials said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida strongly condemned the launch and called North Korea’s recent ballistic missile launches “outrageous” in comments to reporters at his official residence.\n\nTuesday’s launch is the country’s 23rd such missile test this year, including both ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nThere were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels near the missile trajectory, according to Japanese authorities, but the unannounced missile triggered a rare J-alert, a system designed to inform the public of emergencies and threats in Japan.\n\nIn such emergencies, alerts are sent out via sirens, through community radio stations and to individual smartphone users. On Tuesday, alerts were sent out at around 7:30 a.m. local time to people in Aomori prefecture, Hokkaido and Tokyo’s Izu and Ogasawara islands, according to Japanese officials.\n\nA tweet posted by Japan’s Prime Minister’s office urged residents to take shelter in buildings and to “not approach anything suspicious that is found and to immediately contact the police or fire department.”\n\nSouth Korea, US condemn missile launch\n\nOther governments were quick to decry the launch, with South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol branding it a “reckless” provocation, adding that North Korea will face a decisive response from the South Korean military and its allies.\n\nThe White House also “strongly condemned” the test, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson calling it a “destabilizing” action that shows North Korea’s “blatant disregard for United Nations Security Council resolutions and international safety norms.”\n\nThe allies conducted a precision bombing exercise in response, which involved a South Korean F-15K fighter jet firing two air-to-surface munitions at a virtual target in a firing range west of the Korean Peninsula, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. South Korea and the United States conducted a similar exercise in March in reaction to another ballistic missile launch by North Korea.\n\nKim Seung-kyum, chief of the JCS, and Paul LaCamera, the United States Forces Korea commander, held a meeting after the launch and reaffirmed the combined defense posture will be further strengthened against any threats and provocations from North Korea, the JCS said.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command also released a statement saying American commitments to the defense of Japan and South Korea “remain ironclad.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with both his Japanese and South Korean counterparts after the launch.\n\nAnkit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regular missile testing was was part of North Korea’s plan to maintain its nuclear forces.\n\n“It is quite possible that the United States, South Korea and Japan will take away a message from this missile test that North Korea is continuing to assert itself to show that it has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to targets including the US territory of Guam,” he said, adding that “risk reduction” to stop a crisis from escalating should be the current priority.\n\n“If such a crisis were to play out, it would play out under a significantly more advanced North Korean nuclear capability, which I think would significantly limit the options that the United States and South Korea would have, potentially to retaliate or manage escalation with North Korea,” he said.\n\nNorth Korea’s potential nuclear plans\n\nTuesday’s launch could herald an intensification of provocations by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, experts told CNN.\n\n“Pyongyang is still in the middle of a provocation and testing cycle and is likely waiting until after China’s mid-October Communist Party Congress to conduct an even more significant test,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n“The Kim regime is developing weapons such as tactical nuclear warheads and submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of a long-term strategy to outrun South Korea in an arms race and drive wedges among US allies.”\n\nFour previous missile launches occurred in the space of a week in late September and early October, around the same time US Vice President Kamala Harris made an official visit to Japan and South Korea, and as US, Japanese and South Korean navies held joint exercises.\n\nNorth Korea’s tests also come as international attention remains firmly focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and as both Moscow and Beijing appear reluctant to side with the West to further censure Pyongyang.\n\nIn May, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution to strengthen sanctions on North Korea for its weapons testing, in a vote the US said was likely to fuel Pyongyang’s program to develop nuclear-capable missile systems.\n\nWashington and the International Atomic Energy Agency have both warned this year that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, which would be its first since 2017.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, drew a connection between the missile tests and a potential nuclear test.\n\n“North Korea is going to keep conducting missile tests until the current round of modernization is done. I don’t think a nuclear (test) explosion is far behind,” he told CNN.", "authors": ["Yoonjung Seo Emiko Jozuka Junko Ogura Brad Lendon Simone Mccarthy", "Yoonjung Seo", "Emiko Jozuka", "Junko Ogura", "Brad Lendon", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/asia/north-korea-missiles-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea fired the highest number of short-range missiles in a ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe South Korean military said Wednesday North Korea launched the highest number of short-range missiles in a day as Seoul retaliated to Pyongyang’s latest barrage of weapons tests, further escalating tensions in the region.\n\nNorth Korea fired as many as 23 missiles of different types to the east and west of the Korean Peninsula, including a surface-to-air missile into the waters off the east and west coasts of the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\nOne of the missiles launched by Pyongyang was a short-range ballistic missile that landed close to South Korean territorial waters for the first time since the division of Korea, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.\n\nJCS said the missile landed in international waters 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of South Korea’s Ulleung island, about 26 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border that North Korea does not recognize.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told journalists North Korea is firing missiles at an \"unprecedently high frequency\" in the wake of escalating tensions in the region. Kyodo/Reuters\n\nJapan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea conducted another launch later on Wednesday, including at least one more ballistic missile toward the east that has fallen into the sea outside of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\nThe ballistic missile flew a short distance at a maximum altitude of less than 50 km, Toshiro Ino, the deputy minister of defense, told reporters on Wednesday evening local time.\n\n“North Korea has rapidly escalated its provocations, launching more than a dozen missiles today alone and reportedly firing more than 100 artillery shells into the Japan sea since announcing an extremely provocative statement earlier in the day” Ino said.\n\nNo damage to aircraft or vessels has been confirmed as of now.\n\nWhen asked whether North Korea had in the past launched this many missiles throughout a day, Ino told reporters that in 2006 and 2009 the North had fired several missiles throughout the day from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time, and 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time, respectively, without mentioning an exact number of missiles.\n\nA South Korean defense official said earlier the missiles landed to the west of the peninsula in the Yellow Sea, known as the West Sea in Korea, and to the east in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.\n\nAn air raid warning on Ulleung island, located about 120 kilometers east of the peninsula, was lifted about 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North Korean test was an “effective territorial encroachment.”\n\nAt an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting, Yoon “ordered that a stern response be swiftly taken so that North Korea’s provocation pays a clear price,” according to South Korea’s presidential office.\n\nIn an immediate response, South Korea launched three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets on Wednesday morning, according to JCS.\n\nJCS said the South Korean Air Force targeted international waters north of the NLL at an equal distance to that which the North Korean missile had earlier landed south of the line.\n\n“Our military’s precise strike showed our will to firmly respond to any North Korean provocations including short-range ballistic missile, and our capability and readiness to precisely target the enemy,” JCS said.\n\nNorth Korea is “fully responsible” for the situation as they are the ones continuing to provoke despite warnings, JCS added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that North Korea is launching missiles at an “unprecedentedly high frequency.”\n\nKishida also called for a National Security Council meeting to be held as soon as possible due to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“North Korea’s unprecedented launch of multiple ballistic missiles is recklessly threatening the security of the Republic of Korea,” Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Penny Wong, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n“Pyongyang must cease this action,” she added.\n\nSouth Korea responded to North Korea's barrage of missiles on Wednesday by firing three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets. South Korea's Defence Ministry/Yonhap/Reuters\n\nMoscow urged North and South Korea to avoid steps that “could provoke a further increase in tension,” as it contends with fractured global relations amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The situation is already very tense on the peninsula, and we urge everyone to remain calm and avoid steps that could provoke a further increase,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned North Korea’s unprecedented missile launch overnight.\n\nThomas-Greenfield told CNN on This Morning with Don Lemon, Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow that the launch breaks “multiple Security Council resolutions” and said the UN would be “putting pressure” on China and Russia to improve and enhance such sanctions.\n\nShe declined to say whether US President Joe Biden would raise it with China’s President Xi at the G20, but added it was “on the President’s mind.”\n\nPeople watch a television screen showing a news broadcast with file footage of a North Korean missile test, at a railway station in Seoul on November 2, 2022.

It also means that the failure to administer the warning will not expose a law enforcement officer to potential damages in a civil lawsuit. It will not impact, however, the exclusion of such evidence at a criminal trial.\n\nThe court clarified that while the Miranda warning protects a constitutional right, the warning itself is not a right that would trigger the ability to bring a civil lawsuit.\n\n“Today’s ruling doesn’t get rid of the Miranda right,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “But it does make it far harder to enforce. Under this ruling, the only remedy for a violation of Miranda is to suppress statements obtained from a suspect who’s not properly advised of his right to remain silent. But if the case never goes to trial, or if the government never seeks to use the statement, or if the statement is admitted notwithstanding the Miranda violation, there’s no remedy at all for the government’s misconduct.”\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, joined by the five other Republican-appointed justices, said that a violation of the Miranda right “is not itself a violation of the Fifth Amendment,” and that “we see no justification for expanding Miranda to confer a right to sue,” under the relevant statute.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, joined by the other liberal justices, said that the court’s ruling was stripping “individuals of the ability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized in Miranda.”\n\n“The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy,” she added.\n\nThe case involved Terence Tekoh, a hospital worker who was accused of sexually assaulting an immobilized female patient at a local hospital in 2014.\n\nAt issue was not whether a defendant must be read his Miranda rights, but whether he can sue an officer for damages if he doesn’t receive the Miranda warning for evidence introduced in a criminal proceeding. Lower courts have split on the issue.\n\nCarlos Vega, a Los Angeles County sheriff deputy, questioned Tekoh, although he failed to read him his rights as required by the 1966 precedent of Miranda v. Arizona, where the court held that a defendant must be warned of a “right to remain silent.” Under that precedent, without the Miranda warning, criminal trial courts are generally barred from admitting self-incriminating statements made while the defendant was in custody.\n\nTekoh ultimately confessed to the crime, was tried and acquitted – even after the introduction of his confession at trial. Later, he sued the officer under a federal law, Section 1983, that allows suits for damages against a government official for violating constitutional rights.\n\nThe parties disagreed on whether Vega used coercive techniques to extract an involuntary confession.\n\nLawyers for Vega said Tekoh’s statement was entirely consensual and voluntary, and he was not technically “in custody” at the time, while Tekoh’s lawyers contended he was bullied into confessing in a windowless room.\n\nRoman Martinez, a lawyer for Vega, said that Tekoh couldn’t bring his claim because establishing a violation of Miranda does not establish a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n“Miranda creates a procedural rule barring prosecutors from introducing—and courts from admitting—certain unwarned statements as a part of the prosecution’s case-in-chief at a criminal trial,” Martinez argued in court papers.\n\nFor Martinez, the Miranda warning is a constitutional rule, it is not a right, and under that interpretation the lawsuit cannot go forward. “Miranda does not prohibit taking unwarned statements; it merely forbids the subsequent admission of such statements at trial,” Martinez argued.\n\nHe said an appeals court ruling that went in favor of Tekoh would “saddle police departments nationwide with extraordinary burdens in connection with lawful and appropriate investigative work.” Any police interaction, according to Martinez, could give rise to a private lawsuit “even where the police officer has acted entirely lawfully.”\n\nMartinez commended the court’s ruling Thursday, saying it “confirms that Deputy Vega cannot be sued for his good-faith effort to investigate the alleged sexual assault of a defenseless hospital patient.”\n\n“As the Court explained, the landmark Miranda decision establishes an important prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination,” he added. “But the failure to give a Miranda warning does not automatically equate to a violation of the Fifth Amendment.”\n\nThe Biden administration sided with Vega.\n\n“Because the Miranda rule concerns the introduction of evidence at trial, a suspect may not sue the police officer under Section 1983 for violating that rule,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in court papers.\n\nLawyers for Tekoh argued that Vega refused to accept Tekoh’s denials and that “with a hand resting on his firearm,” Vega threatened to report Tekoh and his family members to immigration. Tekoh has a green card, and deportation could lead to persecution in Cameroon.\n\nPaul Hoffman, a lawyer for Tekoh, said that Vega was “the central actor in the chain of events leading directly to the statement being introduced at trial.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/13/supreme-court-code-of-conduct-clarence-thomas/71569902007/", "title": "Supreme Court adopts code of conduct after Clarence Thomas ...", "text": "The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will honor a code of conduct for the first time in its 234-year history − a response to a litany of recent controversies involving private jet travel and posh vacations accepted by some justices that polls suggest has undermined public faith in the nation's highest court.\n\n\"For the most part these rules and principles are not new,\" the court said in a statement. \"The absence of a code, however, has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the justices of this court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\"\n\nThe code, which the court said was agreed to by all nine members of the court, encourages justices to recuse from a pending case if they have \"a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\"\n\nIt also says justices should not speak at events sponsored by or associated with a political party or a group that \"has a substantial financial interest in the outcome of a case\" before the court. A justice, the code reads, can accept \"reasonable compensation and reimbursement\" for travel \"if the source of the payments does not give the appearance of influencing the justice’s official duties or otherwise appear improper.\"\n\nIllinois Sen. Richard Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the announcement a \"step in the right direction\" on the Senate floor. A frequent critic of the court, Durbin framed the code as a symbolic victory, even as he raised concerns about how much teeth the document will have.\n\n\"For the first time in history, the Supreme Court of the United States is at least saying to the American people, 'we hear you,'\" Durbin said.\n\nSupreme Court critics: Where's the enforcement?\n\nBut the code itself included no enforcement mechanism, an omission the court's critics immediately jumped on. Outside experts have said enforcing a code of conduct on the Supreme Court would be especially tricky, given that no other tribunal exists that could overrule a decision made by a justice or the court itself.\n\nOthers criticized the court's statement for describing the ethics scandals that have swirled around the court as a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, that reaction, and this code, leave much to be desired,\" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a group that has long advocated for tighter ethics standards at the Supreme Court. \"That it's largely a copy-and-paste job from the lower court's code fails to account for so much.\"\n\nTo say the code of conduct \"fails to meet the moment would be an understatement,\" said Caroline Ciccone, president of a group called Accountable.US, which has been a sharp critic of the court and Thomas. \"After a year of countless ethics issues and mounting pressure to fix its corruption crisis, the court released a set of written − and apparently unenforceable − guidelines.\"\n\nIn a statement attached to the code, the court said that Chief Justice John Roberts had directed court officials to review how state and lower federal courts have helped jurists comply with similar requirements. Roberts noted that some lower courts rely on software to help judges flag potential conflicts of interest in pending cases.\n\nIn other words, it's possible the Supreme Court could take other steps.\n\nThe announcement was an acknowledgment that many Americans were \"ranting and raving\" about the fact that the court had done little to address the criticism over ethics, said Timothy Johnson, a professor of political science and law at the University of Minnesota. On the other hand, he said, the line about looking to other courts was an acknowledgment that \"they haven't fully figured it out yet.\"\n\n\"It's pretty hard to write rules when people are in the middle of breaking whatever rules you might be creating,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"To me, the real question is how the public is supposed to have confidence that the justices are complying with whatever rules they’ve chosen to adopt,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"Even the most rigorous ethics rules of which one might conceive are meaningless if there’s no means of monitoring whether they’re being followed.\"\n\nSupreme Court ethics rules follow months of revelations about Thomas\n\nThe announcement arrived at a moment when the Supreme Court has been heavily criticized after a series of stories this year detailing lavish travel that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from GOP donor Harlan Crow, as well as revelations that Justice Samuel Alito flew to Alaska for a fishing trip on a private jet in 2008 that belonged to a hedge fund manager who repeatedly brought cases before the high court.\n\nThose revelations spurred Democrats in Congress to pursue legislation that would require the Supreme Court to adopt a code of ethics, similar to what lower federal courts follow. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have threatened to subpoena Crow and Leonard Leo, a well-connected conservative legal advocate who has appeared on many of the trips at issue, though that effort was abruptly stalled last week.\n\nIt is not only conservative justices who have been the subject of ethics revelations: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, drew attention this year after a story by the Associated Press documented that some of her aides pressed colleges and a library to order copies of books she had written in connection with public speaking events.\n\nBut Thomas, the most senior associate justice, has been at the center of the bulk of the stories, many of which appeared in ProPublica earlier this year. They include revelations that Crow purchased three Georgia properties from Thomas and members of his family in 2014, a transaction the justice failed to note on his annual disclosure forms.\n\nAnother story documented that Crow had paid private boarding school tuition for a member of Thomas' family. Yet another, published in the New York Times, showed that Thomas purchased an RV with a personal loan from a wealthy health care executive. The terms of that loan have not been disclosed but congressional Democrats say that it appears much of the principle was never repaid before it was ultimately closed.\n\nThomas has repeatedly pushed back on the stories and denied wrongdoing. In a statement released in August, an attorney representing Thomas defended the justice's past reporting and dismissed criticism of the gifts as partisan attacks.\n\nThe attorney, Elliot Berke, blasted Thomas' critics as \"left-wing organizations with largely undisclosed supporters that stand diametrically opposed to his judicial philosophy.\" Berke said that while public figures \"may be the targets of weaponized ethics allegations,… all Americans\" ultimately suffer from the criticism.\n\nWhile Roberts has steadfastly defended the Supreme Court's independence, the chorus of calls for some sort of response to the scandals has shown little sign of quieting this year. Three justices − Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett− in recent weeks all appeared to publicly endorse some form of a conduct code.\n\nAs the criticism has continued, public polling has indicated that trust in the high court remains at record lows. Less than half of Americans said they have confidence in the Supreme Court, according to a Gallup survey in late September. Those polls have tended to show a far higher disapproval of the court among Democrats than Republicans.\n\nThe ethics debate has cast a shadow over the term, which began in October and runs through June. The court has been steadily building a docket that includes some blockbuster controversies, including a case about whether the government can block domestic abusers from owning guns, whether the abortion pill mifepristone will remain widely available and whether courts will have more power to curb federal agencies.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-leak-phone-records/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court Roe v. Wade leak investigation heats up as clerks ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSupreme Court officials are escalating their search for the source of the leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, taking steps to require law clerks to provide cell phone records and sign affidavits, three sources with knowledge of the efforts have told CNN.\n\nSome clerks are apparently so alarmed over the moves, particularly the sudden requests for private cell data, that they have begun exploring whether to hire outside counsel.\n\nThe court’s moves are unprecedented and the most striking development to date in the investigation into who might have provided Politico with the draft opinion it published on May 2. The probe has intensified the already high tensions at the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority is poised to roll back a half-century of abortion rights and privacy protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts met with law clerks as a group after the breach, CNN has learned, but it is not known whether any systematic individual interviews have occurred.\n\nLawyers outside the court who have become aware of the new inquiries related to cell phone details warn of potential intrusiveness on clerks’ personal activities, irrespective of any disclosure to the news media, and say they may feel the need to obtain independent counsel.\n\n“That’s what similarly situated individuals would do in virtually any other government investigation,” said one appellate lawyer with experience in investigations and knowledge of the new demands on law clerks. “It would be hypocritical for the Supreme Court to prevent its own employees from taking advantage of that fundamental legal protection.”\n\nSources familiar with efforts underway say the exact language of the affidavits or the intended scope of that cell phone search – content or time period covered – is not yet clear.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not respond to a CNN request on Monday for comment related to the phone searches and affidavits.\n\nThe young lawyers selected to be law clerks each year are regarded as the elite of the elite. (Each justice typically hires four.) They are overwhelmingly graduates of Ivy League law schools and have had prior clerkships with prominent US appellate court judges.\n\nTheir one-year service becomes a golden ticket to prestigious law firms, top government jobs or professorships. Six of the current nine Supreme Court justices are former clerks.\n\nThe escalating scrutiny of law clerks reflects Roberts’ concerns about the breach in confidentiality and possibly further leaks. It also suggests the court has been so far unsuccessful in determining Politico’s source.\n\nRoberts ordered the investigation on May 3, designating the court’s marshal, Gail Curley, to lead the probe.\n\nCurley, a lawyer and former Army colonel, oversees the police officers at the building. She is best known to the public as the person who chants, “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” at the beginning of the justices’ oral argument sessions. The marshal’s office would not normally examine the details of cell phone data or engage in a broad-scale investigation of personnel.\n\nThe investigation comes at the busiest time in the court’s annual term, when relations among the justices are already taut. Assisted by their law clerks, the justices are pressing toward late June deadlines, trying to resolve differences in the toughest cases, all with new pressures and public scrutiny.\n\nBecause of protests and security concerns related to the Mississippi abortion case, the court building is surrounded by an 8-foot non-scalable fence and concrete barriers.\n\nThe justices are also resolving a New York dispute that could, based on their remarks during oral arguments in November, expand Second Amendment protection for gun owners. Additionally, the court could further lower the wall of separation between church and state by permitting certain prayer at public schools and requiring public vouchers for religious institutions.\n\nThe draft opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was written by Justice Samuel Alito and appeared to have a five-justice majority to completely reverse the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. That landmark ruling made abortion legal nationwide and buttressed other privacy interests not expressly stated in the Constitution. Some law professors have warned that if Roe is reversed, the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage could be in jeopardy.\n\nPublication of the Alito draft opinion has already prompted national protests and dueling state legislative efforts – to further eliminate all options for a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy or, alternatively, to try to safeguard women’s access to abortion where possible.\n\nBut it is difficult for anyone outside the building to know whether the Alito draft still commands a majority on a court tightly divided on abortion rights and split over how quickly to reverse precedent.\n\nScrutiny of a secretive group\n\nAs the justices continue their secret negotiations, the scrutiny of the law clerks is heating up.\n\nThe clerks have been the subject of much of the outside speculation over who might have disclosed the draft, but they are not the only insiders who had access. Alito’s opinion, labeled a first draft and dated February 10, would have been circulated to the nine justices, their clerks, and key staffers within each justice’s chambers and select administrative offices.\n\nIf tradition was followed, copies were sent electronically and, separately, printed out and hand-delivered to chambers by aides to the marshal.\n\nOther employees connected to the nine chambers would have had some access to the opinion. CNN could not verify that number, but former law clerks say the document could have been sent through regular channels to nearly 75 people. It is not known if court officials are asking employees who are part of the permanent staff, beyond the one-year law clerks, for their phone records.\n\nCell phones, of course, hold an enormous amount of information, related to personal interactions, involving all manner of content, texts and images, as well as apps used. It is uncertain whether details linked only to calls would be sought or whether a broader retrieval would occur.\n\nThere are protocols for handling drafts of court opinions, which circulate electronically on a closed system, separate from the computer system the justices and court employees use to communicate with people outside the court. Yet it is possible for printed copies to leave the building under even innocent circumstances, as work is taken home.\n\nCourt officials are secretive even in normal times.

The agency made the results of these tests publicly available on its website.\n\nClaim: Animals in the area are dying\n\nSee this claim on social media (direct link, archive link)\n\nThousands of fish are believed to have died from chemicals spilled due to the train derailment. Officials have not documented widespread deaths among nonaquatic wildlife, though there are anecdotal reports of that from local residents.\n\nAbout 3,500 fish across 12 species have died in creeks and streams near East Palestine in the aftermath of the incident, Mary Mertz, director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, said at a Feb. 14 news conference.\n\nThere doesn't appear to have been any increase in the number of fish and other aquatic animals killed since the first few days after the derailment, Mertz said.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of nonaquatic species suffering from the derailment,\" she added.\n\nThere have been anecdotal reports of other animals becoming sick or dying in the wake of the derailment. Teresa McGuire, director of the Columbiana County Humane Society, which covers East Palestine, told the Herald-Star she has been compiling a list of animals possibly sickened from exposure to toxic chemicals.\n\nMore:Residents seek answers over Ohio train derailment\n\nMcGuire said she had received reports from more than 20 families as of Feb. 13, and some of the animals were diagnosed by their veterinarian with vinyl chloride poisoning.\n\nTissue samples from a six-week-old beef calf that died Feb. 11 in an area about two miles from East Palestine have been sent to the Ohio Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory to see if a cause of death can be determined, according to a Feb. 16 news release from the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe department \"continues to assure Ohioans that its food supply is safe and the risk to livestock remains low,\" the release says.\n\nClaim: Dead fish and cattle have been reported hundreds of miles away\n\nSee this claim on social media (direct link, archive link)\n\nThere so far has been no evidence of harm to wildlife or livestock other than the roughly 3,500 fish killed in the immediate area of the derailment shortly after it happened, officials say.\n\nBrian Baldridge, director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, said at the Feb. 14 news conference that \"to this date, there is nothing we've seen in the livestock community that causes any concerns.\"\n\nA plume of contaminants is still slowly moving along the Ohio River, Tiffani Kavalec, who leads the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's division of surface water, said at the same news conference.\n\nMore:A strong stench, toxic water, and dead fish: What we know about the Ohio train derailment\n\nOfficials are tracking the plume in real time and expect treatment and the closing of water intakes to keep the chemicals out of local water systems, Kavalec said.\n\n\"The Ohio River is very large, and it's a water body that is able to dilute the pollutants pretty quickly,\" she said.\n\nThe plume was near Gallipolis, Ohio, as of Feb. 16 and is expected to be near Huntington, West Virginia, by Feb. 17, according to the Feb. 16 news release from the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNo vinyl chloride has been detected in the Ohio River, the release says.\n\nClaim: Journalists are being arrested in East Palestine\n\nSee this claim on social media (direct link, archive link)\n\nA single journalist was arrested at a press conference in East Palestine, but the charges have since been dropped.\n\nEvan Lambert, a reporter for News Nation, was arrested Feb. 8 while delivering a live report on DeWine's news conference about the train derailment as a press conference was ongoing.\n\nMore:Reporter arrested during Ohio train derailment briefing\n\nFact check: Post misleads on journalist arrests after Ohio derailment\n\nA Columbiana County Sheriff's Office spokesperson previously told USA TODAY that Lambert was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, both of which are misdemeanor charges.

And behind the scenes at the court, the 83-year-old justice is known for trying to build consensus, even as the court grew more conservative, and he worked against the odds.\n\nThe bespectacled Breyer, who often quotes British humorist P.G. Wodehouse and retells his grandchildren’s jokes, has conversed easily with all eight of his colleagues, dodging the friction of clashing ideologies and personalities.\n\nAs such, Breyer will leave a hole in the fabric of the court when he officially steps down later this year. More than most of his colleagues, he worked to bridge the conservative-liberal divide that was long 5-4 and now is 6-3.\n\nSupreme Court Justices (L-R) Scalia, Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter, Chief Rehnquist, Thomas, O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy in formal portrait in 1994. Diana Walker/The Chronicle Collection/Getty Images\n\nAny successor would presumably lack Breyer’s Washington experience. But a replacement would bring new youthfulness to the left side of the bench and, if President Joe Biden fulfills a campaign promise, would mean the first Black female justice in the court’s history.\n\nAmong Breyer’s notable moves at the center of the court: helping craft a compromise with Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act and casting the decisive vote in 2005 regarding displays of the Ten Commandments. His solo concurring statement allowed a 40-year-old monument at the Texas Capitol to remain in place – but meant framed Ten Commandment displays in Kentucky courthouses had to be removed.\n\nOne of Breyer’s most robust opinions emerged as he protested a 2007 majority decision striking down school integration plans in Seattle and in Louisville, Kentucky. The plans, which allowed consideration of students’ race in school assignments, were intended to offset neighborhood housing patterns and bring districtwide diversity.\n\n“This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret,” Breyer wrote, adding that Roberts and the conservatives who joined him had undermined the promise of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school-desegregation landmark.\n\nBreyer had been reared in San Francisco, where his parents were active in the community and local schools. His father, Irving Breyer, a lawyer, served the San Francisco school district. Justice Breyer still wears the Omega Seamaster wristwatch his father was given upon retirement.\n\nDuring the earlier stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, Breyer regularly decamped with his wife, a daughter and three grandchildren to the family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But he remained active on Zoom, appearing before legal groups and students.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is photographed at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September 2015.

He quipped in interviews that their ritual handshakes before each of their meetings had been replaced with elbow bumps, as a precaution against the virus. “We’re rubbing elbows,” he said, holding up his elbow and rotating it midair.\n\nIn an expansive interview with CNN in October, Breyer defended the high court against criticism that it engages in politics or requires institutional revisions such as term limits for justices or seats beyond the current nine.\n\n“It’s an institution that’s fallible, though over time it has served this country pretty well,” he said. Of his own approach, Breyer added, “Once you put on the robe of the judge, you’re a judge. And that means you’re a judge for every person. Every person won’t like your decisions. A lot will dislike them. … You still have to remember that you are there for everybody.”\n\nIn a book he published last year, adapted from a lecture at Harvard, Breyer maintained that the justices were not as politically divided as they appeared, now split between six Republican-appointed conservatives and three Democrat-appointed liberals.\n\nHe insisted that differences with his colleagues flowed from their distinct views of the structure of the Constitution. Yet in classic Breyer style, he had a three-point caveat to his claim that judging and politics don’t mix: “[I]t is wrong to think of the Court as another political institution. And it is doubly wrong to think of its Members as junior league politicians. But, given 1) the highly general language of the Constitution; 2) the ambiguous relationship between jurisprudence, political philosophy, and policy, and 3) the inevitable, conscious or unconscious impact of a human being’s background upon his or her basic professional views, to find a total divorce between the two is not quite right either.”\n\nHow Breyer got to the bench\n\nPresident Bill Clinton appointed Breyer to succeed the retiring Justice Harry Blackmun in 1994. Breyer previously had been a US appellate judge in Boston. An architecture enthusiast, he oversaw (as chief judge on the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals) construction of a dramatic federal courthouse overlooking Boston Harbor and distinguished by an 88-foot glass wall that faces the water.\n\nBreyer’s legal career began at the Supreme Court, where he was a law clerk to Justice Arthur Goldberg. In the 1970s, he served as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, assisting Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who strongly recommended Breyer to Clinton.\n\nIn his Senate work, Breyer focused on criminal sentencing guidelines and airline deregulation. As a judge, he continued to support agency solutions, especially in the face of court conservatives trying to rein in regulators. He also highlighted the importance of individual participation in civic life.\n\n“For our government to remain a democratic republic,” he wrote in a dissenting opinion in 2020 that touched on both themes, “the people must be free to generate, debate, and discuss both general and specific ideas, hopes, and experiences. The people must then be able to transmit their resulting views and conclusions to their elected representatives. The object of that transmission is to influence the public policy enacted by elected representatives.”\n\nThen-Supreme Court nominee Judge Stephen Breyer speaks with reporters in May 1994 in the White House Rose Garden as US President Bill Clinton listens. ROBERT GIROUX/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe spoke as he wrote. To lawyers who argued before the justices, Breyer offered multi-part questions. His hypothetical scenarios grew wilder through the years, and he would inevitably leaven his queries with a self-deprecating remark. “This question may seem naive and simple-minded,” he said during one 2021 argument, “but I don’t mean it to be.”\n\nFluent in French, Breyer has sometimes invoked Albert Camus’ “The Plague” in oral arguments and speeches.\n\nDuring 2021 oral arguments in a case testing when police without a warrant may enter a home under certain emergency circumstances, he began a scenario: “A baby’s been crying for five hours; nobody seems to be around. A rat’s come out of the house at a time when rats carry serious disease and have to be stopped.” Breyer later added in the same colloquy: “Try reading ‘The Plague.’ Try reading something where a rat coming out of a house could give people bubonic plague. I mean, you know, it’s easy to invent hypotheticals.”\n\nModerate liberal rulings\n\nThe late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the high court a year before Breyer, as Clinton’s first appointee, and she more prominently carried the banner for liberals. So, too, has Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a 2009 appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\nBreyer has partnered most with Justice Elena Kagan, who was named by Obama in 2010. They have been allies in trying to work with the individual justices on the right. In 2012, when Roberts broke from his conservative brethren to uphold the Obamacare law, he conferred with Breyer and Kagan for compromises on the individual insurance mandate and Medicaid expansion.\n\nLast year, when the justices rejected a challenge to Obamacare for the third time, Roberts assigned the opinion to Breyer, who wrote a narrow, consensus decision outright rejecting the claims. The court said the Republican-led states and other challengers lacked legal “standing” because they had suffered no injury related to the law. The case had centered on a tax penalty in the Affordable Care Act that Congress zeroed out in 2017.\n\nBreyer’s moderate liberalism has also led him to a leading role in a string of abortion-rights cases. His moderate approach, acknowledging the various interests, enabled him to keep the requisite five votes for a majority, at least through 2020, when liberal Ginsburg died and was succeeded by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, an opponent of abortion rights.\n\n“We understand the controversial nature of the problem,” he wrote in a 2000 case. “Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.”\n\nIn 2016, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the crucial fifth vote for a Breyer opinion striking down a strict Texas abortion regulation on physicians and clinics.\n\nIn 2020, Breyer produced only a plurality opinion (with three liberal justices), as the court invalidated a similar Louisiana credentialing regulation for physicians who perform abortions. Roberts cast the fifth vote to strike down the law, but unlike Kennedy, who retired in 2018, Roberts would not join Breyer’s broader abortion-rights rationale.\n\nThe court’s view of abortion rights is certain to diminish – because of the strengthened conservative majority. Breyer dissented in late 2021 and again this month as the right wing repeatedly refused to prevent a Texas ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn a separate line of cases, Breyer has regularly criticized the US system of capital punishment but stopped short of the position taken by liberals of another era that the death penalty is plainly unconstitutional.\n\nIn a 2015 opinion, joined only by Ginsburg, he urged the justices to reconsider the constitutionality of capital punishment. He cited “three fundamental constitutional defects” in the death penalty: “(1) serious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and (3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death penalty’s penological purpose.”\n\nPerhaps Breyer’s most memorable writing came in the 2007 case known as Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, when the majority struck down a school integration plan that assigned students based on race.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer (L), David Souter and Anthony Kennedy (R) attend a news conference at the Supreme Court to urge better pay for federal judges May 28, 2003, in Washington. David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images\n\n“For much of this Nation’s history, the races remained divided,” Breyer wrote. “It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court’s finest hour, Brown v. Board of Education challenged this history and helped to change it. … To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. The (Roberts) plurality’s position, I fear, would break that promise.”\n\nWhen he formally steps down, Breyer will have served 28 years. With his self-effacing style and emphasis on the dustier esoteric workings of government, he remained one of the least-known justices of his time. He sometimes made light of his relative anonymity.\n\nDuring the period that he and Justice David Souter (who served from 1990 to 2009) overlapped, the two balding, unassuming men, just a year apart in age, regularly joked about how often they were mistaken in public for each other. At a joint appearance in 2011 at Harvard Law School, the two men delighted in the double meaning of one possible response when people asked whether they were mistaken for each other: No, we are not “mistaken,” but perhaps we are “confused.”", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter and fired its top executives ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, a source familiar with the deal told CNN Thursday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/11/13/supreme-courts-code-of-conduct-gaza-hospitals-apec-mondays-news/71571517007/", "title": "Supreme Court's code of conduct, Gaza hospitals, APEC: Monday's ...", "text": "The Supreme Court adopted its first code of conduct.

It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/politics/supreme-court-june-opinions/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court has 29 opinions remaining in one-month sprint to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the Supreme Court rounds the final weeks of the term it has yet to decide an unusually high number of cases including disputes over abortion, gun rights, religious liberty, immigration and the environment – issues that deeply divide the public and exacerbate the ideological split on the 6-3 conservative-liberal court.\n\nJune is always a fraught time at the court, as several justices have openly acknowledged in speeches over the years. But this spring is different. Not only are the nine judges reshaping contours of social issues that drive the public debate, but they are also working to salvage the institutional legitimacy of their own branch of government.\n\nThe court released one opinion Wednesday – on a case involving a US Border Patrol agent – and has 29 remaining.\n\nIn addition, the justices are dealing with unprecedented turmoil triggered by an internal investigation. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the Marshal of the Court to find the person who breached internal protocols and leaked the draft opinion that would reverse Roe v.

He compared the leak to an “infidelity.”\n\nHere are the highlights of the court’s docket:\n\nAbortion\n\nIt was Thomas, the longest serving justice on the current court, who likely assigned fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito to write the draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The dispute concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The state is asking the justices to take the giant step of overturning Roe v. Wade, a seminal case decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAt oral arguments, Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart told the justices that Roe and a follow up decision from 1992 “haunt” the country.\n\nAt one time Mississippi’s law was dismissed as blatantly unconstitutional, even by a conservative-leaning appellate court. But much has changed since then, including the fact that in December the justices allowed a six-week ban on abortions in Texas to remain in effect. Since then, red states, invigorated by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, have passed increasingly restrictive laws. Last month, for example, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that bans abortions from the stage of “fertilization” and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman obtain the procedure.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito said that Roe “must be overruled.” If the five-member majority holds, it will wipe away near 50-year-old precedent and change the landscape of women’s reproductive health going forward.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are clinging to the fact that Alito’s opinion was a draft and hope it only reflects an opening salvo written after the justices casted initial votes at conference.\n\nVotes can change during deliberations. Sometimes majority opinions fizzle into concurrences or even dissents. Other justices could be simultaneously working on separate opinions, hoping to pick off votes from Alito’s draft or to weaken the thrust of his opinion.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nAs the country grapples with gun violence, the justices will decide how broadly they want to rule in a case that could open up a new chapter in constitutional challenges to gun safety laws.\n\nAfter oral arguments last year, it seemed the conservatives were ready to strike down a New York law – enacted more than a century ago – that places restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. Supporters of gun rights have been pushing the court to clarify the scope of the Second Amendment for years. The effort has been led by Thomas who in the past called the Second Amendment a “disfavored right in this court.”\n\nBut the entire landscape of the debate has shifted in recent months. Since the justices began deliberating, mass shootings have occurred across the country including a Texas massacre of 19 school children in Texas. While the shootings did not directly implicate the issue of concealed carry, the country as a whole is now debating gun safety laws.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nOn top of abortion and gun rights, the court is also considering cases that could allow more religion in public life.\n\nIn December, they heard arguments concerning a Maine initiative that excludes some religious schools from a tuition assistance program. The program allows parents living in rural areas with no school district to use vouchers to send their children to public or private schools elsewhere. But it came under challenge when some parents wanted to use the vouchers to send their kids to religious schools.\n\nThe court could insist that if a state provides vouchers for public and private education, it cannot exclude schools that teach the curriculum through the lens of faith.\n\nThe justices are also grappling with the case of Joe Kennedy, a former Washington state high school football coach at a public school who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after games.\n\nKennedy told CNN that “every American should be able to have faith in public and not be worried about being fired over it.”\n\n“I think it is important to keep our promises – especially to God,” he said.\n\nBut the school district said it suspended Kennedy to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a particular faith, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe liberal justices on the court – Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor –made clear at oral arguments that they were worried about players feeling coerced by the school to pray.\n\n“I’m going to just sort of suggest,” Kagan began “the idea of why the school can discipline him is that it puts some kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion, on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion,” she said.\n\nImmigration\n\nAs the political branches spar over immigration, the justices are considering several cases concerning border disputes.\n\nIn one case, a group of Republican-led states are seeking to step in and defend a controversial Trump-era immigration policy, a version of which the Biden administration abandoned. The policy – an expansion of the “public charge rule” – has been excised by the Biden administration.\n\nThe case does not center on the legality of the rule, but, instead, whether the Biden administration followed proper procedures when it set out to revoke the rule and dismiss pending legal challenges. The Trump policy made it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use certain public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. The justices could reinvigorate legal challenges.\n\nIn a separate dispute, the justices are grappling with whether the Biden administration can terminate a Trump-era border policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” Lower courts have so far blocked Biden from ending the policy.\n\nUnder the unprecedented program launched in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security can send certain-non Mexican citizens who entered the United States back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out. Critics call the policy inhumane and say it exposes asylum seekers with credible claims to dangerous and squalid conditions. The case raises questions not only regarding immigration law, but also a president’s control over policy and his diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe justices unexpectedly also agreed to decide a case concerning the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, in a dispute that could cripple the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions. It comes at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nThe court’s decision to step in now concerned environmentalists because there is currently no rule in place. A lower court wiped away a Trump era rule in 2021 and the Biden administration’s EPA is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBut the fact that there were enough votes to take up the issue now, struck some as an aggressive grant, signaling the court wants to limit the scope of the EPA’s authority even before a new rule is on the books.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/01/07/denn-creates-civil-rights-office-doj/21391309/", "title": "Denn creates civil rights office at DOJ", "text": "Jonathan Starkey and Jessica Masulli Reyes\n\nThe News Journal\n\nOn his second day on the job, Attorney General Matt Denn created a new office within the Department of Justice with a broad mandate to enforce civil rights laws, prosecute public corruption and review police-involved shootings, among other duties.\n\nThe new Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust will largely be guided by public and state agency complaints about constitutional rights issues, housing and employment discrimination, educational rights of children, and the rights of Delawareans with disabilities.\n\n\"We want (the public) to know if they feel that there has been something that has happened that shouldn't have, that there is an office in the Attorney General's Office that they can call,\" Denn said. \"And my guess is that people will call.\"\n\nAllison Reardon, who most recently served as head of the Attorney General's civil division as state solicitor, will lead the new office and will report to Danielle Gibbs, Denn's chief deputy.\n\nReardon's division will attempt to address conflicts of interest within the attorney general's office.\n\nLawyers who provide legal advice for the Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families will now operate separately from Justice Department lawyers who investigate when a child under state supervision is seriously injured or dies.\n\nLikewise, Denn suggested that shifting the responsibility to review police shootings into a new division could help ease the appearance of conflicts for lawyers at DOJ who regularly deal with law enforcement officers on criminal prosecution. A special investigations unit of the Attorney General's office currently reviews cases in which police use deadly force.\n\n\"Some of this is the result of my having spoken with the attorneys in the office and this issue of internal conflicts and confusion about roles is something that came up frequently,\" Denn said.\n\nRichard Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP who has called for policing reforms, said Denn is \"doing the right thing\" by making civil rights a priority, but says any unit investigating police shootings should act independently of the Justice Department's leadership. Reardon will report to Denn through Gibbs, and will not operate with independence.\n\n\"The unit should be independent and have their own power to make decisions,\" Smith said.\n\nFred Calhoun, leader of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police who represents about 2,500 retired and active police officers, said there is no need for an independent review of shootings. Calhoun said placing reviews in the new office does not raise concerns for police.\n\nThe FOP, as well as the Delaware State Troopers Association, two police unions, endorsed Denn's campaign for attorney general.\n\n\"I don't believe we, the law enforcement community and attorney general's office, are really in need of a drastic change,\" Calhoun said. \"We are not like other states that have had issues.\"\n\nAlong with the announcement of the new office, Denn revealed details of his leadership team on Wednesday.\n\nState Prosecutor Kathy Jennings keeps her job overseeing criminal prosecutions, a role she held under Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\nMeredith Stewart Tweedie, who ran the department's health unit, was promoted to state solicitor, overseeing civil cases. Matt Lintner, who heads the office prosecuting consumer fraud, kept his job. So did well-respected Family Division Director Patricia Dailey Lewis\n\nEmily Cunningham, who worked as chief of staff to Denn when he was lieutenant governor, will serve as deputy to Chief of Staff Greg Patterson in the attorney general's office.\n\nDenn also promised Wednesday that lawyers in the new division will target public corruption, enforce election laws and work with the state's woefully underfunded Public Integrity Commission to enforce laws governing the conduct of public employees and high-ranking state officials.\n\nE. Norman Veasey, a former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and special prosecutor appointed by then-Attorney General Beau Biden to probe campaign finance corruption, called the office a \"very good idea.\"\n\n\"This whole problem of gift-giving to public officials and circumvention of principles of campaign finance, like using the corporate entity loophole, those things need to be addressed,\" Veasey said.\n\nVeasey, who was paid $1 million by state taxpayers to pursue public corruption, secured guilty pleas in state court from liquor executive Chris Tigani and Dover developer Michael Zimmerman for illegal straw donor schemes – reimbursing other donors to circumvent election laws.\n\nTigani also spent time in federal prison for tax fraud and violations of federal campaign finance laws. His illegal reimbursement scheme here included donations to Markell, Beau Biden, Denn and others.\n\nIt's unclear whether Denn, a Democrat, will use the new office to push for stricter campaign finance laws. He said the foremost concern for the Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is on \"fact-based issues,\" but if legislative concerns arise the office may work with lawmakers.\n\nIn the wake of Veasey's report, lawmakers resisted his calls to ban corporate entity contributions, ban gifts to public officials and provide resources for the Public Integrity Commission.\n\nThe commission acts as the state's ethics watchdog with oversight of 48,000 government employees, but has just two employees of its own and an operating budget of $193,500, which, after salaries, falls to $30,600. Rhode Island's ethics office was funded by $1.5 million in 2013, Veasey pointed out.\n\n\"I think it's great that the attorney general's office has recognized our need to have a partner responsible for enforcing the criminal penalties provided for in the State's Code of Conduct,\" said Deborah Moreau, the lawyer who heads Delaware's Public Integrity Commission. \"We are looking forward to working with the new division.\"\n\nThe new office will also \"have a better working relationship\" with the State Auditor and Elections Commissioner when concerns arise, Denn said.\n\nDenn hopes the relationship the new office will have with the public will be equally as strong.\n\n\"It will actually generate some calls from people who might not have known where to go,\" he said.\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.

Here's why experts are worried ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA million bears walking on the streets of Hong Kong. A strawberry frog. A cat made out of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThese are just a few of the text descriptions that people have fed to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems in recent weeks, which these systems — notably OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Google Research’s Imagen — can use to produce incredibly detailed, realistic-looking images.\n\nThe resulting pictures can be silly, strange, or even reminiscent of classic art, and they’re being shared widely (and sometimes breathlessly) on social media, including by influential figures in the tech community. DALL-E 2 (which is a newer version of a similar, less capable AI system OpenAI rolled out last year) can also edit existing images by adding or taking out objects\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine such on-demand image generation eventually serving as a powerful tool for making all kinds of creative content, whether it be art or ads; DALL-E 2 and a similar such system, Midjourney, have already been used to help create magazine covers. OpenAI and Google have pointed to a few ways the technology might be commercialized, such as for editing images or creating stock images.\n\nNeither DALL-E 2 nor Imagen is currently available to the public. Yet they share an issue with many others that already are: they can also produce disturbing results that reflect the gender and cultural biases of the data on which they were trained — data that includes millions of images pulled from the internet.\n\nAn image created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe bias in these AI systems presents a serious issue, experts told CNN Business. The technology can perpetuate hurtful biases and stereotypes. They’re concerned that the open-ended nature of these systems — which makes them adept at generating all kinds of images from words — and their ability to automate image-making means they could automate bias on a massive scale. They also have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation.\n\n“Until those harms can be prevented, we’re not really talking about systems that can be used out in the open, in the real world,” said Arthur Holland Michel, a senior fellow at Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs who researches AI and surveillance technologies.\n\nDocumenting bias\n\nAI has become common in everyday life in the past few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice — both of how common it is, and how gender, racial, and other types of biases can creep into the technology. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and racial bias.\n\nOpenAI and Google Research have acknowledged many of the issues and risks related to their AI systems in documentation and research, with both saying that the systems are prone to gender and racial bias and to depicting Western cultural stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n\nOpenAI, whose mission is to build so-called artificial general intelligence that benefits all people, included in an online document titled “Risks and limitations” pictures illustrating how text prompts can bring up these issues: A prompt for “nurse”, for instance, resulted in images that all appeared to show stethoscope-wearing females, while one for “CEO” showed images that all appeared to be men and nearly all of them were white.\n\nLama Ahmad, policy research program manager at OpenAI, said researchers are still learning how to even measure bias in AI, and that OpenAI can use what it learns to tweak its AI over time. Ahmad led OpenAI’s efforts to work with a group of outside experts earlier this year to better understand issues within DALL-E 2 and offer feedback so it can be improved.\n\nGoogle declined a request for an interview from CNN Business. In its research paper introducing Imagen, the Google Brain team members behind it wrote that Imagen appears to encode “several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.”\n\nThe contrast between the images these systems create and the thorny ethical issues is stark for Julie Carpenter, a research scientist and fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\n“One of the things we have to do is we have to understand AI is very cool and it can do some things very well. And we should work with it as a partner,” Carpenter said. “But it’s an imperfect thing. It has its limitations. We have to adjust our expectations. It’s not what we see in the movies.”\n\nAn image created by an AI system called DALL-E 2, built by OpenAI. OpenAI\n\nHolland Michel is also concerned that no amount of safeguards can prevent such systems from being used maliciously, noting that deepfakes — a cutting-edge application of AI to create videos that purport to show someone doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say — were initially harnessed to create faux pornography.\n\n“It kind of follows that a system that is orders of magnitude more powerful than those early systems could be orders of magnitude more dangerous,” he said.\n\nHint of bias\n\nBecause Imagen and DALL-E 2 take in words and spit out images, they had to be trained with both types of data: pairs of images and related text captions. Google Research and OpenAI filtered harmful images such as pornography from their datasets before training their AI models, but given the large size of their datasets such efforts are unlikely catch all such content, nor render the AI systems unable to produce harmful results. In its Imagen paper, Google researchers pointed out that, despite filtering some data, they also used a massive dataset that is known to include porn, racist slurs, and “harmful social stereotypes.”\n\nFiltering can also lead to other issues: Women tend to be represented more than men in sexual content, for instance, so filtering out sexual content also reduces the number of women in the dataset, said Ahmad.\n\nAnd truly filtering these datasets for bad content is impossible, Carpenter said, since people are involved in decisions about how to label and delete content — and different people have different cultural beliefs.\n\n“AI doesn’t understand that,” she said.\n\nSome researchers are thinking about how it might be possible to reduce bias in these types of AI systems, but still use them to create impressive images. One possibility is using less, rather than more, data.\n\nAlex Dimakis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said one method involves starting with a small amount of data — for example, a photo of a cat — and cropping it, rotating it, creating a mirror image of it, and so on, to effectively turn one picture into many different images. (A graduate student Dimakis advises was a contributor to the Imagen research, but Dimakis himself was not involved in the system’s development, he said.)\n\n“This solves some of the problems, but it doesn’t solve other problems,” Dimakis said. The trick on its own won’t make a dataset more diverse, but the smaller scale could let people working with it be more intentional about the images they’re including.\n\nRoyal raccoons\n\nFor now, OpenAI and Google Research are trying to keep the focus on cute pictures and away from images that may be disturbing or show humans.\n\nThere are no realistic-looking images of people in the vibrant sample images on either Imagen’s nor DALL-E 2’s online project page, and OpenAI says on its page that it used “advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures.” This safeguard could prevent users from getting image results for, say, a prompt that attempts to show a specific politician performing some kind of illicit activity.\n\nOpenAI has provided access to DALL-E 2 to thousands of people who signed up to a waitlist since April. Participants must agree to an extensive content policy, which tells users to not try to make, upload, or share pictures “that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” DALL-E 2 also uses filters to prevent it from generating a picture if a prompt or image upload violates OpenAI’s policies, and users can flag problematic results. In late June, OpenAI started allowing users to post photorealistic human faces created with DALL-E 2 to social media, but only after adding some safety features, such as preventing users from generating images containing public figures.\n\n“Researchers, specifically, I think it’s really important to give them access,” Ahmad said. This is, in part, because OpenAI wants their help to study areas such as disinformation and bias.\n\nGoogle Research, meanwhile, is not currently letting researchers outside the company access Imagen. It has taken requests on social media for prompts that people would like to see Imagen interpret, but as Mohammad Norouzi, a co-author on the Imagen paper, tweeted in May, it won’t show images “including people, graphic content, and sensitive material.”\n\nStill, as Google Research noted in its Imagen paper, “Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.”\n\nA hint of this bias is evident in one of the images Google posted to its Imagen webpage, created from a prompt that reads: “A wall in a royal castle. There are two paintings on the wall. The one on the left a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon king. The one on the right a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon queen.”\n\nAn image of \"royal\" raccoons created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe image is just that, with paintings of two crowned raccoons — one wearing what looks like a yellow dress, the other in a blue-and-gold jacket — in ornate gold frames. But as Holland Michel noted, the raccoons are sporting Western-style royal outfits, even though the prompt didn’t specify anything about how they should appear beyond looking “royal.”\n\nEven such “subtle” manifestations of bias are dangerous, Holland Michel said.\n\n“In not being flagrant, they’re really hard to catch,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/tech/meta-ai-text-to-video-research/index.html", "title": "Meta is using AI to generate videos from just a few words | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nArtificial intelligence is getting better and better at generating an image in response to a handful of words, with publicly available AI image generators such as DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. Now, Meta researchers are taking AI a step further: they’re using it to concoct videos from a text prompt.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook on Thursday about the research, called Make-A-Video, with a 20-second clip that compiled several text prompts that Meta researchers used and the resulting (very short) videos. The prompts include “A teddy bear painting a self portrait,” “A spaceship landing on Mars,” “A baby sloth with a knitted hat trying to figure out a laptop,” and “A robot surfing a wave in the ocean.”\n\nThe videos for each prompt are just a few seconds long, and they generally show what the prompt suggests (with the exception of the baby sloth, which doesn’t look much like the actual creature), in a fairly low-resolution and somewhat jerky style. Even so, it demonstrates a fresh direction AI research is taking as systems become increasingly good at generating images from words. If the technology is eventually released widely, though, it will raise many of the same concerns sparked by text-to-image systems, such as that it could be used to spread misinformation via video.\n\nA web page for Make-A-Video includes these short clips and others, some of which look fairly realistic, such as a video created in response to the prompt “Clown fish swimming through the coral reef” or one meant to show “A young couple walking in a heavy rain.”\n\nIn his Facebook post, Zuckerberg pointed out how tricky it is to generate a moving image from a handful of words.\n\n“It’s much harder to generate video than photos because beyond correctly generating each pixel, the system also has to predict how they’ll change over time,” he wrote.\n\nA research paper describing the work explains that the project uses a text-to-image AI model to figure out how words correspond with pictures, and an AI technique known as unsupervised learning — in which algorithms pore over data that isn’t labeled to discern patterns within it — to look at videos and determine what realistic motion looks like.\n\nAs with massive, popular AI systems that generate images from text, the researchers pointed out that their text-to-image AI model was trained on internet data — which means it learned “and likely exaggerated social biases, including harmful ones,” the researches wrote. They did note that they filtered data for “NSFW content and toxic words,” but as datasets can include many millions of images and text, it may not be possible to remove all such content.\n\nZuckerberg wrote that Meta plans to share the Make-A-Video project as a demo in the future.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2019/07/12/ai-deepfake-fake-news-real-artificial-intelligence-realistic/1712573001/", "title": "Fake news is real — AI is going to make it much worse", "text": "Joe Andrews\n\nCNBC\n\n“The Boy Who Cried Wolf” has long been a staple on nursery room shelves for a reason: It teaches kids that joking too much about a possible threat may turn people ignorant when the threat becomes an actual danger.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been warning about “fake news” throughout his entire political career. And now the real wolf might be just around the corner.\n\nThe threat is called “deepfaking,” a product of AI and machine learning advancements that allows high-tech computers to produce completely false yet remarkably realistic videos depicting events that never happened or people saying things they never said. A viral video starring Jordan Peele and “Barack Obama” warned against this technology in 2018, but the message was not enough to keep Jim Carrey from starring in “The Shining” earlier this week.\n\nWait, is that video real?:The race against deepfakes\n\nDeepfake:Instagram won't remove deepfake of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThe danger goes far beyond manipulating 1980s thrillers. Deepfake technology is allowing organizations that produce fake news to augment their “reporting” with seemingly legitimate videos, blurring the line between reality and fiction like never before – and placing the reputation of journalists and the media at greater risk.\n\nBen Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago, thinks the age of getting news on social media makes consumers very susceptible to this sort of manipulation.\n\n“What the last couple years has shown is basically fake news is quite compelling even in (the) absence of actual proof. ... So the bar is low,” Zhao said.\n\nThe bar to produce a convincing doctored video is lower than people might assume.\n\n'Deepfake' videos:Can be generated with a single photo, research paper says\n\nFacebook:It's not deleting the fake Pelosi video. Should it?\n\nEarlier this year a clip purporting to show Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi slurring her words when speaking to the press was shared widely on social media, including at one point by Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani. However, closer inspection revealed that the video had been slowed to 75% of its normal speed to achieve this slurring effect, according to The Washington Post. Even with the real video now widely accessible, Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley’s School of Information and a digital forensics expert, said he still regularly receives emails from people insisting the slowed video is the legitimate one.\n\n“Even in these relatively simple cases, we are struggling to sort of set the record straight,” Farid said.\n\nIt would take a significant amount of expertise for a fake news outlet to produce a completely fabricated video of Oprah Winfrey endorsing Trump, but researchers say the technology is improving every day. At the University of Washington, computer vision researchers are developing this technology for positive, or at least benign, uses like making video conferencing more realistic and letting students talk to famous historical figures. But this research also leads to questions about potential dangers, as the attempts made by attackers are expected to continually improve.\n\nHow to detect a deepfake\n\nTo make one of these fake videos, computers digest thousands of still images of a subject to help researchers build a 3-D model of the person. This method has some limitations, according to Zhao, who noted the subjects in many deepfake videos today never blink, since almost all photographs are taken with a person’s eyes open.\n\nHowever, Farid said these holes in the technology are being filled incredibly rapidly.\n\n“If you asked me this question six months ago, I would’ve said, ‘Yeah, (the technology) is super cool, but there’s a lot of artifacts, and if you’re paying attention, you can probably tell that there’s something wrong,’” Farid said. “But I would say we are ... quickly but surely getting to the point where the average person is going to have trouble distinguishing.”\n\nIn fact, Zhao said researchers believe the shortcomings that make deepfake videos look slightly off to the eye can readily be fixed with better technology and better hardware.\n\n“The minute that someone says, ‘Here’s a research paper telling you about how to detect this kind of fake video,’ that is when the attackers look at the paper and say, ‘Thank you for pointing out my flaw. I will take that into account in my next-generation video, and I will go find enough input ... so that the next generation of my video will not have the same problem,’” Zhao said.\n\nDo you know what an FSA is?:It could save you $2,700 a year\n\nDrowning in student loan debt?:You may have to ditch your dream job\n\nOne of the more recent developments in this field is in generating speech for a video. To replicate a figure such as Trump’s voice, computers can now simply analyze hundreds of hours of him speaking. Then researchers can type out what they want Trump to say, and the computer will make it sound as if he actually said it. Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all more or less perfected this technology, according to Farid.\n\nManipulated videos of this sort aren’t exactly new – Forest Gump didn’t actually meet JFK, after all. However, Farid says this technology is hitting its stride, and that makes the danger new.\n\n“To me the threat is not so much ‘Oh, there’s this new phenomenon called deepfakes,’” Farid said. “It’s the injection of that technology into an existing environment of mistrust, misinformation, social media, a highly polarized electorate, and now I think there’s a real sort of amplification factor because when you hear people say things, it raises the level of belief to a whole new level.”\n\nThe prospect of widespread availability of this technology is raising eyebrows, too. Tech-savvy hobbyists have long been using deepfakes to manufacture pornography, a consistent and comically predictable trend for new technology. But Zhao believes it is only a matter of time before the research-caliber technology gets packaged and released for mass-video manipulation in much broader contexts.\n\n“At some point someone will basically take all these technologies and integrate and do the legwork to build a sort of fairly sophisticated single model, one-stop shop ... and when that thing hits and becomes easily accessible to many, then I think you’ll see this becoming much more prevalent,” Zhao said. “And there’s nothing really stopping that right now.”\n\nFacing a massive consumer trust issue\n\nWhen this happens, the journalism industry is going to face a massive consumer trust issue, according to Zhao. He fears it will be hard for top-tier media outlets to distinguish a real video from a doctored one, let alone news consumers who haphazardly stumble across the video on Twitter.\n\n“Once we live in an age where videos and images and audio can’t be trusted ... well, then everything can be fake,” Farid said. “We can have different opinions, but we can’t have different facts. And I think that’s sort of the world we’re entering into when we can’t believe anything that we see.”\n\nThinking about retirement?:Answer these 3 questions first\n\nElectric bills can be a pain:Here's where you'll pay the most for them\n\nZhao has spent a great deal of time speaking with prosecutors, judges – the legal profession is another sector where the implications are huge – reporters and other professors to get a sense for every nuance of the issue. However, despite his clear understanding of the danger deepfakes pose, he is still unsure of how news outlets will go about reacting to the threat.\n\n“Certainly, I think what can happen is ... there will be even less trust in sort of mainstream media, the main news outlets, legitimate journalists (that) sort of react and report real-time stories because there is a sense that anything that they have seen ... could be in fact made up,” Zhao said.\n\nThen it becomes a question of how the press deal with the disputes over reality.\n\n“And if it’s someone’s word, an actual eyewitness’ word versus a video, which do you believe, and how do you as an organization go about verifying the authenticity or the illegitimacy of a particularly audio or video?” Zhao asked.\n\nDefeating the deepfakes\n\nPart of this solution may be found in the ledger technology that provides the digital infrastructure to support cryptocurrencies like bitcoin – the blockchain. Many industries are touting blockchain as a sort of technological Tylenol. Though few understand exactly how it works, many swear it will solve their problems.\n\nFarid said companies like photo and video verification platform Truepic, to which he serves as an adviser, are using the blockchain to create and store digital signatures for authentically shot videos as they are being recorded, which makes them much easier to verify later. Both Zhao and Farid are hoping social platforms like Facebook and Twitter will then promote these videos that are verified as authentic over non-verified videos, helping to halt the spread of deepfakes.\n\n“The person creating the fake always has the upper hand,” Farid said. “Playing defense is really, really hard. So I think in the end our goal is not to eliminate these things, but it’s to manage the threat.”\n\nUntil this happens, Zhao said the fight against genuinely fake news may not start on a ledger, but in stronger consumer awareness and journalists banding together to better verify sources through third parties.\n\n“One of the hopes that I have for defeating this type of content is that people are just so inundated with news coverage and information about these types of videos that they become fundamentally much more skeptical about what a video means and they will look closer,” Zhao said. “There has to be that level of scrutiny by the consumer for us to have any chance of fighting back against this type of fake content.”\n\nNicholas Diakopoulos, assistant professor in Northwestern University’s School of Communication and expert on the future of journalism, said via email that the best solutions involve a mix of educational and sociotechnical advances.\n\n“There are a variety of perceptual cues that can be tip-offs to a deepfake and we should be teaching those broadly to the public,” he said.\n\nDiakopoulos has referenced Farid’s work on photo forensics among ideas outlined in an article he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review last year. He also cited a research project called FaceForensics that uses machine learning to detect, with 98.1% accuracy, whether a video of a face is real. Another research technique under study: Blood flow in video of a person’s face can be analyzed in order to see if pixels periodically get redder when the heart pumps blood.\n\n“On the sociotechnical side, we need to develop advanced forensics techniques that can help debunk synthesized media when put into the hands of trained professionals,” he told CNBC. “Rapid response teams of journalists should be trained and ready to use these tools during the 2020 elections so they can debunk disinformation as quickly as possible.”\n\n'We need change':Amazon workers are planning a labor strike on Prime Day\n\nThe best country to be a woman?:It's not the US\n\nDiakopoulos has studied the implications of deepfakes for the 2020 elections specifically. He also has written papers on how journalists need to think when “reporting in a machine reality.”\n\nAnd he remains optimistic.\n\n“If news organizations develop clear and transparent policies of their efforts using such tools to ensure the veracity of the content they publish, this should help buttress their trustworthiness. In an era when we can’t believe our eyes when we see something online, news organizations that are properly prepared, equipped and staffed are poised to become even more trusted sources of information.”\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But the White House hopes it will convince tech companies to take additional steps to protect consumers, including clearly explaining how and why an automated system is in use and designing AI systems to be equitable. The blueprint joins a number of other voluntary efforts to adopt rules regarding transparency and ethics in AI, which have come from government agencies, companies and non-government groups.\n\nThough the use of AI has proliferated in recent years — being used for everything from confirming people’s identities for unemployment benefits to generating a highly realistic picture in response to a written prompt — the US legislative landscape has not kept pace. There are no federal laws specifically regulating AI or applications of AI, such as facial-recognition software, which has been criticized by privacy and digital rights groups for years over privacy issues and leading to the wrongful arrests, of at least several Black men, among other issues.\n\nA handful of individual states have their own rules. Illinois, for instance, has a law known as the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which forces companies to get permission from people before collecting biometric data like fingerprints or scans of facial geometry. It also allows Illinois residents to sue companies for alleged violations of the law. Since 2019, a number of communities and some states have also banned the use of facial-recognition software in various ways, though a few have since pulled back on such rules.\n\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes five principles: That people should be protected from systems deemed “unsafe or ineffective;” that people shouldn’t be discriminated against via algorithms and that AI-driven systems should be made and used “in an equitable way;” that people should be kept safe “from abusive data practices” by safeguards built in to AI systems and have control over how data about them is used; that people should be aware when an automated system is in use and be aware of how it could affect them; and that people should be able to opt out of such systems “where appropriate” and get help from a person instead of a computer.\n\n“Much more than a set of principles, this is a blueprint to empower the American people to expect better and demand better from their technologies,” said Alondra Nelson, the deputy director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, during a press briefing.\n\nWhile some privacy and technology advocates responded positively to the guidelines, they also pointed out that they are just that, guidelines — and not legally binding.\n\nIn a statement, Alexandra Reeve Givens, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit, said, “Today’s agency actions are valuable, but they would be even more effective if they were built on a foundation set up by a comprehensive federal privacy law.”\n\nIn a separate statement, ReNika Moore, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program, called the principles “an important step in addressing the harms of AI” and added that “there should be no loopholes or carve-outs for these protections.”\n\n“It’s critical that the Biden administration use all levers available to make the promises of the Bill of Rights blueprint a reality,” Moore said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/tech/craiyon-dalle-mini-ai/index.html", "title": "This AI image generator lets you type in words and get weird ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIt only took Matt Laming, a 19-year-old from the United Kingdom, about a month to hit a million followers on Twitter. And all it required was sharing a steady stream of the most outlandish computer-generated images that he and a bunch of internet strangers could think up.\n\nIn recent weeks, the digital marketing apprentice, better known online as @weirddalle, has shared images depicting things like people vacuuming in the forest, the Demogorgon from Netflix’s “Stranger Things” holding a basketball, and a Beanie Baby that looks a lot like Danny DeVito.\n\nThese and other pictures, which range from ridiculous to disturbing, were created with a freely available artificial intelligence system called Craiyon. To use it, you just type what you’d like it to envision — “A rainbow lion eating a slice of pizza” — and it will spit out pictures in response.\n\n“I think that’s the main draw of it: You can make anything a reality,” Laming said in an interview with CNN Business.\n\nThe brainchild of Boris Dayma, a Houston-based machine-learning engineer, Craiyon is popularizing a growing trend in AI. Computers are getting better and better at ingesting words and producing increasingly realistic-looking images in response. Lately, people are typing in about 5 million prompts per day, Dayma said.\n\nThere are similar, much more powerful AI systems than Craiyon, such as OpenAI’s DALL-E (Craiyon was initially named DALL-E Mini as an homage) and DALL-E 2, as well as Google’s Imagen. But unlike Craiyon, which anyone can try, most of these are not available to the public: DALL-E 2 is open to users via invitation only, while Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nAn image generated by Craiyon, an AI system that anyone can use to feed text to a computer and get a picture in response. From Craiyon\n\n“I think it’s important to be able to have an alternative where everybody has the same access to this type of technology,” Dayma said.\n\nIn the process, however, Craiyon is effectively acting as a trial run for what could happen — good or bad — in the future if anyone can access such AI systems and solicit any kind of image from them with just a few words. And as with many nascent technologies, it is a work in progress; in the near term, if left unchecked, it may produce outcomes that reinforce stereotypes and biases.\n\nThe Notorious BFG\n\nDayma and some other coders built the AI system last July during a hackathon hosted by Google and Hugging Face, a company that builds and hosts AI models. Initially, Dayma said, he built it as a technical challenge; he thought DALL-E was cool and he wanted to make it himself. He posted the text-to-image generator — then called DALL-E Mini — on Hugging Face, where anyone could try it out (it’s still available there under that name). But it didn’t get much attention beyond the AI community until the past couple of months, perhaps due to the limited quality of the images it could produce.\n\nIn the past, for example, it would be able to envision simple things like a landscape, Dayma said. But little by little, he’s done things such as fixing bugs and improving code, enabling it to get better at coming up with more complicated images, such as the Eiffel Tower landing on the moon.\n\n“When the model started drawing that, I was very happy,” he said. “But then people came up with things even more creative, and somehow the model reached a moment where it was able to do something that looked like what they asked for, and I think that was a turning point.”\n\nThe images Craiyon generates are not nearly as realistic-looking as what DALL-E 2 or Imagen can come up with, but they’re fascinating nonetheless: People tend to blur into objects, and images look fuzzy and at least slightly askew.\n\nFor now, Craiyon is mostly being used for fun by people like Laming — perhaps in part because its results are not nearly as crisp or photorealistic as the images you can get from DALL-E 2 or Imagen, but also because people are still trying to figure out what to do with it. (The Craiyon website currently runs ads to recoup costs for the servers that power the AI system, and Dayma said he’s trying to figure out how to make money from it while also allowing people to play with it for free.)\n\nAn image generated by Craiyon, an AI system that anyone can use to feed text to a computer and get a picture in response. From Craiyon/weirddalle/Twitter\n\nMany of the images Laming posts to Twitter come from a Reddit forum he created for people to post the prompts and resulting images they got when they ran them through the system. This is the same approach he takes for another Twitter account he runs, @spotifyweird, which tweets strange Spotify playlists.\n\nLaming’s most popular tweet so far was a post on June 14 with the prompt “Fisher Price guillotine,” which was initially posted to his subreddit by a Reddit user. Popular posts may take an item from news or pop culture and mash it up with something completely random or shocking or gross — such as Minions-themed urinals — or simply come up with a funny play on words (think “The Notorious BFG” or “Ice Cube in an ice cube”).\n\nAs users get more familiar with the kinds of results Craiyon can produce, the prompts get increasingly specific in terms of the types of imagery they want to see — such as calling for a medical illustration of a burrito or courtroom sketches showing what it might look like if a capybara sued Elon Musk. Sometimes they’re just really weird, such as in this depiction of archaeologists discovering a plastic chair.\n\nTo come up with a good prompt, Laming suggested, just “think of the most outlandish situation to put someone or something in.” In effect, the prompts that lead to these pictures are themselves arguably a new form of creativity.\n\nBiases on display\n\nMar Hicks, an associate professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology who studies the history of technology, said this AI system reminds them of early chatbots such as Eliza, a computer program built by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s and meant to mimic a therapist. Such programs could convince people they were communicating with another human, even though the computer didn’t truly understand what it was being told (Eliza gave scripted responses).\n\n“I think it’s appealing the same way that a game of chance is appealing, or a party game,” Hicks said. “Where there’s some level of uncertainty about what’s going to happen.”\n\nBut Hicks is concerned about the AI system’s ability to respond to any written prompt with images, rather than occasionally giving an error message indicating it doesn’t know how to parse the phrases a person typed. “That means you will be getting garbage out some times,” they said, and the onus is on the users to figure out why. This was the case with some prompts I fed Craiyon, making it occasionally disappointing and frustrating to use, but Dayma pointed out that it’s not easy to predict what it can or can’t draw, and sometimes the results are surprising, or at least surprisingly weird.\n\nDayma said he’s heard from people using Craiyon to come up with a logo for a new business and as imagery in videos. (OpenAI and Google have suggested that their systems might eventually be used for things like image editing and generating stock images.)\n\nAn image showing how the AI system Craiyon, initially known as DALL-E Mini, got better at generating images over time for the prompt \"the Eiffel Tower is landing on the moon\". Courtesy Boris Dayma/Craiyon\n\nWhile there may be creative possibilities for these AI systems, they share a key problem that pervades the AI industry at large: bias. They’re all trained on data that includes wide swaths of the internet, which means the images they create can also lay bare a host of biases including gender, racial, and social stereotypes.\n\nSuch biases are evident even in Craiyon’s fuzzy-looking images. And because anyone can type anything they want into it, it can be a disturbing window into how stereotypes can seep into AI. I recently gave Craiyon the prompt “a lawyer”, for instance, and the results were all blurry images of what appeared to be men in black judge’s robes. The prompt “a teacher,” meanwhile, yielded only figures that appeared to be women, each in a button-down shirt.\n\nDayma is aware of this. A “Frequently asked questions” section on Craiyon’s website mentions that the model’s reliance on internet data may result in “images that contain harmful stereotypes,” and that those behind Craiyon are working to document and analyze its biases. Dayma noted that many AI systems are biased, whether or not users are aware of it, and said he likes that everyone can observe Craiyon’s biases directly in the images it makes.\n\nHe also said that he tried to prevent the model behind Craiyon from learning certain concepts to start with. However, it only took me a few minutes to come up with some explicit prompts that yielded images that are, to put it bluntly, not safe for work.\n\nAsked whether he thinks its general availability could be a bad thing, given its obvious biases, he pointed out that the images it comes up with, while better-looking than in the past, are clearly not realistic.\n\n“If I draw the Eiffel Tower on the moon, I hope nobody believes the Eiffel Tower is really on the moon,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/us/dumpy-huge-frog-tiktok-trnd/index.html", "title": "Dumpy, the TikTok-famous giant frog, is fake -- well, kinda | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA video of a massive, banana-guzzling frog, easily the size of its owner’s head, garnered over 20 million views on TikTok. But it was all thanks to movie magic, according to its creator.\n\nThe video inspired shock and amazement. Posted to TikTok on Thursday, the clip shows videographer Lucas Peterson touching and feeding a huge amphibian named Dumpy.\n\nBut, as the Minnesota-based content creator explained to CNN, Dumpy, a 4-year-old Australian green tree frog, is actually only about the size of his palm. Peterson edited the video in Adobe Premiere to make him appear much larger.\n\nThere are also a “whole lot of perspective tricks going on” to help the video appear realistic, Peterson said.\n\nHe said he hoped to inspire debate over whether or not the clip was real – this kind of ambiguity increases engagement on his content. “It causes a question and more interaction, debate over whether it’s real or fake,” he said. He previously posted a similarly edited video of the supersized frog.\n\nBut still, he was surprised by the massive reach of Thursday’s enlarged Dumpy video. “I didn’t expect people to go that wild over a giant frog,” he said.\n\nPeterson explained that the video was edited in the description of the original TikTok, writing: “His real size is about 4-5 inches he’s enlarged with vfx perspective tricks. I did all my editing in adobe premiere.” However, his disclaimer was buried around halfway into the video description – and as Peterson told CNN, copies of his original video without the caption also began circulating on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram, leading many viewers to believe the clip was real.\n\nBut the video’s viral fame has given Peterson an opportunity to share information about his semi-aquatic pets, he said. He maintains a “paludarium,” a kind of enclosed terrarium with aquatic features, that is home to Dumpy and two salamanders.\n\n“This opened the door to help educate people about how great tanks and amphibians are,” he said. “It’s kind of a niche hobby.”\n\nIn the future, he plans to release more content starring Dumpy and his other amphibians. “Dumpy is still the same loveable frog you see on the screen, the only thing that’s different is he was enlarged,” he said.\n\nSo, while you don’t have to watch out for oversized frogs anytime soon, you might want to watch out for some editing in the next unbelievable viral video you see.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/tech/meta-metaverse-transition/index.html", "title": "Facebook became Meta one year ago. Its metaverse dream feels as ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nEven by Facebook’s standards, 2021 was a rough year.\n\nA series of damning reports based on leaks from a whistleblower raised uncomfortable questions about Facebook’s impact on society; the company continued reeling from concerns about the use of its platform to organize the January 6 Capitol riot; and privacy changes from Apple threatened its core advertising business. Meanwhile, young users were flocking to TikTok.\n\nAt a virtual reality event on October 28, 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to turn the page. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would change its name to Meta and go all in on building a future version of the internet called the “metaverse,” proving to all in the process that the company he launched in 2004 was more than just a social media business.\n\nOne year and billions of dollars later, the so-called metaverse still feels years away, if it ever manifests at all. And the company formerly known as Facebook remains very much a social media business — one that is facing more financial pressure than when it announced the change.\n\nA sign in front of Meta headquarters on April 28, 2022 in Menlo Park, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMeta’s Quest 2 consumer virtual-reality headset, released two years ago, is popular in its category but remains a niche product overall. Its newest headset, the much pricier $1,500 Quest Pro, is intended for enterprise customers and likely won’t move the needle with everyday consumers. And Meta’s flagship social VR app Horizon Worlds can feel like a ghost town (albeit a ghost town with laser tag).\n\nWhile some brands have since made measured bets on the metaverse, including by hiring “chief metaverse officers,” it’s not clear whether consumers actually want to work or play in it, or even know what the hard-to-define term means. The metaverse refers, generally, to a sort of virtual world that people can walk around in, as well as the idea of making the internet more ubiquitous and interconnected.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s core business is contracting as it confronts growing competition from TikTok and an advertising industry in retreat amid looming recession fears. The company this week reported its second-ever quarterly drop in revenue and saw profit cut in half from the prior year. It’s selling more ads but making less money on them, and user growth on its social media platforms is slowing. After hitting a $1 trillion market cap for the first time last summer, it’s now worth about a quarter of that, or less than Home Depot.\n\n“The business is not growing in 2022,” said Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson. “There is expectation that it will grow going forward, but that expectation may prove to be optimistic.”\n\nA bet that looked bold a year ago now looks borderline unhinged. Meta lost $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022 on its metaverse efforts and expects losses from the unit to “grow significantly year-over-year” in 2023. This has prompted even some of Meta’s supporters to urge it to rethink its strategy shift, and possibly slow it down. (It also prompted a tearful Jim Cramer, host of “Mad Money,” to apologize to viewers for trusting Meta’s management team and recommending that investors buy the stock.)\n\n“People are confused by what the metaverse even means. If the company were investing $1-2B per year into this project, then that confusion might not even be a problem. You would simply do R&D quietly and investors would focus on the core business,” Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, a shareholder in Meta, wrote in an open letter to Zuckerberg this week. He urged Meta to “cap its metaverse investments to no more than $5B per year with more discrete targets and measures of success.”\n\nThe current pace of spending, he added, “is super-sized and terrifying, even by Silicon Valley standards.”\n\nMeta did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nA sudden shift years in the making\n\nThough the name change was just announced a year ago, the shift from Facebook to Meta has been years in the making. Zuckerberg has said in the past that it’s a long-term bet for the company — not an overnight transformation. It began with Facebook’s 2014 purchase of Oculus VR, and in the years since, the company has rolled out a series of headsets that are increasingly capable, affordable and portable.\n\nMeta’s latest headset, the Quest Pro, is its first effort at combining the immersiveness of VR with the real world. It can display text and fine details in VR, track your eyes and facial features to give you a sense of connection with other people in virtual spaces, and show you a view of the world around you in color while letting you interact with digital objects — all nods toward Meta’s goal of attracting more business users.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the Oculus Rift headset available in 2016: That cost $599, but users also had to connect it to a powerful PC and use it with a sensor camera on a stand that tracked the headset. At first, that headset didn’t even come with tracked hand controllers; it initially shipped to customers with an Xbox controller and a small handheld remote.\n\nAlthough the headsets have improved dramatically, VR and AR are still nascent technologies searching for purpose and popularity. The VR headset market is still tiny compared to, say, an established gadget market like console video games. ABI Research expects 11.1 million VR headsets will ship out this year, about 70% of which it predicts will be Quest 2 headsets. That’s a drop from its estimate of 14.5 million headsets in 2021, of which Quest 2 headsets made up 85% of the total.\n\nThere’s potential for these products, some technology experts say, including in the workplace, but in the near term its adoption by everyday users remains uncertain at best.\n\n“I’m not sure this is going to translate to end-user consumers any time soon,” said David Lindlbauer, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s Augmented Perception Lab. (Meta is sponsoring Lindlbauer’s research into developing advanced user interfaces for AR and VR.)\n\nA headset is not a smartphone\n\nFor Zuckerberg, and Meta, that creates a unique challenge.\n\nZuckerberg successfully pivoted Facebook’s operations once before from desktop to mobile devices shortly after taking the company public, a move that helped supercharge its advertising business and ensure its dominance for much of the next decade. But smartphones were already ubiquitous at that time; if anything Facebook was a bit late.\n\nNow, the company is trying to spearhead a new technology and hoping consumers will follow its lead.\n\nMeta has positioned the shift as a sort of existential imperative for the company. After Apple’s app tracking changes hurt Meta’s ability to target ads to its users, the company doesn’t want to rely on any outside hardware or app store in the future.\n\nA visitor to the 2022 Tokyo Game Show tests the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a big difference between looking at a computer or smartphone display and wearing a headset. While Lindlbauer can imagine using a headset for perhaps an hour a day, alternating between immersive views in VR and digital imagery that mixes with the physical world, “I think we haven’t hit the sweet spot yet of something I want to wear all day,” he said.\n\nMeta is also facing an enormous challenge when it comes to showing off VR content that users like the looks of and want to use repeatedly. According to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, internal documents show Horizon Worlds has fewer than 200,000 active monthly users, a rounding error for a company with 3.7 billion monthly active users across its various services. (A Meta spokesperson told the Journal that it’s “easy to be a cynic about the metaverse” but Meta thinks it is “the future of computing.”)\n\n“They’re starting with this idea that they want to build one big space like Horizon Worlds in which everybody’s just going to show up and start building stuff,” said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens VR headset. “There’s no virtual world that was ever successful building a canvas that people would just come and start painting.”\n\nZuckerberg has personally received intense criticism for the way Meta envisions work and play interactions in virtual spaces after posting on Facebook an image of his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Horizon Worlds — an image he later admitted was “pretty basic.”\n\n“As far as the quick-twitch, give-me-more public is concerned, the progress seen so far is a letdown,” said Janna Anderson, director of the Imagining the Internet Center at Elon University. “Meta is suffering tremendous ridicule in social media and in the overall public zeitgeist.”\n\nThe Quest Pro’s face-tracking capabilities can help make avatars’ facial expressions look more realistic: Initially, users can access this tracking in Horizon Worlds and Horizon Workrooms, Meta said, as well as in several developers’ apps such as Painting VR and DJ app Tribe XR.\n\nBut even with facial tracking, what users see when they pop in to Horizon Worlds — blocky, human-like avatars that exist only from the torso up, floating around a virtual plaza — will for now continue to contrast sharply with the image Zuckerberg portrayed during Meta’s Connect event on October 11 of his own full-body avatar.\n\nIn the meantime, investors appear to be getting fed up with the investments in the metaverse at a time when the future of its core business is also deeply uncertain.\n\n“I think kind of summing up how investors are feeling right now is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core,” Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said on Meta’s earnings call this week.\n\nZuckerberg, for his part, is defending the strategy shift. “I’d say that there’s a difference between something being experimental and not knowing how good it’s going to end up being,” he responded. Separately, he added: “I think people are going to look back decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz Clare Duffy", "Rachel Metz", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/us/robot-dogs-us-mexico-border-patrol-cec/index.html", "title": "Robot dogs could patrol the US-Mexico border | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe photos look like a scene out of science fiction: Robot dogs patrolling the US-Mexico border, climbing over harsh terrain to search for threats and contraband.\n\nBut these images are real.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security recently released them as it revealed details about how it’s testing the technology.\n\nOfficials praised the robots’ potential as a “force multiplier” that could boost Border Patrol agents’ safety by reducing their exposure to life-threatening hazards. An article touting the tests on the DHS Science and Technology Directorate’s website notes that someday the dogs, officially known as Automated Ground Surveillance Vehicles, could become “a CBP agent or officer’s best friend.”\n\n“Don’t be surprised,” it says, “if in the future we see robot ‘Fido’ out in the field, walking side-by-side with CBP personnel.”\n\nBut the details about the testing did seem to catch some people by surprise, sparking a flurry of reactions on social media comparing the images to dystopian scenes from sci-fi shows like “Black Mirror.”\n\n“This really felt like a slap in the face,” says Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, an umbrella group that slams the initiative as an “alarming and outrageous” waste of taxpayer money that would be better spent developing systems to hold Border Patrol agents accountable.\n\nGaubeca describes herself as a lover of technology and dogs (she has five). But she says she sees nothing cute in the government’s recent descriptions of robot dogs lending a “helping paw.” For years her organization has warned that militarization along the border puts communities and migrants at risk. And this, she says, is just the latest troubling example.\n\n“There are other technologies that they’re already using that we feel like they should cut back on, and yet they’re adding on another type of surveillance technology that’s frightening, to be honest,” Gaubeca says. “This certainly seems like it’s something that’s built for something very aggressive, like the theaters of war, rather than in a community.”\n\nGhost Robotics, the Philadelphia-based company that makes the robots DHS teams have been testing, says there’s nothing to be afraid of.\n\n“We’re focused on doing the right thing.

In the 1960s, the Jetsons’ futuristic cartoon family briefly adopted a nuclear-powered electronic dog, Lectronimo, before deciding to donate him to the police department.\n\nMenacing mechanical hounds hunted down fugitives in Ray Bradbury’s dystopian 1953 novel “Fahrenheit 451.” In 2017, an episode of “Black Mirror” featured terrifying robot guard dogs who chase and kill people.\n\nBut Parikh, Ghost Robotics’ CEO, says there’s a big gap between the way robot dogs are portrayed in science fiction – and sometimes skewered on social media – and the reality of the technology.\n\n“It’s a battery-operated computer that moves around on four legs that literally stops operating in four hours. There’s no way they’re going to be taking over anything,” he says.\n\nAnd, he notes, “it’s a robot that’s remotely controlled by a human in the middle.”\n\nThis handout image shows Ghost Robotics' Vision 60 robot dog along the US-Mexico border. Ghost Robotics/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut still, Parikh says his company’s robots do provide a number of advantages in border zones. US Customs and Border Protection is patrolling a huge geographic area, he notes, often under harsh conditions.\n\n“This is a good way of technology adding value,” he says, “filling in the holes.”\n\nDuring testing of the 100-pound robots, different types of cameras and sensors were mounted on them, transmitting real-time data to humans operating them via laptop or hand-held remote, DHS said.\n\nTeams first tested them on asphalt, grass and hills in Lorton, Virginia, then tested them in more realistic scenarios in El Paso, Texas, where they walked up hills, down ravines and over rocks. The El Paso testing simulated sentry duty and inspections. And exercises also included maneuvers in tight spaces, high heat and low-oxygen conditions, “situations that are especially dangerous for CBP agents and officers,” DHS said.\n\nDHS Science & Technology program manager Brenda Long describes the dogs as a “great fit,” given CBP’s broad mission and the many risks its personnel face.\n\n“The southern border can be an inhospitable place for man and beast, and that is exactly why a machine may excel there,” she said in the department’s press release.\n\nAdvocates at the border say they already felt under siege\n\nCommunity advocates at the border have long accused the US government of militarizing the region and using excessive surveillance. And the announcement of the robot dog testing doesn’t help matters, Gaubeca says\n\n“Border communities already feel over-surveilled, over-militarized, and yet they trot out this new technology and boast about it at a time when families are worried about how to get food on their tables and inflation,” she says. “And it completely disregards the border communities as a community. It’s like they fail to acknowledge that we’re human beings on both sides.”\n\nFor Gaubeca, it boils down to how resources are allocated.\n\n“It’s a use of technology that creates more problems and doesn’t solve what we see as being the issue, which is how do we make this agency accountable, and how do we create a more humanitarian and efficient system at the border?” she says. “They should spend the money on something that is more humanitarian and effective, rather than intimidating.”\n\nThe Biden administration has said it wants to create a more efficient, humane, orderly system at the border, but “this completely contradicts that sentiment,” she says.\n\nGhost Robotics has partnered with the US Defense Department in the past. And Parikh noted he’d just gotten off the phone with Ukraine’s defense ministry before speaking with CNN this week. But he said the robot dogs on the US border aren’t part of a military effort – and any suggestion that they are is silly.\n\nThis image released by the US Air Force in 2020 shows US Air Force Staff Sgt Carmen Pontello introducing Hammer, a working dog, to the Ghost Robotics Vision 60 at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

It’s not really interacting with people. That’s not what it’s made for. There’s no weapons on it,” he says. “It’s not being militarized for the border. It’s not stopping people, saying ‘don’t go here.’ It can’t do that. It’s a small robot.”\n\nThe technology, he says, is designed to keep people safe. But could it ever be used against migrants at the border?\n\n“That’s not even come up ever,” Parikh says. “It’s not even a remote use case that’s ever discussed or talked about.”\n\nPeople can’t even agree about “a basic physical wall that’s made of concrete and metal,” he says.\n\n“Do we really think we’re going to start weaponizing robots? It’s silly to do that. I don’t think that’s in the DNA of America either,” Parikh says. “We live in a country that has so many rules and regulatory requirements in place that things like this are just remote and virtually impossible without the say of the populace.”\n\nParikh says Ghost Robotics regularly works with legislators as well as government agencies.\n\n“This is not done in a vacuum …. It has to go through processes and rules. Everything we do, everything, gets questioned. Everyone has the ability to question what we’re doing.”\n\nThis isn’t just about the border\n\nWhen Greg Nojeim heard about the robot dogs, his mind filled with questions. Chief among them: Has anyone studied their impact on privacy?\n\n“The border has become a testing ground for new and intrusive surveillance technology,” says Nojeim, co-director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nAnd in many cases, he says, the law hasn’t caught up with the developing technology.\n\n“Once the platform becomes accepted, believe me, new uses will be developed. It’s inevitable. And I don’t think we’re ready as a society to say, this use is permissible, this is not. I don’t think that legislatures are ready to say this is permissible, this use is not. … I’m concerned that the technology is getting ahead of the law.”\n\nA robot dog scans a desert landscape with its camera and sensor while on sentry duty in this handout photo provided by the Department of Homeland Security. DHS\n\nHe says when that happens, civil liberties suffer. And that, he says, should matter to everyone, whether you live near the border or not.\n\nAs a recent Los Angeles Times opinion column noted, surveillance technologies that start out at the border often make their way into other parts of the country.\n\nFacial recognition technology is one recent example, Nojeim says.\n\n“That technology has now spread to some police departments, and people are finding that it doesn’t identify people as well as it could, and that people of color are being misidentified at alarming rates,” he says.\n\nIf robot dogs start patrolling the border, Nojeim says, it’s only a matter of time before they could show up in your community, too.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

The litigation deals with issues of intellectual property, copyright infringement and fair use in a rapidly changing new-media landscape.\n\nFor decades, so-called “copycat” lawsuits boiled down to ‘you stole my song/book/idea.’ Now, as the number of platforms to showcase artistic content have multiplied, these court cases are testing the rights of fans, creators and rivals to reinterpret other people’s intellectual property.\n\nAt issue, particularly in social media or new technology, is exactly how much you have to transform something to profit and get credit for it, literally, to make it your business.\n\nThree weeks ago, in a first-of-its-kind case, a jury in an Illinois federal court ruled that tattoo artist Catherine Alexander’s copyright was violated when the likeness of her client, World Wrestling Entertainment star Randy Orton, was depicted in a video game. Alexander has tattooed Orton’s arms from his shoulders to his wrists.\n\nShe won, but not much: $3,750, because the court ruled that, though her copyright had been violated, her tattoos didn’t impact game profits. Nonetheless, it set a precedent.\n\nThe ruling calls into question the abilities of people with tattoos “to control the right to make or license realistic depictions of their own likenesses,” said Aaron J. Moss, a Hollywood litigation attorney specializing in copyright matters.\n\nBlame the rise of remix culture. For most of the twentieth century, mass content was created and distributed by professionals,” said Moss. “Individuals were consumers. Legal issues were pretty straightforward. But, now, most of the time, the content is being repurposed, remixed or repackaged.”\n\n“It’s all new and it’s all a mess,” said Victor Wiener, a fine-art appraiser who’s consulted for Lloyd’s of London and serves as an expert witness in art-valuation court cases. Over the past several decades, the distinctions between professionals and amateurs, artists and copycats and between production and consumption have blurred. In such gray areas, said Wiener, “it can come down to who the judge, or the tryer of fact, believes.”\n\nStreaming service Netflix late last month settled a copyright lawsuit against fans of their Regency romance “Bridgerton” who wrote and workshopped an “Unofficial Bridgerton Musical” on TikTok.\n\nIn January 2021, a month after the Netflix show premiered, singer Abigail Barlow teamed up with musician Emily Bear to create their own interpretation of the hit series. In a souped-up version of fan fiction, the two women began to write and to perform songs they had written, often using exact dialogue from the series.\n\nIt was a huge hit on TikTok, in part because the duo invited feedback and participation, making it a crowd-sourced artwork.\n\nAt first Netflix applauded the effort and even okayed the recording of an album of songs. But when the creators took their show on the road and sold tickets, Netflix sued.\n\nProducer and series creator Shondra Rhimes, in a statement released when the suit was filed in July, said “what started as a fun celebration by [fans] on social media has turned into the blatant taking of intellectual property.”\n\nCases like this turn on “fair use,” matters such as how much of another work someone appropriates. Or whether it dents the original creator’s ability to profit. In the case of “Bridgerton,” neither side has commented on the resolution of the suit, but a planned performance of the musical at Royal Albert Hall scheduled for last month was cancelled.\n\nUncontrolled misappropriation is particularly common in the relatively new NFT art field.\n\n“Today, a 15-year-old can copy your work and spread it across the Internet like feral cat pee at no cost and with little effort. The intellectual capital of an artist can be appropriated on a massive, global scale unimaginable by the people who wrote copyright laws,” said John Wolpert, co-founder of the IBM blockchain and of several blockchain projects.\n\nAnd the relatively new phenomenon of trading art NFTs with cryptocurrency “has created a perverse new incentive to misappropriate an artist’s work and to claim it as your own and charge people to purchase it,” he added.\n\nIn one of several NFT suits finding their way to the courts, fashion giant Hermes sued L.A. artist Mason Rothschild after he created 100 NFT’s that depicted Hermes Birkin bags wrapped in fake fur.\n\nHermes filed a lawsuit in January in the court of the Southern District in New York charging trademark infringement and injury to business reputation, not to mention “rip off,” with Hermes requesting a quick summary judgment.\n\nBut in the past, courts have often bent over backward to give an artist leeway in critique and parody. Rebecca Tushnet, a Harvard Law professor and expert on copyright and trademark law who represents the artist, has argued his “MetaBirkins” art project is essentially protected as it comments on the relationship between consumerism and the value of art.\n\nLast month, the Central District court of California ruled on a doozy of a copyright lawsuit that arose via Instagram: Carlos Vila v. Deadly Doll.\n\nIn 2020, the photographer had taken an image of model Irina Shayk. She was wearing sweatpants from fashion company Deadly Doll that featured a large illustration of a woman carrying a skull. The photographer subsequently licensed his image of the model for reproduction. Deadly Doll posted Vila’s photo on their Instagram account and he sued. They counter-sued, arguing he was the infringer. The suit, detailed by litigator Moss in his Copyright Lately blog, is moving forward in California.\n\nPerhaps the most important case has nothing to do with new media – it concerns Andy Warhol’s altered photograph of the late artist Prince that ran in Vanity Fair magazine years ago. But it is expected to set a precedent.\n\nRight now, the US Supreme Court is hearing this landmark case regarding Warhol’s alleged misappropriation of photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s work in his silkscreens of Prince. The court is set to determine how, and how much, an artist or creator must transform a work to make it their own – guidelines that will surely create as much of a buzz as the intellectual property itself.", "authors": ["Alexandra Peers", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/tech/us-chip-manufacturing-semiconductors/index.html", "title": "The US is spending billions to boost chip manufacturing. Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}]}

In her brief speech, she refused the Oscar for best actor on behalf of Marlon Brando, faced a mixture of loud boos and cheers, and defended the rights of Native Americans on national TV.\n\nAlmost 50 years later, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is formally apologizing to Littlefeather for the mistreatment she experienced during her speech and in the years to follow.\n\n“The abuse you endured because of this statement was unwarranted and unjustified,” former Academy president David Rubin wrote in a letter to Littlefeather. “The emotional burden you have lived through and the cost to your own career in our industry are irreparable. For too long the courage you showed has been unacknowledged. For this, we offer both our deepest apologies and our sincere admiration.”\n\nLittlefeather will appear at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures next month to discuss her history-making Oscars appearance and the future of Indigenous representation onscreen, the Academy said.\n\nLittlefeather (seated center), pictured in 2019, called the event in her honor a \"dream come true.\" Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n\nIn a statement, Littlefeather called the upcoming event, during which she’ll receive the apology in person, “a dream come true.”\n\n“Regarding the Academy’s apology to me, we Indians are very patient people – it’s only been 50 years!” she said. “We need to keep our sense of humor about this at all times. It’s our method of survival.”\n\nSeveral Indigenous artists will perform during the event for Littlefeather, including Bird Runningwater, co-chair of the Academy’s Indigenous Alliance, and Virginia Carmelo, a descendent of the Tongva people who will lead a land acknowledgment.\n\n“It is profoundly heartening to see how much has changed since I did not accept the Academy Award 50 years ago,” Littlefeather said.\n\nHer speech earned boos and applause\n\nWhen Brando won best actor for his starring role in “The Godfather,” he was absent. In his stead, he asked Littlefeather, then an actress and activist, to attend the ceremony – and to refuse the award on his behalf.\n\nTaking the stage quietly and calmly in a buckskin dress, Littlefeather solemnly introduced herself as an Apache woman and president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee.\n\n“(Brando) very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award, and the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,” she said to a mix of boos and applause, pausing and appearing visibly upset. “I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening, and that we will, in the future, our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and generosity.”\n\nLittlefeather said she promised Brando she wouldn't touch the award itself.

The meeting, initially scheduled for April 18, was expedited after Smith announced his resignation from the Academy last week.\n\nSmith issued a quick, concise statement on his ban from the Oscars for the next decade.\n\n“I accept and respect the Academy’s decision,” the actor said in a statement to CNN.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rock’s representatives for comment.﻿\n\nThe decision came following “tons of debate” on what the consequences of his on-stage slap should be, a board member tells CNN.\n\nThe Academy’s letter added: “The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage.”\n\n“During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,” the letter went on to state. “For this, we are sorry.

After all but sweeping the season, Cate Blanchett is expected to pick up best actress for her career-defining performance in \"Tár,\" although look out for the beloved Michelle Yeoh (\"Everything Everywhere\") as a strong potential spoiler.\n\nDespite recent setbacks at the British Academy Film Awards, where they lost to stars of \"Banshees,\" Angela Bassett (\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\") and Ke Huy Quan (\"Everything Everywhere\") are still favored to win SAG's best supporting actress and best supporting actor prizes, respectively. Best actor is a three-way race between Colin Farrell (\"Banshees\"), Brendan Fraser (\"The Whale\") and Austin Butler (\"Elvis\"), although the latter has the edge after his BAFTA and Golden Globes victories.\n\nWho else will be honored?\n\nAndrew Garfield will present the SAG life achievement award to his \"Amazing Spider-Man\" co-star Sally Field, a two-time Oscar-winning actress best known for roles in \"Lincoln,\" \"Norma Rae,\" \"Places in the Heart\" and \"Forrest Gump.\" SAG's previous life achievement honorees include Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Carol Burnett. The award recognizes career achievement and humanitarian accomplishment.\n\nHow are SAG Awards decided?\n\nThe SAG Awards celebrate movies and TV and are voted on by 122,600 eligible voters within the actors' union SAG-AFTRA. Because the trophies are entirely voted on by actors – who also make up the largest branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences – the SAG Awards are often a reliable bellwether for future Oscars glory. Films such as \"CODA,\" \"Parasite\" and \"Spotlight\" all won the best cast prize at SAG before taking home Academy Awards for best picture. The best actor and best actress Oscar winners have also both lined up with SAG for eight of the past 10 years.\n\nOn top of all that, the SAG Awards are one of the last major opportunities for this year's nominees to give a speech before Oscar voting opens March 2.

Most have done it since the June 2015 slayings of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The man later convicted in the killings was an avowed white supremacist who had posed for photos holding the Confederate battle flag.\n\nSouth Carolina removed a Confederate battle flag from the statehouse lawn soon after the slayings. New Orleans recently started taking down Confederate statues.\n\nThe Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus chairwoman, Democratic Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes of Gulfport, said Tuesday that the boycott is designed to put pressure on state House Speaker Philip Gunn. Soon after the Charleston shootings, Republican Gunn, who is white, said his Christian faith led him to see the Confederate symbol as “a point of offense that needs to be removed” from the Mississippi flag. But, he has not rounded up the votes to make a change.\n\nGunn is chairman of the Southern Legislative Conference, with members from 15 states. The group holds its annual meeting July 29-Aug. 2 in Biloxi. Gunn said in a statement Tuesday that SLC “is a well-respected organization” and the meeting will “showcase the positives of Mississippi.”\n\n“It brings a great amount of economic benefit to the state, attracting nearly 1,000 people,” Gunn said. “This event is a good opportunity to stand with me, someone who has not wavered in my support of changing the flag, to promote all that is good about our great state.”\n\nCritics say the Confederate symbol is a divisive reminder of slavery and segregation in a state with a 38 percent black population, but supporters say it represents history that should not be forgotten.\n\nMississippi has used the same flag since 1894, and voters chose to keep it in a 2001 election.\n\nWilliams-Barnes told The Associated Press that the Black Caucus has not united around a new design proposal.\n\n“What we’re really wanting is a flag that charts a different future for our state, that charts a different future for our children and that is about a vision that unites people in the state with each other as well as unites Mississippi with other states in the nation,” she said.\n\nThe executive director of the Council of State Governments’ Southern Legislative Conference, based in Atlanta, was traveling and did not immediately return a message.\n\nDuring the legislative session that ended in March, several bills proposed redesigning the flag and some others proposed financial punishment for universities that have stopped flying it. All died because Gunn and other leaders said there was no consensus among lawmakers to either reject or protect the flag.\n\nFifty-one of Mississippi’s 174 state lawmakers are black, and 50 of them are in the Black Caucus. Williams-Barnes said a majority of caucus members voted to boycott the regional conference, and about 80 percent are planning to take part in the boycott.

The act was created in 2013, decades after the state permitted counties to use seals.\n\nHe said the seal should not be interpreted as a dedication to a conflict, like the Battle of Franklin. It instead is artwork that, taken together, represent the history of the county \"as an entity.\"\n\nH. Edward Phillips, an attorney for the SVC, argued the seal is in fact artwork and thus the act would apply.\n\nHe also said the quadrants of the seal, including the upper left-hand one with the Confederate flag, are representative of the county's history, including its Civil War history, much of which is preserved today.\n\nThe seal was adopted in 1968, the same year as Martin Luther King's assassination and the height of the Civil Rights movement. But it was also the centennial of the Civil War's end and a time when several southern states used the Confederate flag to show resistance to the Civil Rights movement.\n\nWhat's next for the seal\n\nMosely told the Historical Commission the county does not yet have a plan for how to alter the seal. But the next decision would be up to members of the Williamson County Commission.\n\nThe SCV will have the opportunity to appeal the decision once the declaratory order is signed. If this happens and the Historical Commission denies the appeal, the original petition for waiver will be dismissed by the presiding judge.\n\nTalks on this issue began in the summer of 2020 when Franklin resident Dustin Koctar created a petition urging the removal of the Confederate flag from the seal. The petition, as of now, has garnered just under 12,000 signatures.\n\nA task force aimed at studying the seal was formed and approved in July 2020. The group ultimately recommended the removal to county commissioners, resulting in the commission's 16-7 vote to remove the symbol.\n\nEducation:Lipscomb launches new program to turn Antioch students into future Metro Schools teachers\n\nMore:Garth Brooks’ new Lower Broadway bar and retail store, Friends In Low Places\n\nThe first hearing before the state commission under the Heritage Protection Act took place in February 2021. However, the final hearing has been delayed twice, mainly due to formal intervention on the case from a Spring Hill-based chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans and the county's attempt to settle with the party.\n\nKoctar, who attended the Friday hearing, said he was \"pleased\" with the historical commission's decision.\n\n\"I know members of the community look forward to working with Williamson County and the Board of Commissioners to provide feedback and recommendations on what can be done with our county seal to show that we are community that is welcoming, compassionate, inclusive and safe for everyone,\" he said in a statement to the Tennessean.\n\n\"I also hope this encourages members of our community to continue to stand up for what is right, to listen to our neighbors who are hurting, and speak out against racism and injustice.\"\n\nAnika Exum is a reporter covering Williamson County at The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network — Tennessee.

Three-quarters of all city flags surveyed scored below 5. On average, cities scored 4.3.\n\nScottsdale received an abysmal 2.8 score, ranking 128th overall. By a large margin, Scottsdale lost out to Phoenix, which was one of the clear favorites with an 8.65 score, ranking fourth. Glendale ranked 102nd.\n\nScottsdale, however, did beat Mesa, which ranked 146th, with one survey participant mocking its striking resemblance to a gas-station logo.\n\n\"Hey look! Gas is 3 cents less than in Provo! Great People, Quality Service? What the heck is that all about? Is that supposed to stir civic pride in Mesa?\" the participant wrote.\n\nGalvanized by its place in the bottom five, the Mesa City Council voted unanimously to redesign the city flag in 2005.\n\nScottsdale is following suit more than a decade later, and it all started with 15-year-old Connor Heron.\n\nTeen calls for change\n\nThe Desert Mountain High School sophomore will be the first to admit it: Until recently, he had no idea what the Scottsdale flag looked like. In fact, he wasn’t aware his home city even had one.\n\nWhen he finally saw it, he wasn’t impressed.\n\n\"My immediate response was just, 'Oh.' \" Heron said.\n\nIn a brutally honest note to Mayor Jim Lane and council members, Heron described the flag as \"pitiful\" and \"horribly uncreative.\"\n\n\"Beating 22 other flags is nothing to be proud of,\" he wrote, citing the 2004 survey.\n\n“Our flag is in dire need of changing,” he pleaded in a June email, pitching the idea for public design challenge.\n\n\"I believe that a new flag for the city will improve the city's image and how it portrays itself to other cities,\" Heron told The Arizona Republic.\n\nCity leaders agreed. In June, Lane asked for a motion for staff to initiate the project. Councilman David Smith obliged, and the council unanimously it.\n\nThe city had received nearly 50 designs with one week left in the challenge, said Rachel Smetana, Lane's chief of staff.\n\nCivic engagement has been a high priority in the search for the new look, she said. It comes at a time when Lane says he has \"never seen the city more torn apart\" than over the proposed center Desert EDGE.\n\n\"We are excited about the community engagement. We’ve had social-media comments saying, 'This should have been done years ago,' \" Smetana said.\n\nSome opt for tradition\n\nBut, of course, design \"rules\" are simply guidelines. Principled designs are sometimes not welcomed and don't always prevail.\n\nSome residents have complained to the City Council that the flag should be left alone, while others wonder if the task is better left to design professionals instead of the public.\n\n\"Who said you could change the City Flag design????\" a resident wrote to the council, noting that the cowboy emblem is familiar and the flag has been around for decades.\n\nIman Ismail, the owner of Flag World & Sports in Old Town, backed the idea of keeping the city's cowboy emblem on the flag.\n\n\"I think it's neat,\" she said. “Make it a desert color. But stick with the original Scottsdale logo.”\n\nAlthough a fan of the current flag, Ismail admits to Googling the flag before making her critique.\n\n\"I couldn't remember what it looked like,\" she said.\n\nIsmail has owned the flag store for eight years and one in downtown Phoenix for 26 years. Neither store carries the Scottsdale flag because not once has a customer tried purchase one, she said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, local residents and tourists don't ask for it,\" Ismail said, adding that she makes special orders for the city when replacements are needed.\n\n\"City of Phoenix's, though ... people like that one,\" she said, saying that both stores have Phoenix flags in stock.\n\nSo if residents pay little attention to the Scottsdale flag, why does the design matter?\n\nWhy a good flag matters\n\nAccording to vexillological expert Ted Kaye's book \"Good Flag, Bad Flag,\" there is a positive feedback loop between great symbolism and civic pride.\n\nA poorly designed flag doesn't get flown and then becomes unknown to most people, Kaye wrote.\n\nJust as national flags bring countries together, city flags can have the same power, Kaye said. When designed well, a flag can communicate the city's identity and unify residents to come together to solve larger issues.\n\nExperience Scottsdale spokeswoman Rachel Pearson said the city's flag is not familiar to most of its visitors from across the country and around the world.\n\n\"We look forward to seeing a new flag that represents the best of Scottsdale and the character we are known for, especially as a world-class destination,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd also love to see something that citizens can be proud of flying in the wind,\" Heron said. When the wind isn't blowing, the current design looks like a \"plain white bed sheet,\" he said.\n\nFor Heron, having public input on the design is important because it's about residents and their values.\n\n\"The members of the community that the flag will be flown over should have a say in its design,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nGrain-free breads a hit for Scottsdale-based Mikey’s\n\nPhoenix Open plans new suites amid rising impact\n\nWhat to know about Scottsdale's Desert EDGE\n\nGreat Hearts pulls out of controversial park plan\n\nJaguar mix from Vegas has 2nd act near Scottsdale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/09/06/burlington-holds-contest-new-city-flag/636828001/", "title": "Burlington holds contest for new city flag", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nBurlington is asking residents to submit designs for a new city flag.\n\nThe design should capture the \"spirit and character\" of the Burlington community, according to submission guidelines posted by Burlington City Arts.\n\nMayor Miro Weinberger said in a statement that the new flag would be used at municipal buildings and special events.\n\nSee also:Board imposes conditions on Burlington teachers\n\nOnly Burlington residents and business owners are eligible for the contest, and designs must be submitted online at burlingtoncityarts.org/btvflag before October 15.

Indigenous people, advocates, and lawmakers took to the steps of the capitol to urge the Legislature to consider three bills that would replace the state flag and motto, ban Native American mascots, and refine laws around repatriation and disposition of Native American human remains.\n\nUnited American Indians of New England and the North American Indian Center of Boston helped organize Thursday's event where Sens. Jo Comerford, D-Northampton, and Jason Lewis, D-Winchester, and Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa, D-Northampton, paid tribute to the state's Native American tribes and supported the bills.\n\nLewis said Senate Democrats planned at a midday caucus to discuss bills \"to replace the seal and flag and to prohibit [Native American] images and mascots in our high schools.\"\n\n\"It is now on the agenda for the state Senate,\" he said in front of the State House.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker weighed in on the idea during a Thursday press conference inside the State House.\n\n\"There's a conversation that's going on in states and municipalities and in some cases, at the national level, about many symbols and historical emblems and if people here in Massachusetts want to pursue discussions with respect to some of those, we'd be open to talking to them about it,\" he said. \"Obviously, it's the sort of thing that would have to be done in conjunction with our colleagues in the Legislature as well but we'd be open to those conversations.\"\n\nAmong the trio of bills is a piece of legislation (S 1877 / H 2776) sponsored by Lewis that would establish a commission to recommend a revised state seal and motto by Dec. 2 in an attempt to remove features that could be conceived as harmful or misunderstood by state residents.\n\nMembers would include the executive director of Indian affairs, five members appointed by the Commission on Indian Affairs who are of lineal descent from tribes, the state secretary, and executive director of Massachusetts Historical Commission, among others.\n\nComerford described the current images on the state flag as depicting a Native American \"not even based on tribes that have a historic presence in our commonwealth.\" State law calls for a seal to include \"a blue shield with an Indian thereon, dressed in a shirt, leggings and moccasins, holding in his right hand a bow, and in his left an arrow, pointed downward, all of gold.\"\n\nAnother bill (S 247 / H 443) sponsored by Comerford would direct the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to create regulations barring public schools from using an athletics team name, logo, or mascot that refers to or represents Native Americans.\n\n\"What does that image say to our Native students, or Native residents, and everybody in the Commonwealth?\" Comerford said. \"It perpetuates racist stereotypes and white supremacy.\"\n\nLakota Sioux Stefanie Salguero's mother went looking to find her biological family after she was adopted by white people in 1967. She found her father who was a full Lakota Sioux Native American but realized he knew nothing about his culture.\n\n\"That is colonization. Even when she found her father, who was a Native American, he knew nothing, nothing to pass down to me. Nothing I can pass down to my children,\" she said in front of the State House. \"This is the success of colonization and the reason why we have to fight back. We cannot let this keep happening for generations to come.\"\n\nSabadosa started to speak as a pro-police rally made its way across Beacon Street and onto the State House steps. A third group protesting an eviction moratorium extension came from Bowdoin Street toward the front of the State House. For a moment, Sabadosa paused her speech as the three groups intertwined.\n\nAfter some of the chants died down, Sabadosa said people across the state have reached out to her asking why the commonwealth still has a \"racist flag.\"\n\n\"They have shown us pictures and drawings of what they envision as what the future of Massachusetts should be. And it should be inclusive,\" she said. \"It should be a future that represents the values that we purport to support, or at least some of us do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/22/ms-flag-commission-move-quickly-choosing-new-design/5487065002/", "title": "MS flag: Commission to move quickly on choosing new design", "text": "Mississippi's flag commission agreed on a process for selecting a new state banner at its first meeting Wednesday, despite still lacking three members to be appointed by Gov.

The commission plans to keep the submission process open until Aug. 1.\n\nThe commission will review the designs and whittle them down over the coming weeks — and perhaps add a few designs of their own. Eventually, the public will comment on five finalists. Commission members agreed to make a final selection by Sept. 2. Voters must approve that design in November, and a new state flag could fly as soon as early 2021.\n\n\"I want you to understand the weight of what you're about to do,\" House Speaker Philip Gunn told the commissioners as their first meeting began Wednesday. \"This last flag that we had existed for 126 years or so. And what we are about to set the course on is going to last beyond the lifetimes of any of us. People are going to look at this new flag for years to come.\"\n\nFlag retired after pressure from outside groups\n\nLed by Gunn, lawmakers last month removed the former flag and its Confederate battle emblem after a flurry of debate and pressure from outside groups. Their legislation, signed into law by Reeves, created the commission and set a basic outline of how to choose a new flag. Any new design must include the words \"In God We Trust.\"\n\nSix commission members — appointed by Gunn and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann — met Wednesday at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, with two joining remotely. They unanimously chose Reuben Anderson, the first Black justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court from 1985 to 1991, to serve as chairman. Anderson also is president of the Department of Archives and History's board of trustees.\n\nThe names:Six commission members selected to design new Mississippi flag\n\nGov. Reeves yet to make appointments to commission\n\nReeves still has not made his three appointments to the commission, despite a recent deadline to do so contained in the legislation. Reeves last week said he has been too busy, though he is expected to pick them this week. He must choose one person each from the Mississippi Economic Council, the Mississippi Arts Commission and the board of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.\n\nEven if Reeves delays the appointments further, however, the commission has a quorum and appears ready to continue conducting work.\n\nAnderson said he felt \"uniquely qualified\" to serve as leader of the commission. He recalled attending law school at Ole Miss in the 1960s, when it seemed everyone on campus carried the state flag with its Confederate emblem and the marching band wore Confederate uniforms. \"So I was not welcome,\" he said.\n\nAnderson also reflected on his more than 50 years as a lawyer and judge in Mississippi, where \"every courtroom I walked into, that flag told me I was not welcome.\"\n\n\"That former state flag has caused so much grief in our state, for so long,\" he told the other commissioners. \"We're the right group to take care of it.\"\n\nMore:Have an idea for Mississippi's new state flag? Here's how to submit it for consideration\n\nCommission to begin weeding out ineligible entries from public soon\n\nThe commissioners and MDAH staff plan to sort through the existing submissions in the coming days. They likely will weed out many that do not meet criteria including the \"In God We Trust\" language, or other basic flag design, or vexillology, standards. The commission plans to meet with a vexillology expert on Tuesday, with additional meetings to select a final design set for Aug. 19 and Sept. 2.\n\nThe deadline for the commission to report its flag design recommendation to the governor and the Legislature is Sept. 14. But officials said Wednesday they hope to speed up that process to ensure election officials have enough time to print the flag question on Nov. 3 ballots.\n\nGunn said the legislative process that led to the commission's Wednesday meeting was \"nothing short of a miracle.\" Three weeks before the flag change bill passed, \"nobody had this on the radar screen,\" he said. Then legislators began to approach Gunn, he said, saying they were ready to support a change after their children or grandchildren had lobbied them.\n\n\"You are making history,\" Gunn told the commission. \"Whatever design you come up with is going to represent this state probably forever. I hope you feel the weight of that.\"\n\nThose interested in submitting a design can still do so until Aug. 1. MDAH has the criteria on its website.

It was adopted in 1894 and has survived challenges before.\n\nIf Mississippi decided to change its flag, what would a new one look like? Here are some alternatives that have been proposed over years.\n\nThe Magnolia Flag\n\nThe Magnolia Flag was Mississippi's first official state flag when it joined the Confederacy in 1861. A committee came up with the flag which prominently featured the state tree.\n\nThe Magnolia Flag was replaced in 1894 with Mississippi's current flag.\n\nThe upper left corner of the Magnolia Flag featured the Bonnie Blue Flag, which was Mississippi's flag when Mississippi was briefly the Republic of West Florida.\n\nMore:Mississippi flag: Where do governor, lieutenant governor stand on Confederate emblem?\n\nThe Bonnie Blue Flag\n\nAfter a rebellion against Spain in 1810, the area that now includes Mississippi was briefly the Republic of West Florida under the Bonnie Blue Flag, with one white star, until being annexed by the U.S.\n\nFrom statehood in 1817 to the start of the Civil War in 1861, Mississippi had no state flag.\n\nAccording to Mississippi historian, author and professor David Sansing, the night after the Secession Convention at the Old Capitol, people walked through Jackson streets waving the Bonnie Blue.\n\nProposition B\n\nIn 2001, voters were asked to whether they wanted to keep the state flag. The controversial referendum asked voters to choose between Proposition A (the current flag) and Proposition B.\n\nProposition B was mostly the same flag, but replaced Confederate battle flag with 20 white stars in a circular pattern set against a blue background. Mississippi was the nation's 20th state.\n\nThe referendum failed. More than 60 percent of voters stuck with the current flag.\n\nThe Stennis Flag\n\nIn 2016, Rep. Kathy Sykes, D-Jackson, filed a bill that would change the state flag to one designed by Laurin Stennis, the granddaughter of the late Sen. John Stennis.\n\nThe so-called Stennis Flag was not adopted, but the campaign to make it Mississippi's state flag is not over. The flag is seen on bumper stickers, front porches and business across the state.\n\nAccording to its website, the Stennis flag features 19 blue stars in a circle around a 20th star, denoting that Mississippi was the 20th state to join the nation. The flag — with a white background and blue stars — is also an inversion of the Bonnie Blue Flag. It also has red bars on its sides.\n\nContact Giacomo \"Jack\" Bologna at 601-961-7282 or gbologna@gannett.com.

Confederate flag from seal", "text": "Franklin resident Dustin Koctar believes Williamson County should rethink its official seal, which depicts a Confederate flag, along with an image of a schoolhouse, a bible in front of a church window and farm animals.\n\nAccording to the county website, a description of the seal says the flag and cannons symbolize \"the rich history in the county,\" while the schoolhouse illustrates the importance of education, the bible represents religion and the farm animals denote agriculture.\n\nOn Monday, Koctar spoke before the Franklin Special School District Board of Education, presenting a proposal that would redesign the county seal without the Confederate flag and calling for collaboration between FSSD, Williamson County Schools, the County Commission, Mayor Anderson and the state.\n\nAt a vigil in Franklin on June 2, Koctar spoke before the crowd to honor George Floyd, a black man who was killed while in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department, after officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes.\n\n“All lives do not matter when a Confederate monument is in a place of prominence in our city, and the Confederate flag is on our county seal,” Koctar said.\n\nHis comment drew cheers from the crowd.\n\n\"With the response those words drew, I realized I wasn’t the only one who felt strongly about that, and I understood if we are going to challenge something like this, we have to come up with a solution,\" Koctar said.\n\nMore:Hundreds turn out for Franklin prayer vigil in honor of George Floyd\n\nBy Monday, Koctar devised a proposal that would address, he explained, a symbol of racial inequity on the county seal, which was created in 1968.\n\nKoctar said he thought the best plan could also involve students.\n\nDifficult conversations about racism\n\nThe recent killings of black citizens, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Floyd, and subsequent vigils, rallies and marches around the nation and world have forced Americans to have difficult conversations about racism, Koctar told the FSSD school board at the in-person meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Many people have been having those conversations for years, even decades, and it is encouraging to see more and more people speaking up and calling for action and accountability,\" Koctar said.\n\n\"With this knowledge, people are also identifying and challenging racist systems, policies and symbols, which is why I am here tonight.\"\n\nKoctar acknowledged that public displays of the Confederate battle flag have long been controversial.\n\nHe noted that the county adopted the seal as the civil rights movement was happening.\n\n\"The Williamson County seal has featured this flag in the top left corner since 1968, coincidentally the same year as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and shortly after the integration of the schools in our county,\" he said.\n\nSymbols of racial inequality come down\n\nThere has been a movement around the nation in cities and among institutions to discuss the removal of historical objects that depict slavery or suggest racial inequality.\n\nSome monuments have been torn down across the nation.\n\nOn June 5, the U.S. Marine Corps issued new rules to ban the public display of the Confederate battle flag at Marine installations and inside Marine office buildings.\n\n\"So if this flag is inappropriate for the U.S. Marines, it should no longer have a place on our county seal,\" Koctar said.\n\nAbout the proposal\n\nKoctar's proposal includes giving FSSD and WCS students the opportunity to create the new county seal, which would be approved by school administrators and the county commission.\n\n\"Now is the time for Williamson County to do the same thing to show a lasting change,\" said Koctar, who has three children attending a school in FSSD. \"And what better way than to highlight the talents, creativity and courage of our students.\"\n\nWhat are the legalities to changing the seal?\n\nCounty Commissioner Jennifer Mason asked county attorney Jeff Moseley about the legal stipulations of changing the seal at the Williamson County Commission meeting on Monday.\n\nSeveral citizens have sent letters asking the commission to consider removing the Confederate flag from the seal.\n\nAccording to Moseley, the Tennessee Historical Commission holds the authority to allow Williamson County to alter its seal under state law.\n\n\"Any memorial including artwork that commemorates a historic conflict like the Civil War cannot be altered unless its by the Tennessee Historical Commission,\" he said.\n\n\"Neither the mayor nor commission has the power to alter the seal.\"\n\nAlthough the county commission does not have the authority to change the seal, it does have the authority to vote on a resolution requesting that the state commission change the seal.\n\nSuch as resolution would require a two-thirds vote to pass.\n\nThe seal, designed by county historian Virginia Bowman and journalist James H. Armistead, was accepted by Judge Fulton Greer at the July 15, 1968 Quarterly Court Term, according to county records.\n\nThe next step Koctar said is to discuss the proposal with the county commission and WCS leadership.\n\nKerri Bartlett covers issues affecting children, families, education and government in Williamson County.

Deal initially said he wouldn't urge changes.\n\nPublic display of the Confederate flag has come under fire in the week since nine African Americans were killed attending Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. The accused shooter, Dylann Roof, 21, is linked to a manifesto that professes white supremacy.\n\nThe design on Georgia's license plate from the Sons of Confederate Veterans features the group's logo prominently up front as the Confederate battle flag covers the background. It also has the words \"Sons of Confederate Veterans\" where the county name is usually placed on the plates.\n\nDeal issued a statement Tuesday saying: \"Georgia has faced down this controversy before, has found solutions that brought people together instead of dividing them and has come through those debates a more united people. I know we can do that again. Georgia celebrates its diversity, its commitment to equality for all and its tolerance of all viewpoints.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Deal told reporters he wouldn't urge lawmakers to take any action on the plate.\n\nDeal, who expressed no concerns about the tag after the larger flag was added in February of 2014, told reporters Tuesday that his position had not changed. He said lawmakers have the authority to eliminate specialty plates.\n\n\"I'm not going to suggest to them one way or the other what they do,\" Deal said.\n\nDeal's aides soon called reporters back to the governor's office where Deal said he backed a redesign.

While he was criticized for some of his actions – such as when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up a sex scandal in 2018, a decision he later described as a “grave error” – he has since taken a firm stance on the issues and introduced some reforms.\n\nIn 2019, he abolished Vatican secrecy rules for cases of sexual abuse and put in place new rules that made it mandatory for the first time for all dioceses to set up systems for reporting abuse and cover-ups.\n\nTwo years later, he issued the most extensive revision to Catholic Church law in four decades, insisting that bishops take action against clerics who abuse minors and vulnerable adults. The rules also demanded action against priests who commit fraud or attempt to ordain women.\n\nAddressing the topic, Francis said he didn’t believe celibacy played a role in causing the abuse.\n\n“I don’t deny the abuse. Even if it was only one [case], it is monstrous. Because you, priest, you, nun, have to take that boy, that girl to God and with this you destroy their lives. It’s monstrous. It is destroying lives. And then they come to you with questions. Could it be that celibacy [is to blame]? It’s not about celibacy,” he said.\n\n“This is one thing about abuse, it is a destructive thing, humanly diabolical,” he said. “In families there is no celibacy and all that and, sometimes, it happens. So, it is simply the monstrosity of a man or woman of the church who is psychologically ill or evil and uses their position for their personal satisfaction,” he added.\n\nThe Pope also revealed that he has been in contact with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to him on the phone.\n\nHe said he has in the past met both Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin when they visited him in Rome. But when asked what he could tell the two, the Pope said: “I don’t know.\n\n“I had a dialogue with both [of them]. They both visited me here before the war. And I always believe that in dialogue we always move forward,” the Pope said. “You know who doesn’t know how to talk? Animals. They are pure instinct.”\n\nFrancis has been criticized for some of his comments about Russia’s war on Ukraine. In a June interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa, Francis said the war “was perhaps in some way either provoked or not prevented.” He said that before Russia invaded Ukraine he met with “a head of state” who “was very worried about how NATO was moving.”\n\nLast month, the Pope angered Kyiv by referring to Russian political commentator Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist philosopher, as being among the “innocent” victims of the war after she was killed by a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Apostolic Nuncio to Ukraine, Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas, to discuss Francis’ statement, saying that it “unjustly” equates “the aggressor and the victim.”\n\nThe Pope, who has previously indicated he would be willing to travel to Kyiv and Moscow, told CNN Portugal such a visit was “up in the air.”\n\nNo Pope has ever traveled to Moscow before. Pope John Paul II traveled to Ukraine in 2001.\n\nHe said he was unable to travel at the moment because of issues with his knee, but said that his presence in Ukraine was “strong” because he sent several cardinals to Kyiv to represent him.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/africa/lion-man-killed-ghana-zoo-scli-intl/index.html", "title": "Lion mauls man to death after he enters enclosure at Ghana zoo ...", "text": "1.

Perhaps a biopic or a war movie, something huge in scale such as a \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Titanic,\" or an absolutely singular film like the newest to win the Academy Awards' top trophy, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\"\n\nWhat's pretty clear if you undertake watching all 95 (so far) films to take that vaunted prize – and it's not for the fainthearted, trust us – is that you come out of it changed. You love movies a little bit more.\n\nTo celebrate the latest entry in this storied canon, we're ranking every best picture winner, from iffy stuff where a recount seems in order to the very best of the best.\n\n95. 'The Broadway Melody' (1928/29)\n\nThe second best picture winner, it's a musical dud with vaudevillian sisters and romantic malarkey that could have won worst picture, too.\n\n94.

'Cimarron' (1930/31)\n\nThe rocky drama about an 1800s Oklahoma family was the first Western to win the category, yet it has aged badly with unfortunate racist stereotypes.\n\n91. 'Cavalcade' (1932/33)\n\nThis sentimental tale of family, friends and servants experiencing ups and downs of life from 1899 to 1933 is like \"Downton Abbey\" but not good.\n\n90. 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989)\n\nMorgan Freeman plays a Black driver and Jessica Tandy is his elderly white charge in an emotionally manipulative dramedy made for random cable TV showings.\n\n89. 'Around the World in 80 Days' (1956)\n\nAn English dude (David Niven) travels the globe and meets colorful characters in a flighty three-hour affair. It's no \"Cannonball Run,\" though.\n\n88.

'Chariots of Fire' (1981)\n\nVangelis' catchy theme is the most memorable aspect of this emotionally deep but sluggish British sports drama that follows runners racing toward the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\n81. 'Green Book' (2018)\n\nMahershala Ali plays a Black pianist touring the Jim Crow South and Viggo Mortensen is his uncouth driver in a feel-good film about race relations with a whitewashed perspective.\n\n80. 'Gentleman’s Agreement' (1947)\n\nGregory Peck stars as a journalist who pretends to be Jewish for a story on antisemitism, which probably sounded like a better idea in 1947.\n\n79.

'Going My Way' (1944)\n\nBing Crosby is the singingest priest you've ever seen in the musical dramedy, a tune-filled battle of wills between Crosby's young holy man and Barry Fitzgerald's elder pastor.\n\n66. 'Argo' (2012)\n\nDirector Ben Affleck also stars in the historical thriller (and a sort of salute to the movies) about the CIA using a fake sci-fi movie as a ruse to rescue diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis.\n\n65. 'The Deer Hunter' (1978)\n\nPennsylvania friends (including Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken) go off to Vietnam and face the psychological aftermath.

'An American in Paris' (1951)\n\nGene Kelly stars as a World War II vet crushing on the French perfume girl (Leslie Caron) who's dating his singer pal (Georges Guétary). Awkward!

'Mrs. Miniver' (1942)\n\nGreer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star as an English couple dealing with the early days of World War II in a drama that, unlike many other films on this list, was made during said war.\n\n58.

Here, he plays a savant with autism who reconnects with his brash younger brother (Tom Cruise) on the road.\n\n47. 'Gandhi' (1982)\n\nRichard Attenborough's biopic takes on the tale of the renowned Indian leader and succeeds, primarily because of the spirit Ben Kingsley gives his title character.\n\n46. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nJulie Andrews is a nun who teaches a family of kids to sing and gallivants tunefully across Austrian mountains, while Christopher Plummer rips up a Nazi flag. They understood the assignment, as the kids say.\n\n45. 'The Artist' (2011)\n\nThe (mostly) silent film is a joyous look at Hollywood’s yesteryear, finding something special with an aging star (Jean Dujardin), an infectious ingenue (Bérénice Bejo) and a ridiculously cute pooch.\n\n44. 'Mutiny on the Bounty' (1935)\n\nClark Gable looks strange without his signature mustache, yet he's a clean-shaven force of good in this watery clash as a seaman taking on Charles Laughton's cruel Captain Bligh.\n\n43. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003)\n\nHobbits and Co. finally reach Mount Doom, and Peter Jackson’s massive fantasy trilogy gets its atta-boy.\n\n42. 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' (2014)\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu's innovative satire sets its sights on celebrity, family and movie superheroes, with a gonzo Michael Keaton in one of his greatest roles.\n\n41. 'Rebecca' (1940)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's lone entry on this list is a fitting psychological head trip, with Joan Fontaine playing the new wife of an aristocrat (Laurence Olivier) who can't escape the seemingly constant presence of his dead wife.\n\n40. 'Patton' (1970)\n\nGeorge C. Scott embodies Gen. George S. Patton as a tough leader on the battlefield and a larger-than-life speaker, especially the opening monologue in front of a flag that's a classic Hollywood moment.\n\n39.

'Hamlet' (1948)\n\nLaurence Olivier is the peanut butter, Shakespeare’s Danish prince is the jelly, and they’re made for each other in a delicious treat doing expressionism way before “The Tragedy of Macbeth.”\n\n36. 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' (2022)\n\nThe one with the hot dog fingers! Michelle Yeoh paces the brain-melting sci-fi comedy with the heart of gold as a laundromat owner who goes from needing to fix her tax problems to saving the multiverse with awesome kung fu moves.\n\n35. 'Platoon' (1986)\n\nOliver Stone's Vietnam drama superbly depicts the horrors of war and the morals of the men involved, including Charlie Sheen as a soldier caught between ideologically different sergeants (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger).\n\n34. 'CODA' (2021)\n\nIt's a big, warm inclusive hug of a movie, with a hearing girl (Emilia Jones) torn between the struggling fishing business run by her parents (Marlee Matlin and Oscar winner Troy Kotsur) and her own musical dreams. Have a box of tissues by your side at all times.\n\n33. 'Kramer vs. Kramer' (1979)\n\nDustin Hoffman's best pairing was with Meryl Streep, with their searing look at parenting, divorce and the effects on a child decades before “Marriage Story.\"\n\n32. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nIn James Cameron’s blockbuster, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet gave us a doomed love story folks could (mostly) buy amid a historical disaster. (Jack totally could have fit on Rose's door, though.)\n\n31. 'Annie Hall' (1977)\n\nWoody Allen is polarizing, his best movie is not. The filmmaker's beloved comedy hilariously follows the relationship build and breakup of a comedian (Allen) and a singer (Diane Keaton).\n\n30. 'The Sting' (1973)\n\nSet to a rollicking ragtime score, the enjoyable crime caper lets Robert Redford and Paul Newman shine as con men who eye a powerful boss as their ultimate mark after the murder of a shared friend.\n\n29. 'Ben-Hur' (1959)\n\nThe chariot race rules and the action is on a biblical scale (literally!) in the epic featuring Charlton Heston as a Jewish prince enslaved on a galley ship who plots revenge on the Romans who betrayed him.\n\n28. 'Unforgiven' (1992)\n\nClint Eastwood rides tall in the director's chair, stakes his claim for best Western ever and stars as an aging farmer who returns to his outlaw ways for righteous retribution.\n\n27. 'Gladiator' (2000)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's first Oscar win for \"Joker\" should have been No. 2: He was devilishly top-notch as evil Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's vengeful battler Maximus.\n\n26. 'In the Heat of the Night' (1967)\n\nThe late Sidney Poitier wondrously exudes intelligence and gumption as a visiting detective traveling through Mississippi who helps racist cops catch a killer.\n\n25. 'The Departed' (2006)\n\nMartin Scorsese's sole best director win is for this twisty crime thriller with gangster Jack Nicholson, undercover cop Leonardo DiCaprio and Mob mole Matt Damon.\n\n24. 'My Fair Lady' (1964)\n\nAudrey Hepburn's a hoot as cockney Brit Eliza Doolittle, given a makeover by Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins in the musical take on \"Pygmalion.\"\n\n23. '12 Years a Slave' (2013)\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor plays a free Black man tricked into servitude for Steve McQueen's uneasy-to-watch yet essential pre-Civil War drama.\n\n22. 'Chicago' (2002)\n\nThe rare A-list musical – with Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as jazz-era convicts – that ingeniously treats its numbers as flights of fantasy.\n\n21. 'From Here to Eternity' (1953)\n\nCome for Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's infamous kiss on the beach, stay for the drama involving soldiers in Hawaii just before the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n20. 'The Apartment' (1960)\n\nNothing says \"Christmas movie\" like office drone Jack Lemmon lending his place to the boss for hookups and falling for elevator girl Shirley MacLaine.\n\n19. 'Rocky' (1976)\n\nWith Sylvester Stallone's headstrong boxer, it's the classic every underdog sports drama will be compared to forevermore.\n\n18. 'It Happened One Night' (1934)\n\nFrank Capra's enjoyable and sexy (for the '30s) romantic comedy had Clark Gable's journalist falling for Claudette Colbert's runaway heiress.\n\n17. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1929/30)\n\nThe extremely powerful anti-war film explored the carnage of World War I and the disillusioned soldiers who came home.\n\n16. 'Spotlight' (2015)\n\nSigh. \"All the President's Men\" didn't win best picture. Thankfully this story of crusading Boston journalists and a shady Catholic Church cover-up did.\n\n15. 'West Side Story' (1961)\n\nThe cultural portrayals earn some side-eye, but the musical love story still soars with powerhouse tunes and a phenomenal Rita Moreno.\n\n14. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nIt's problematic for modern eyes, but the Southern-fried Civil War epic still works as a spectacle of unrequited romance.\n\n13. 'Moonlight' (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins' elegant character study of a Black man dealing with his identity and sexuality is an unforgettable, multilayered work.\n\n12. 'Parasite' (2019)\n\nIn the first non-English language film to win best picture, a poor but clever Korean family infiltrates a wealthy clan – as well as the viewer's heart and mind.\n\n11. 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962)\n\nPeter O'Toole's title British officer has his allegiances torn in this sweeping, sandy epic that influenced a generation of filmmakers.\n\n10. 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest' (1975)\n\nA criminal (Jack Nicholson) figures being in an asylum is an easy way to do time, then runs into the nurse from hell (Louise Fletcher).\n\n9. 'The Godfather Part II' (1974)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola's great gangland prequel/sequel unleashes Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as two generations of Mob bosses.\n\n8. 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991)\n\nAnthony Hopkins made us root for the bad guy (and a cannibal at that) in the only horror movie to crack this vaunted Oscar list.\n\n7. 'The French Connection' (1971)\n\nWith an all-timer of a car chase and Gene Hackman's fantastic antihero Popeye Doyle, good luck finding a better cop thriller.\n\n6. 'Amadeus' (1984)\n\nWho said period pieces have to be boring? In the hands of Tom Hulce, musical genius Mozart is a 19th-century wild child we'd all want to party with.\n\n5. 'All About Eve' (1950)\n\nBette Davis' Broadway star freaks out about her age (at 40!) – and Anne Baxter's zealous understudy does not help – in a stellar lesson on celebrity and cold-blooded ambition.\n\n4. 'On the Waterfront' (1954)\n\nMarlon Brando's New Jersey boxer-turned-longshoreman “coulda been a contender” but is definitely the champ of this stunning crime drama.\n\n3. 'Schindler’s List' (1993)\n\nA moving, devastating Holocaust tale about hope and kindness, it's the best Steven Spielberg movie without a certain globetrotting archaeologist.\n\n2. 'Casablanca' (1943)\n\nAs Humphrey Bogart learns, you can stay neutral in war only until love and righteousness walk back through your nightclub doors.\n\n1. 'The Godfather' (1972)\n\nWith violence, betrayal, drama, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the sprawling gangster epic is the cannoli on top of the Oscars' best picture cake.\n\nThe best of the Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columns/brandy-mcdonnell/2019/08/18/interviews-photos-and-video-mabee-gerrer-museum-of-art-in-shawnee-celebrating-centennial/60440490007/", "title": "Interviews, photos and video: Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art in ...", "text": "Brandy McDonnell\n\nAn abbreviated version of this story appears in the Sunday Life section of The Oklahoman.\n\nEncyclopedic centennial: Shawnee's Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art is celebrating its 100th anniversary\n\nSHAWNEE – A full suit of armor dating to 1446 stands next to a Japanese samurai helmet circa 1500, a beautifully decorated ceramic Chinese egg jar from the 1800s dominates a corner near the only two ancient Egyptian mummies in Oklahoma, and a conquistador’s helmet tops a towering cabinet containing, among other things, a pair of shrunken human heads from South America.\n\n“The shrunken heads are very popular around here,” said Delaynna Trim, curator of collections for the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art. “That is part of one of Father Gerrer’s original cases and really kind of highlights some of the eclectic tastes that he had. It was very much the European style of cabinet of curiosities.”\n\nTucked into a quiet corner of Oklahoma Baptist University’s new Green Campus, formerly St. Gregory's University, the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art is continuing its founder’s 100-year-old mission to share the world with Oklahoma.\n\nThe state’s oldest art museum, Shawnee’s Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art is celebrating its 100th year in 2019 with a series of special exhibitions and events designed to showcase the encyclopedic collection of art and artifacts it has amassed since 1919.\n\n“Father Gerrer was collecting everything. We have an extensive collection of art and artifacts from all over the world, including other religions. He was fascinated by world religions. He collected natural history specimens, seashells, wood,” Trim said.\n\n“We have an amazing array of art and artifacts … everything from ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, medieval, Renaissance, all the way to modern. But we also have African, Oceanic, Native American (collections). So, we have a lot of different cultural objects. In the Renaissance and Baroque areas, we have Titian, Tintoretto. We have some of these big names … that you just don’t get to see every day.”\n\nVenerable collection\n\nRobert Francis Xavier Gerrer was born on July 23, 1867 in the village of Lautenbach, Alsace, France. In 1872, Gerrer and his family immigrated to the United States to escape the Franco-Prussian War, initially settling in Missouri and later Iowa.\n\nAfter a brief career as a circus performer, Gerrer met Abbot Thomas Duperou, Superior of the Benedictine community at Sacred Heart Mission in Oklahoma on Christmas 1891 in Guthrie. Gerrer decided to join the community at Sacred Heart, receiving the Benedictine habit and the religious name “Gregory” the following year.\n\n“He became a monk at St. Gregory’s, and the abbot discovered that he had artistic talent and sent him to Rome to study,” Trim said. “He was in Rome studying with all these artists and visiting these museums … and he decided that when he came back to Oklahoma he really wanted to start bringing back some of these things he was getting to see. He felt very privileged with what he was able to see and do, so he actually started collecting in 1904. He decided that he wanted to kind of replicate these encyclopedic museums that he was seeing over in Europe here in Oklahoma – and remember, this is before even statehood.”\n\nOn view through Sept. 1, the exhibit “Journey Back in Time: The History of the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art” spotlights the institution’s beginnings.\n\n“I took some historic photographs of the very early museum, blew them up and then found several objects from these photos to put around them,” Trim said. “It’s kind of a fun way to see what the museum used to look like back in the day … when it was in Father Gerrer’s studio. He had a studio back behind St. Benedict’s Church here in Shawnee; that’s kind of the beginnings of the museum. But in 1919, he officially opened it on St. Gregory’s campus on the second floor of the main building.”\n\nInducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1931, Gerrer was recognized as the leading artist in the state at that time, and he continued adding to his namesake museum’s collection until his death in 1946.\n\n“He taught at Notre Dame for many years, and he used his salary there to purchase pieces for the museum. He also did a lot of trading,” Trim said. “He was well-known as a portrait painter, so he would oftentimes paint portraits in exchange for some artwork for the museum.”\n\nDominating one wall of the museum is Gerrer’s portrait of Pope Pius X.\n\n“It was a very big deal, especially because it happened in 1904. So, Father Gerrer was not only a young monk, but he had just gone over to Europe and started learning how to be a professional artist,” Trim said. “Not only did he get the seating with the pope, but then the pope actually got to choose which painting he liked the best and he chose Father Gerrer’s. So, this was Pope Pius X’s official portrait for a while. And this is the original; he painted a second copy for the Vatican and it still is in the Vatican today.”\n\nIn 1979, the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art celebrated its grand opening in its current home, sponsored by the Mabee Foundation. Trim said the museum has continued to expand its permanent collection of more than 8,000 items, primarily through donations, acquiring more than 430 objects in the last five years.\n\nOne of the museum’s recent gifts, a huge decorative mask from Papua New Guinea, will be exhibited for the first time as part of the upcoming exhibit “The Art and Culture of Oceania.” The exhibit will highlight Pacific Island artwork and artifacts from the museum’s collection as well loans from private collectors and other museums. Sept. 14-Oct. 27.\n\n“You can see why I love it,” Trim said, lifting up the recently acquired woven mask. “He’s smiling. I think kids and even adults will really just respond to him.”\n\nMummy moments\n\nAlthough the museum boasts treasures from all over the world, Trim said its stalwart stars have been two Egyptian mummies, the only ones in Oklahoma. The older and better preserved, Tutu, is especially beloved, and in 2015, radiologists at St. Anthony Shawnee Hospital performed CT scans to give researchers a look under the mummies’ wrappings.\n\nAs part of its centennial celebration, the museum worked with a forensic artist to recreate Tutu’s face.\n\n“What they were able to do was use the scan and create a 3-D-printed skull. So, the basis of this facial reconstruction is the identical skull to hers. So, that makes it very, very accurate and realistic. They were able to utilize that to build up the face … and recreate what we believe she really looked like,” Trim said. “For 2,000 years, all we’ve gotten to see was that beautiful gold face mask, but now we will actually get to see what she looked like in real life.”\n\nThe facial reconstruction will be unveiled at a members-only event Sept. 7 and added to the museum’s ancient gallery. A special Mummy Day with free admission on Nov. 2 will give the public a chance to admire the newly revealed Tutu, who has become a favorite of generations of Oklahoma schoolchildren.\n\nContinued mission\n\nFor Paul Hammond, chairman of the museum’s board of trustees, it is a point of pride that the museum reaches 18,000 children a year through its programs.\n\nAlthough it lost a source of income in the form of shared mineral rights when St. Gregory’s University declared bankruptcy, the museum has kept its admission prices in single digits. For the past several years, it also has worked with local businesses to offer free admission throughout the summer, said Dane Pollei, the museum’s director and chief curator\n\n“A lot of families of school groups that visit during the year come back during the summer,” Pollei said. “A lot of them are from rural areas and they’re coming in to go to Walmart or somewhere. If you have three kids and it’s going to be $3 each for them and you think they’re going to be bored after two minutes because it’s an art museum, you don’t come. But if it’s free, they come and they stay, and the kids will give the tours if they’ve been here before.”\n\nEven after 100 years, the museum is continuing to be discovered, even by those who live nearby. Longtime McLoud residents Janet and Gary Hodde, who are semi-retired, visited on a recent rainy Friday for the first time.\n\n“We’ve been in the area 60 years, but we’ve never been here,” he said. “We had no idea. We had not a clue. … It’s all very fascinating.”\n\nGOING ON\n\nMabee-Gerrer Museum of Art centennial celebration\n\nFree admission summer: Through Aug. 31.\n\n“Journey Back in Time”: Through Sept. 1.\n\n“The Art and Culture of Oceania”: Sept. 14-Oct. 27.\n\n“Unveiling Tutu”: Members-only event 6:30 p.m. Sept. 7.\n\nMummy Day: 1 to 3 p.m. Nov. 2.

Formed in Liverpool, A Flock of Seagulls crashed the U.S. pop charts with the synth-pop smash \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" and followed through \"Space Age Love Song\" \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\" and \"The More You Live, the More You Love.\" Wang Chung made it hard to forget who they are by including their name in their biggest U.S. hit, \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight.\"\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 5.

In the three years since her previous release, the singer went through a divorce, quit drinking, become a death doula, started the observational podcast “What I’m Looking At” and toured and recorded with Loma, the trio she formed with Dan Duszynski and Jonathan Meiburg. After setting the tone with an experimental mood piece that finds her repeating the line \"What is your wish?\" she settles into an album that favors more song-oriented fare without abandoning the eccentricities that make that first track what it is. The result will leave you haunted.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 5. The Trunk Space, 1124 N.

The album follows 2017's “Moh Lhean,” which found him adopting a more reflective world view in the wake of a health scare while at the same time drifting into haunted psychedelic folk. As PopMatters noted, “It’s as if he has suddenly come to terms with his place in the world and that has translated into music which is warmer, looser, and more liberated.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6.

Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. $15. valleybarphx.com.\n\n9/8: Kristin Hersh Electric Trio\n\nThe voice of Throwing Muses is in brilliant form on \"Possible Dust Clouds,\" an electrifying, feedback-laden masterstroke that makes the most of the her raspy delivery to the convey the raw emotions at the heart of her best work. Q magazine calls it \"a stunning, stealthy, faintly malevolent collection of songs that serve as a reminder of this songwriter's power and innovation.\" It's kind of amazing how much of her edge she's managed to retain more than 30 years after grabbing our attention by the throat.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 8.

The only holdout from their glory years in this year's model is Ginn, who's joined by professional skateboarder Mike Vallely on lead vocals.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10.

They're fronted by singer-guitarists Devon Allman (Gregg's son) and Duane Betts (Dickey's son, whose first name is a tip of the hat to the late Duane Allman). And their bassist is Berry Duane Oakley, the son of Allmans bassist Berry Oakley. None of this would matter if they didn't rise to the occasion with an album that honors the family tradition in style and substance.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 10-11.

They're playing Mesa on a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary. \"The Wilderness,\" their latest album, earned a perfect score from the reviewer at the Austin Chronicle, who called it \"textured, ornate, and somehow seeping into the deepest parts of you.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved \"The Wilderness,\" calling is \"thrillingly foreign yet familiar in its finest moments.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

But despite the introspective nature of the lyrics and the way the first song sounds like it was captured in the middle of a dream, it doesn’t feel like the work of a bedroom-pop auteur. Too many of the album’s highlights rock too much to warrant that description, from the richly orchestrated pop charms of “The Bus Song” to the post-punk grinding of “1 Billion Dogs.” And the followup will be here by the time she gets to Phoenix.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

And it's doubtful anyone regretted helping Morris grab that title assuming they came for the country-pop crossover bids that made her such a hot commodity, including a featured vocal spot on Zedd's triple-platinum \"The Middle.\"\n\nDetails: 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 12.

They topped the mainstream-rock charts their first time at bat, with the slashing up-with-cocaine anthem \"Lit Up,\" back in 1999.

The man has been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on three occasions, as a member of the Yardbirds, then with Cream and finally, in recognition of his solo work.

And the timing couldn't be more perfect. As PopMatters wrote, \"'Disturbance' is precisely what the dark uncertainty of the present moment calls for: a primeval blending of ancient ambiance and modern tech, building fast and furious into a soundtrack that batters the fragile Quotidien present with a beautiful rage into which the listener yearns to hurl themselves, body and soul.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 14.

The resulting sheen may leave some listeners wishing for a rawness to match the emotion, but Clash magazine felt it \"lends a progressive edge to the record that takes time to soak in, but ultimately rewards.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 17.

But it got a good reaction when the tour was first announced on social media, aside from which the tourmates seem committed to the concept, going so far as to record a mash-up of the pop-punk veterans' “What’s My Age Again?” and Weezy's greatest hit, “A Milli.” They're joined by Welsh punk rockers Neck Deep.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 5.

Well, he's still on the road five years later, offering the upscale country hits (and pop crossovers) that gave him more than 30 chart-toppers. The 74-year-old's best moments — \"Daydreams About Night Things,\" \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\" and his oh-so-smooth take on Burt Bacharach's \"Any Day Now\" — have certainly held up well.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 6.

From \"Planet Claire\" to \"Dance This Mess Around,\" it still sounds like it dropped in from another, much quirkier planet, wrapped in kitschy day-glo yellow.

As singer Alexis Mincolla describes it, \"If our debut album was focused on man vs. the world, and our sophomore album was man vs. himself, then I really wanted to METAWAR to focus on the idea of world vs world, and the notion that if man doesn’t create his own world then he’s often crushed by the world of another.\" Allmusic hailed the album as a hulking monster that makes shutdown.exe sound tame in comparison.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 15.

And that strikes us as a brilliant introduction. But the more inspired moments of \"Kyle Craft & Showboat Honey\" are closer in spirit to the psychedelic pop years, from the mesmerizing drone of \"Broken Mirror Pose\" to the post-Cream psychedelic blues of \"Oh!

For others, it’s an eye-to-eye contact that tells you this guy has just looked into your soul.\n\nWhen it comes to connecting with fans, the six Desert Trip headliners are part of a small pantheon of musical wizards who can use their art and charisma to build seemingly spiritual bonds; bonds than can withstand a half-century.\n\nTo find comparisons to the artistic innovation and hypnotic power of the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Roger Waters and The Who, you have to go back to Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson.\n\nBACK STORY: Promoter on Desert Trip\n\nDeadheads, Phish Phans, Fanilows and Beliebers might say they get just much as excitement at the feet of their heroes. But interviews with dozens of admittedly excessive Desert Trip fans reveal some have sacrificed family commitments to be on the fringe of a rock star's extended family. Many have seen their favorite performers more than 100 times. Most have traveled the world, paid huge costs and overcome incredible obstacles to see their idols.\n\nRuss Coupland is traveling 5,435 miles, from the Channel Islands off of France, to take his father to Desert Trip for his 65th birthday. Russ, 27, has seen Dylan and Young in the UK. Robert Coupland has waited 50 years to see the Stones.\n\nAloisio Neto and his wife are flying in from Brazil. Jonathan Langille is traveling from Nelson, British Columbia. By bicycle.\n\nPeople call Desert Trip “Oldchella” because the headliners are all in their 70s. So you’d expect the fans to be approaching that age, too. Old lunatics on the grass. Forever young Dylanologists. A crowd that didn’t die before they got old.\n\nBut, some of the most passionate Desert Trippers are under 30.\n\n“I've always said the only concerts I'd care to see anymore are the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and a member of Pink Floyd,” said John Todd, 27, of Hannibal, Missouri.\n\nTodd has seen Dylan before, but the only concert his friend, Tony, had been to was on Motley Crue’s final heavy metal tour last year. So they got to talking about how cool it would be to go to Desert Trip. One thing led to another and Todd soon forgot about his fear of flying.\n\n“One night at a friend’s wedding reception, and a bottle of whiskey later, we bought two GA tickets at around $900 a piece,” Todd said. “The next morning, it hadn't fully hit me yet. All I could think was ‘We spent almost two grand on tickets to a show we have no idea on how we're going to get to!’ Well, over the next few months, and after some careful planning, we luckily found a hotel on eBay for a hefty sum, decided to rent a car, and have a route to and from California that will take us through 10 states and an extra night's stay in Las Vegas. The furthest either of us has been is to Kansas or Illinois. We're just two Midwestern guys about to embark on the greatest road trip of our lives.”\n\nMadison Harris-Weiner, a sophomore at Sage Hill School in Newport Beach, is going to Desert Trip because she prefers ‘60s rock to the music of her own generation.\n\n“I’m 15 years old and living in a generation where the bands I love so dearly are reduced to manufactured ‘vintage’ shirts worn by kids who listen to songs auto-tuned to the maximum and don’t know who Roger Daltrey is. Though they're my classmates and friends I simply do not feel like I belong in this time.\n\n“Then the Desert Trip festival was announced; a rock ‘n’ roll angel in disguise. It’s a mind-blowing lineup with some of my favorite musicians – No. 1 being The Who. I’m now going to be able to hear live Daltrey’s gorgeous vocals, see Mick Jagger’s dancing, Keith Richard playing guitar and Bob Dylan harmonica. For many attendees, it will be their second or third time seeing some of the acts, but for me it’s a glorious first. I might look a bit out of place, but I will feel right at home in a sea of mature grownups who appreciate the time and people who created, unarguably, the greatest music ever made.”\n\nMORE MUSIC: Stones singer Lisa Fischer to perform\n\nAdam MacGregor, of Dover, British Columbia, is 29. He never even heard a classic rock song until 2002. He first heard the music live the next year, at age 16. Now he's what he calls an excessive classic rock concert-goer.\n\n“I once stood outside in the pouring rain for an hour-and-a-half after a Who concert in Vancouver to try and meet Pete Townshend,” he said. “I got to and, of all things, we talked about real estate and whether it was possible to buy one of the Gulf Islands. I paid $1,200 in 2012 for a GA ticket (and got in the front row by camping out all day) to see the Rolling Stones in Brooklyn. I skipped my high school prom to listen to records. When I graduated, I told myself I needed to save some money because if Floyd/Waters ever did 'The Wall' or if Zeppelin ever played a show, I needed to be there. When Waters toured 'The Wall' in 2010, I flew out to Toronto for the opener (2,734 miles from home). I couldn't stay for the other two shows in Toronto because I had to fly back to Vancouver the next day for an Aerosmith concert. (But) I would (follow) that tour a few more times -- twice in Vancouver and again in New York at Yankee Stadium.\n\n“As for the other part of my graduation mission, I accomplished that, too. I got out to London to see Led Zeppelin for the only show they ever played together in my lifetime. About 24 million applied for tickets. I wasn't one of the lucky 20,000 to get them. (But,) after a long battle that involved threatening class action suits, and me needing to write an ‘explanation’ for my actions to the promoter, I won the battle and attended the show of a lifetime. I could only get three days off work, so I flew from the West Coast of Canada to London, where I spent 29 hours in the country and flew straight home.”\n\nMacGregor is coming to Desert Trip because he likes all of the bands, which is something he has in common with fans of all ages.\n\nKolonick was bartending in his home town of Cleveland when heard a Clear Channel production manager tell a friend he was having trouble finding runners for his next day's show. Kolonick said he was free and got a job running errands for McCartney’s crew. The next day, he heard the tour managers stressing over where to find a Sunfish sailboat and how to get private access to Lake Erie. Kolonick volunteered some information and, a half-hour later, he was driving the president of Clear Channel Touring to the airport to pick up McCartney’s manager. They headed to Lake Erie, where Kolonick and the tour manager then arranged for a Sunfish boat to take off from a private dock with a small motor boat following behind to provide security for McCartney.\n\nKolonick watched Macca’s sound check the next day and then got to see his concert from inside the barriers to the stage. After the show, he was told to be at his spot on Lake Erie by 8:45 a.m. and have everything ready to go.\n\nSo he gets to his spot at 7 the next morning, meets a guy from Pittsburgh with a sailboat and assembles it by 8. Just before 9, a security team shows up in a black SUV. At 9:45, another black SUV and a black town car pull up next to Kolonick’s Astro Van and McCartney steps out and introduces himself to Kolonick. Then he gets into the boat and sails for an hour with his security in tow. He comes back smiling, telling Kolonick he made it to \"that ornate building down there.” Kolonick replies, \"That’s the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame.\"\n\nKolonick gets to spend some time just chatting with McCartney and gets up the nerve to ask him for a photo. McCartney agrees and that photo becomes Kolinick's iPhone screen saver. It’s also the excuse he uses for flying halfway across the country to see McCartney at Desert Trip.\n\n“That is why I’m leaving my wife and children for four days,” he says, “to do one more for the West Coast and to see my ‘friend’ again.”\n\nThe following are Desert Trip fans' own stories about how excessive they've been in seeing Desert Trip artists in concert.\n\nBOB DYLAN SUPER FANS\n\nNancy Cobb, 73 of Palm Springs. Has seen him more than 30 times at venues as far away as Berlin. Her most expensive ticket: $230 for fourth row center seats plus dinner this year at Humphrey’s on the Bay in San Diego. Her first Dylan concert was at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1965, after his first \"electric\" show at the Newport Folk Festival. “He was doing ‘Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues’ and people started laughing (and then booing),” she said, “I guess because he was a lost kid in Juarez howling at the moon, and his best friend, the doctor, wouldn't say what it is that he got. I would say that Bob, more than any other performer, has a love-hate relationship with his fans. (They) are among the rudest people who will continue to pay money to see someone who they say can't sing anymore, won't talk to them, refuses to allow big video screens and, worst of all, won't let them record bootlegs on their cell phones.”\n\nRupert Macnee, 69, of Lincoln, Nebraska. Son of the late Rancho Mirage resident, Patrick Macnee, star of TV's “The Avengers.” Rupert's sister cooked for Mick Jagger in the early 1970s, and Macnee saw The Who in January 1965 in London before their first hit. But no one has influenced him more than Dylan. Macnee saw him last June in Lincoln, where he sang “three or four Frank Sinatra songs,” a bluesy version of “Blowing in the Wind” and mostly newer songs. \"It was one of the great concerts I have ever seen him do,” he said. And he's seen him \"40 or 50 times.” He saw Dylan at the Royal Albert Hall in London in May, 1966. \"That was what convinced me I wanted to come to The United States,\" Macnee said. \"To me Dylan was quintessentially American.”\n\nNate Rodewald, 31, Minnesota. Has seen Dylan 10 times. Has visited the house in which Dylan grew up and the pubs he frequented in Hibbing, Minnesota. “My favorite Dylan show was in 2001, Excel Energy Center in St. Paul,\" Rodewald said. \"It was a new arena and they got the hometown guy to sell it out.” He relates to Dylan as a fellow Minnesota native, but says the most he's ever paid to see a concert was $350 to see the Rolling Stones.\n\nTeree Olsen, 57 of Vancouver Island, Canada. Has seen Dylan eight times since 2008, but also saw him with Tom Petty, Tracy Chapman and Santana in the 1980s. “Desert Trip is financially killing me, but I really care not for money,\" she said. \"I care about living this life.” At the Dylan-Petty show in 1982, Olsen said Dylan looked down at her and her front-row companions and said, “Hot enough for ya?” She mostly enjoys hanging out with other Dylan super fans. “I am not a weirdo stalker type,” she said. “I realize ‘weirdo’ may not be a very nice word, but truly, they are out there. One concert a young man beside me would only talk using Dylan lyrics. I wanted to punch him in the face after an hour of hearing him.\"\n\nROLLING STONES SUPER FANS\n\nKristy Giraud, 34, Palm Desert. Has been to multiple shows on every Rolling Stones tour since 1989. Her father, Ray Giraud, hasn't missed a Stones tour since 1969. \"But also, whenever the Stones play we take all of our friends and family,\" Kristy said. \"One of the last few times we went, 12 of us went together. For Desert Trip we have a group of 17. So, we have brainwashed all of our friends to be big fans, too.\" Their most extreme Stones excursion was supposed to be to Amsterdam in 2000, but Keith Richards got sick that year and the band canceled its European tour. But, they're going to both Desert Trip weekends and the Stones show Oct. 19 in Vegas. \"We have been all over. We've done Vegas, we've done L.A., San Francisco, San Diego, Anaheim. Anywhere they are, we go. It's just so much fun. The music, the energy. Oh my God, the energy Mick Jagger has is just amazing. And being able to sing every single song? He (Ray) brought me up on that so I know all the songs.\"\n\nDean Moriki, 58, originally from Chicago, now living in Scottsdale, Arizona. Has seen the Stones 15 times, starting with their 1975 Chicago Stadium show and including six concerts in four cities on their 1997-98 “Bridges to Babylon tour. “I was able to see them in these four cities because the company I worked for had a national accounts director who chose to entertain his clients at each one of these Stones shows – and he chose me to help him to 'entertain' his clients,\" Moriki said. \"To be able to travel to see the Stones on such a tremendous tour while getting paid to see them, wow!” A highlight of those shows was when the Stones traversed a walkway, or bridge, to a smaller, island-like stage in the audience. “One of the songs they always sang on the smaller stage was Dylan’s 'Like a Rolling Stone.' They play that song so well – the feel of that song played live by the Stones is priceless! The other priceless moment was ‘Gimme Shelter.’ Lisa Fischer sang back-up vocals to Jagger on this -- my favorite Stones song -- and would unleash her signature “wail,” which would rattle every bone in your body.”\n\nMike Westman, 53, and his wife, Anita, 52, of Lindstrom, Minnesota. Have seen the Stones 24 times, from St. Paul in 1981 to two shows on the “Zip Code” tour in 2014. Paid $1,599 for standing pit passes to Desert Trip. “Never thought we would spend this much for tickets,” Anita said, “but when I finally was able to get through and purchase tickets, I think my husband actually teared up with excitement.” Her favorite show was in Chicago on the \"Bridges to Babylon\" tour. They sat near the walkway and she slapped hands with Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood. The first concert they attended out of state was in Columbia, Missouri, on the 1994 \"Voodoo Lounge\" tour. They had seventh row seats. \"Driving home from the Columbia show, heard (a) commercial for the upcoming concert in Ames (Iowa),\" Mike said. \"So we pulled off the highway and over to the ticket office of the football stadium and got tickets for this show.\"\n\nLee D. Mackson, 57 of Miami. Has seen the Stones 40 times. One highlight was having front row seats in London, where he chatted with Richards' wife, Patti Hansen, and got a copy of the set list from Lisa Fischer. “Seeing them in their home town was simply outstanding,” he said. “The crowd was amazing.” An off-stage highlight came during a vacation in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, for his wife’s 30th birthday. They were having dinner at a tiny, out-of-the way Italian restaurant called Evita’s when his wife said, “Keith just came in.” Lee said, “Keith who?” Then he turned around and saw Keith and Patti heading to the bar. His wife ordered him not to say hello to the guitarist and he grudgingly agreed. But, after seeing the owner hug Keith, he asked his wife he could ask Evita if she thought it was OK say hi to him. His wife said that would be OK. So he politely told Evita he was a huge Stones fan who traveled all over the hemisphere to see them and, he wondered, would it be OK to say hello to Keith? Evita walked to the bar to ask him and Keith waved him over. “With that, both my wife and I went over and introduced ourselves,” said Mackson. “I was very calm and had a nice chat with him about the Stones. He could not have been nicer. When I said I was a huge Stones fan, he said, ‘Good, we need all we can get’ and laughed that infectious laugh. After a couple of minutes, I asked if he’d mind taking a picture with me. He said he’d be glad to and we took a great picture. It's the best souvenir I could ever want. We went back to our table and, when Keith and Patti finished their drinks, Evita sat them at the table right night to us. We finished before they did and got up to leave when Keith reached out his hand and said, \"Nice to meet you, Lee.\" The fact that he remembered my name an hour after meeting us and was so warm and gracious is something I will always remember.”\n\nJennifer Ackerson, 52 of Long Island, New York. She and her husband, Phil, call the Stones their \"addiction problem.” They played the Stones song, “Wild Horses,” at their wedding. They’ve seen them in a dozen countries, including this year in Chile, Argentina, and Cuba, which she said was “hands down the best ever.” They have tickets for both Desert Trip weekends and the Stones shows in Las Vegas. Phil has met Keith, but Jennifer is still waiting for her opportunity. “We are very avid fans,” Ackerson said. “My husband and I had both seen them separately over the years. Then, in 1995, he asked me as a ‘friend’ if I wanted to go see them in Europe. We went together and that’s all she wrote. We are now married 17 years and have seen them well over 100 times together. We decided Stones and travel versus children and it has worked out amazingly. I think our max on any given tour since then has been 16 shows. I guess we could be living in a waterfront mansion in the Hamptons with all we have spent, but, in my opinion, there is no better drug and you only live once! No one has had more fun than us and met so many great friends and people around the world.”\n\nJim Pietryga, 62 of Dixon, Illinois. Has seen the Stones 79 times since his first Stones concert in 1994 at Camp Randall at the University of Wisconsin. He’s a pharmacist, but he shoots over 1,000 photos at every Stones show he attends. They’ve used one of his photos on their Wikipedia page and he’s been invited to two of their press conferences even though he’s paid for all of his tickets. The first show ignited his passion. “It was so powerful to watch that show so close up,\" he said. \"The interaction between the band members and hearing the music that I had been listening to for almost 20 years live, up close and personal was an experience that would affect the rest of my life.” Other highlights: getting a “high five” from Jagger at a Houston show during “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” and... whatever was his last show. “At this time, the Cuba show was the last one. Very special because of the setting, the difficulty getting there and the wonderful folks I hung around with… I guess I fall into your category of excessive for the Stones.”\n\nNEIL YOUNG SUPER FANS\n\nTerri Haram, 53 of Venice, Florida. Will attend her 60th Young show this fall. Traveled to Europe in 2013 to see him in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Scotland and England, and returned the next year to see him in Vienna, Germany and Copenhagen. She paid $2,500 a night for VIP tickets to this year’s Bridge School benefit, Young’s annual all-star, all-acoustic concert benefiting the Hillsborough, California, school where Young’s non-verbal son, Ben, has benefited from the school’s use of technology to overcome students' impairments. She’s also paid $500 to see him at Farm Aid. She’ll be joining “Rusties” (as Neil Young fans are called) from all over the world to attend Desert Trip. “I’ve had so many special moments with the Rusties,” she said. “But I would say the most special time is: Every year before the Bridge School Benefit concerts Rusties go on a caravan. We meet up in Tacoma, Washington at the Double M (Yes, everything revolves around a Neil song in the Rustie world) and camp down the coast all the way until we meet up with others in Half Moon Bay the Wednesday before BSB. On Thursday night, any Rustie who plays Neil Young music performs at Old Princeton Landing (where Young and Crazy Horse rehearsed before going on tour in 1996). All night long, Rusties go on stage and play Neil Young music. Last year was my first time playing. I don't know any other group of fans that honor a musician in such a way.”\n\nCiaran Cronin, 59, originally from Ireland, now living in San Diego. Has seen Young 81 times, traveling more than 5,000 miles to see him in London in 2002 and Dublin three nights in a row in 2003. “I flew to Ireland in 2002 from San Diego and told my brother to grab his tooth-brush, we're going on a road trip,” Cronin said. “We flew to London and it wasn't until we were close to Brixton on the tube when he saw an ad for Neil's show that he figured out it was to a Neil gig.” Cronin paid $1,050 for each of two tickets to Young's 2004 Bridge School Benefit, headlined by McCartney. “This will be my 22nd straight Bridge School Benefit show hosted by Neil Young,” he said. “I was interviewed by Neil's people and appear on the 25th Anniversary DVD of the show.”\n\nTerri Craig, 60 of Phoenix. Has seen Young “at least eight or nine times,” including the 2011 Buffalo Springfield reunion show in Santa Barbara and three stops on the 2004 “Greendale” tour, where he sait next to Jack Nicholson at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. “Neil Young, in my mind, will go down as perhaps the greatest singer/songwriter of all time when all is said and done,” said Craig. “Yes, that includes Mr. Dylan and Mr. Simon, and too many others to mention.” Craig will spend his 61st birthday at Desert Trip. “Yes, it is the most I have ever paid for any concert ticket, but the lineup makes it a great value.”\n\nPAUL MCCARTNEY SUPER FANS\n\nTessa Reichlin, 47 of Seattle. Has seen McCartney 157 times, from Liverpool to Los Angeles, including 29 McCartney concerts in 60 days in Europe. She’s been brought on stage with McCartney and was put in the documentary, “Back in the U.S.” The late Linda McCartney presented her with a bouquet, she said, on stage in Barcelona, Spain, at the end of a tour she had followed religiously. “To be thanked by them brought tears to my eyes,\" Reichlin said. \"Actually, I sobbed.” The most she ever paid to see him was $2,000 at a PETA Gala at Paramount Pictures. But, “one of my most memorable concerts was in Rome when he played a free outside concert at the Colosseum. I was in the front row in a crowd of 500,000 people. Magical.”\n\nJenna Newsome, 31 of Los Angeles. She has followed him on every tour since 2003. The farthest she traveled to see him was Germany, where she saw him in Munich and Berlin before going to Holland to see him at a festival. She once stood in line for 10 hours without eating or going to the bathroom to get a front-row seat. She missed him at Coachella because “My friend was actually getting married that weekend and gave me strict instructions that I was not miss her wedding.” She’s paid $1,500 on four different occasions to see him at a soundcheck and she has a McCartney tattoo. “Paul usually brings a fan on stage at his shows and in 2013 at Outside Lands it was me! The best moment of my life and I have a permanent reminder of it.”\n\nJoy Yohros, of Panama City, Panama, who would only admit to being over 40. She’s only seen McCartney 24 times, but she’s renting a house to see him at Desert Trip with two friends who have seen him more than 100 times each. While living in Florida, she traveled to see him in Paris and Cologne, Lima, Peru, and Santiago, Chile, and, on a different trip, to Buenos Aires. She once paid $2,000 for a front row package. “The music is amazing,” she said. “The songs are mostly classics and his band is what The Beatles would've sounded (like) had sound engineering been as advanced as it is now. It's (also) about the camaraderie, the friendships we've cultivated along the road -- fans from here, there and everywhere gathering for the same purpose. The concerts are our escape, our safe place, our therapy.”\n\nRick Glover, 62 of Atlanta. Has seen McCartney 142 times, starting with Wings in 1976, and says he has all the ticket stubs to prove it. He’s paid $1,500 for the sound check package for “dozens of shows in the last 10 years and there is nothing like that up-close-and-personal thing.” He’s met McCartney several times and Macca pulled him on stage during a show in Columbia, South Carolina. He’s considered the leader of the Fans on the Run McCartney fan club, which has more than 11,000 Facebook members. “The Rolling Stones are a great little rock ’n’ roll, rhythm and blues band,” Glover said. “The Beatles and Paul McCartney literally changed the world.”\n\nTHE WHO\n\nAlan McKendree, 60 of Austin, Texas. Had seen The Who 120 times before September, when he was preparing to see them five times across Europe. Met the three surviving members in 1989 and became webmaster for the late bassist John Entwistle in 1995. He was banned from his college acting program for a semester in 1982 because he told his faculty adviser -- 10 weeks in advance -- he'd have to miss a performance of a show he'd been cast in because he was going to see The Who. He says his first Who show in Dallas changed his life. “At the time, their stage act included a solid wall of spotlights stacked up across the stage, and they were never used. I didn’t even notice them from the 18th row until, at the beginning of about the third chorus of ‘Listening to You’ at the end of the show. (Then) that entire wall of light was unleashed right at the audience. I realized right then that the band was singing to us, the audience; that Pete Townshend, my musical and intellectual hero, was saying that this line, this sentiment, ‘Listening to you, I see the glory, I get the heat’ -- which I had known by heart for three years and always took to be Tommy singing either to God or his own unshakable enlightenment — the you to whom this band was singing was me, at about 110 decibels. After that The Who was my band. It’s nothing against the other Desert Trip bands. To me The Who were in their own league -- for the artistic ambition of ‘Tommy’ and ‘Quadrophenia’ and for the intelligence, humor, anger, power, spirituality and musicality continued in their other works.”\n\nLauren J. Hammer, 49 of Boulder, Colorado. Has seen The Who more than 100 times from Australia and Japan to Italy and Austria and all over the United States. Counting solo shows by Townshend and Daltrey, who she's gotten to know, she’s seen 160 shows. “I’m not a trustfunder,” she says. “In real life, I’m a lower income, working person. I buy almost all of my groceries on sale. A latte is special, indulgent treat. I almost never go to full-price movies. I buy most of my clothing at thrift stores. But this is my passion. And if you care enough, if you want it bad enough - you sacrifice other things and you make it happen.” Hammer has seen all of the Desert Trip bands and about 1,600 concerts in her life. But says, “Even half of the Who, in their 70s, is still better than anything else out there. The depth of Pete’s songwriting, the power of the music, the virtuosity of the original four, and the passion and energy and explosiveness of their performance is unparalleled.”\n\nSean “Duke” Cassidy, 49 of San Francisco. Saw his first Who show in 1982, after Keith Moon had died, and saw his 100th show in San Diego in 2013. Since then, he's attended shows all over the U.S. and Europe and lost track of how many times he’s seen them. His fall schedule included Who concerts in Stuttgart, Vienna and Bologna in September, and Santa Barbara and Mexico City in October. He has more than 200 Who vinyl records, 80 Who posters, 80 Who t-shirts and a Who tattoo. “I may go to the second weekend to see ’em at the Desert Trip,” he said, “but it is a real hassle. While I don't mind spending top dollar to see The Who, I have no interest in paying big money to see the rest of the acts that weekend. I have front row for Stuttgart, second for Santa Barbara.”\n\nSeth Davidson, 63 of Washington D.C. Has attended multiple shows on every Who tour since the 1970s. Traveled to New York to attend a show on his wedding anniversary -- without his wife. Received a wedding present from his wife in 1997 of a numbered Entwistle print that the bassist autographed, “From My Wife. You get this in the divorce.” “Compared to some of my pals, I’m hardly that excessive a Who fan,” he said. “On the other hand, I’ve taken my wife to London to see The Who on two separate occasions. I’ve slept in a room with 12 other fans in Toronto to see Pete Townshend. I’ve taken the train to NYC for a show at Madison Square Garden, returned to D.C. afterwards and then, when a ticket became available, got back on the train the next afternoon and returned to NYC for another show. I’ve reserved and paid for hotel rooms that I never ended up using because I’ve stayed out all night after shows hanging with fans (and occasionally a band member). I convinced my wife to schedule surgery so it wouldn’t conflict with a tour date. Last year, I took advantage of a business trip to NYC to see the band at Forest Hills -- skipping out on a business dinner to do so. I saw the same tour twice more this spring — both times from the front row. A few weeks later, a buddy with whom I saw The Who back in the '70s and later attended their VH1 Honors show with in Los Angeles, called and talked me into coming to California for the weekend shows. And I’m sleeping in a tent. At 63 years old. My God. I am excessive.”\n\nROGER WATERS SUPER FANS\n\nTerry Makedon, 46 of Toronto. Has seen Waters’ stage production of “The Wall” 10 times in four countries, plus the film premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014 with Waters in attendance. When he saw the start of the 2010 concert tour in Toronto, he said it was “unlike any other concert experience I have had. The whole story of the album was brought to life and the stirring anti-war images really seemed to resonate with everyone in the audience.” But a 2011 concert in London really stands out. “We knew David Gilmour (the Pink Floyd singer-guitarist who was estranged from Waters) was supposed to (do) one show during ‘The Wall’ tour, but not which particular show,” Makedon said. “On the second of the six shows, as ‘Comfortably Numb’ kicked into its first guitar solo, it was clear that David Kilminster (Waters’ touring guitarist) was not at the top of the wall delivering the music. As the lighting kicked in, it was clear it was David Gilmour. The emotional reaction at the O2 Arena was electrifying. Grown men were hugging and weeping. It was clear that this might be the last time Waters and Gilmour might play together and the epic saga of Pink Floyd was at its epilogue. As an added bonus, (Pink Floyd drummer) Nick Mason was also there and joined David and Roger for a final bow. I loved the whole Waters experience so much I actually started a website as a hobby for my friends and myself to review shows.”\n\nJohn McCullagh, 48 of Long Island. First saw Waters with Pink Floyd in 1987 at Madison Square Garden and most recently saw him last October at a private Waters show before 200 people in Sag Harbor, New York. He’s also seen “The Wall” live in Los Angeles and Boston, but, like Makedon, the 2011 performance at the O2, with Gilmour playing “Comfortably Numb,” remains the most memorable. “My wife and I made a trip to London to see two other shows while Waters was at the O2 and did not have a ticket for this one,” said McCullagh. “We heard rumors that Gilmour might be there that night. We just happened to pass a ticket broker in Piccadilly Circus and got two tickets. Once at the arena we had a few drinks and took in the surroundings. As the show went on, I was thinking this would be another letdown. As the first guitar solo of ‘C-numb’ started, I didn't even realize it was Gilmour. I did notice his guitar strap -- Jimi Hendrix’s old one. Once I saw it was it, it was magic.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/02"}]}

(Tuesday, June 22, 2021) — Dollywood officials announced an unparalleled benefit for hosts working at the Smoky Mountains theme park. Through a new partnership with WeeCare, the largest childcare network in the United States, hosts at all Dollywood Parks & Resorts properties can find licensed childcare providers who offer flexible schedules for newborns through school-aged children. Additionally, The Dollywood Company will pay a portion of childcare costs for those who enroll in the program.\n\nThis new benefit comes at an opportune time, as many parents are unable to return to their jobs following the pandemic due to a shortage of childcare workers. WeeCare concierge care managers are available to help enrolled hosts find and tour licensed, safety-certified family childcare homes. Once a family childcare home is selected, WeeCare assists in enrolling the hosts’ children and provides around-the-clock care support. The network of WeeCare facilities includes full-time, part-time, backup, drop-in, school-aged, after-school and overnight care options in the area.\n\n“Obviously, this is a tremendous benefit for our hosts,” said Tim Berry, Dollywood Vice President of Human Resources. “Simply put, childcare arrangements can be overwhelming to most families. It is our hope that this new partnership takes some of that stress away from our current and future hosts. The Dollywood Company has always been devoted to taking care of its employees and this is the next commitment to that. WeeCare can help hosts find childcare with hours that mirror Dollywood’s operating calendar, allowing our hosts more flexibility in scheduling. As any parent can attest, you can breathe a little easier when you know your kids are taken care of; there is an instant sense of relief. We want this to be the case for our hosts. Additionally, we will pay a portion of the costs for children at enrolled facilities, and all hosts are eligible. This benefit is not dependent on income.”\n\n“The WeeCare program adds to the new benefits we’ve provided to our hosts in recent weeks,” Berry added. “We just introduced a new loyalty bonus as a way to reward our employees for their dedication based on longevity and service to the company. Additionally, we offered pay premiums and free lunches for the month of June. Our hosts are what truly set Dollywood apart, and we want to reward them for what they do to make this a special place for our guests.”\n\nWeeCare carries out its mission by providing an easy platform for parents to find affordable childcare including daycares, preschools, and nannies. Childcare deserts, areas where there are more than three children per childcare spot, are a harsh reality for many communities. WeeCare strives to reduce parental stress and ensure they are supported in the childcare process so they can show up to work ready to conquer the day.\n\n“WeeCare seeks to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of daycares, preschools, and overall childcare,” Jessica Chang, CEO of WeeCare, said. “Only 7% of companies provide childcare benefits to their employees, and even fewer provide subsidies, so Dollywood is showing its team how much they truly care.”\n\nAverage tuition for full-time, traditional daycare centers can be as high as $2,100 a month or more, pricing out many families. “Our average tuition for WeeCare ranges from $600 - $850 per month, which is much more affordable,” Chang said. “The reason for this is because we exclusively offer home daycares. WeeCare provides lower student to teacher ratios, are often conveniently located in neighborhoods, and offer flexible care schedules for employees who work weekends or holidays. Since we work with home daycare providers to fill their spots, their overhead is often lower, and those savings can be passed down to families to provide affordable, quality care.”\n\nDollywood launched its childcare benefits program on June 21. Upon joining WeeCare, Dollywood hosts will be able to find the perfect childcare conveniently close to their home or workplace. WeeCare partners with local childcare providers to help them grow their small businesses, supporting them with all business and marketing efforts.\n\nFor anyone looking to join Dollywood’s award-winning team, the company is hosting several hiring events at Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort & Spa in the coming weeks. Hiring events are planned for June 30, as well as July 7, 12 and 21.

Dollywood was represented well among the 500 companies on Forbes’ list of the best midsize employers. The list includes companies across 25 industry sectors, with only 20 companies on the list in the “Travel & Leisure” category of which Dollywood was included.

The park also earned the inaugural Golden Ticket Award for Best Guest Experience, which factors friendliness of employees into its criteria. The prestigious Golden Ticket Awards are given annually by industry publication Amusement Today. This recognition is the gold standard for theme parks worldwide.\n\nHosts at The Dollywood Company receive a variety of unique benefits including access to the Dollywood Family Healthcare Center, along with complimentary Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country admission for family and friends. Employees also take part in Dollywood’s Park Perks program which provides free or reduced admission to a large number of regional attractions, theaters and experiences. A comprehensive benefits package, including medical, dental and vision, is available for qualified full-time employees. Affordable lunch options are available for working hosts at several locations across the properties and are just $2.50 (free in June). Free soft drinks also are available to hosts at multiple locations.\n\nNumerous opportunities are available to help employees develop leadership skills, including a new apprenticeship program in conjunction with Walters State Community College. From part-time positions for students to full-time careers with ample chances for advancement and all points in between, Dollywood offers employment opportunities for a number of career aspirations.

The company launched online sales on May 1, 2021.\n\nThe difference in Green Llama is in its form. Instead of selling cleaners in a plastic bottle, the company provides all-purpose, glass, and bathroom cleaners in pod form. Simply drop the pod in a spray bottle and add water from the tap. The ingredients are biodegradable, non-toxic and naturally occurring or naturally derived. They are scented with essential oils for a touch of aromatherapy. It’s a truly eco-friendly cleaner that eliminates the need to purchase more throw-away plastic bottles.\n\nThe idea for Green Llama was born more than a year ago when Kay Baker, an occupational therapist, was cleaning her home. Baker was tired of buying new plastic bottles every time she ran out of cleaner; a light went on. After a lot of research, testing and many different recipes, she created the formulas for Green Llama.\n\n“I am passionate about the environment and reducing waste,” Baker said. “I love our products because they make it simple to cut out plastic in the home.”\n\nPlastic pollution is a worldwide problem with an estimated 46,000 pieces of floating plastic per square mile of our oceans. This wreaks havoc with an estimated 1 million sea bird and 100,00 marine mammal deaths annually directly from plastic. With increased awareness, individuals can make a big difference, starting in their homes.\n\n“We are trying to reduce the amount of single use plastic while also decreasing the energy cost of shipping water around the country,” Baker explained. “Each ready-made cleaner you buy from the store is more than 90% water. Since you already have water in your home, I removed it.”\n\nGreen Llama estimates if each household in the United States bought one single pod instead of a single-use plastic bottle, we would save 128 million plastic spray bottles from the landfill.\n\nGreen Llama currently sells kitchen, bathroom and all-purpose cleaning pods; sample packs are also available. The company also sells reusable glass bottles for those who have already recycled their plastic bottles.\n\nTo learn more or to purchase, visit greenllamaclean.com.\n\nDo It Yourself Storage in Dandridge sold\n\nDo It Yourself Storage at 822 US-70 Dandridge, TN sold June 17th for $4,300,000.

The project, previously referred to simply as Project 407, has been named “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” The first company that will locate in the development – a flagship Buc-ee’s Family Travel Center– was also disclosed.\n\nBased in Texas, Buc-ee’s is known for its pristine bathrooms, fresh BBQ, friendly service, and providing a unique travel stop unlike any other. With 38 stores in Texas, Buc-ee’s continues its expansion throughout the Southeast with newly opened stores in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and constructing stores in South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The Sevierville location will be the company’s first “Big Store” in the country; at over 74,000 square-feet , more than 120 fueling positions, EV Charging stations, and a car wash over 250 feet long.\n\nKituwah CEO Mark Hubble, who has helped other tribes nationally build tribal-owned businesses for the benefit of enrolled members, said, “Our goal is to be the first stop on everyone’s Smoky Mountain adventure – and Buc-ee’s is the perfect partner to ensure we give our customers a great beginning and ending to their family vacation. This is a business about excellence in customer experience with a huge fan following.”\n\nStan Beard, Director of Real Estate for Buc-ee’s, said, “It is not a coincidence that we chose The 407 as our first big store location outside of Texas. We will be the proverbial ‘welcome sign’ at the front door of the exceptional travel experience that the Smoky Mountains, Sevierville, and Sevier County has to offer. You won’t forget your first visit to Buc-ee’s and it won’t be your last! We are thrilled to share our over the top customer experience and be a pivotal part of the Kituwah and EBCI vision for the Gateway to Adventure.”\n\n“The goal of The 407: Gateway to Adventure is to create a comprehensive entertainment destination with best in class amenities.” Hubble explained. “Sevier County is a tourism economy, and it will take time to grow into a true entertainment hub. In the short-term, we are focused on offering breathtaking experiences people can enjoy on-property for a few hours or a few days.”\n\n“The City of Sevierville has long recognized the importance of development at I-40, and we are excited to see what Kituwah and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are planning,” said Sevierville Mayor Robbie Fox. “With the largest Buc-ee’s Family Travel Center ever built anchoring this development, we believe the future at The 407: Gateway to Adventure will be incredible.”\n\nChief Richard Sneed of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said, “The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is proud to partner with the elected officials and residents of TN on this exciting new opportunity and the vision behind it. Working together, we are uniquely poised to bring an experience not currently seen in Eastern Tennessee, providing an additional source for employment and tourism to the region.”\n\nAdditional concepts being explored and pursued for The 407: Gateway to Adventure include a world-class golf attraction, hotels, an ultimate sports experience, a state-of-the-art indoor go-kart facility, a distillery experience, and unique “retailtainment” attractions that are a combination of both themed attractions and stores.\n\nAccording to Matthew Cross, Founding Partner and CEO of OE Experiences whose company is working with Kituwah, LLC on the project, The 407: Gateway to Adventure has already drawn interest from developers and tenants around the world.\n\n“The 407: Gateway to Adventure is expected to draw 6.7 million visitors in its first full year of operation when Phase I is complete,” Cross said. “The space we have allows us to bring entirely new concepts to market and allows many existing local operators the chance to go big with some mind-blowing new ideas. This is the first of several exciting announcements we will be making in coming months.\n\n“We have been fortunate to have received considerable competitive interest. Our goal is to deliver memorable experiences for our guests that financially rewards Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and allow businesses within the development a compelling and creative environment to participate in and be part of. Quite simply, this project and this property are all about partnerships.”\n\nWhile later phases for the development remain flexible, the organizers say it will feature destination style placemaking that heightens the experience for visitors. Tourists and shoppers will have dining options, unique shopping experiences, and entertainment attractions that complement the overall vision.\n\nThe site’s location allows easy access from nearby Knoxville, something the developers are counting on to supplement daily visits and labor options. Chrissy Arch, Chair of the Kituwah Economic Development Board said, “We know Knoxville residents will visit this location for a unique date night, dining experience, shopping trip, or an easy weekend getaway.

(June 18, 2021) – This week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury awarded $1,826,265 in COVID-19 relief funds to Three Roots Capital (Three Roots) as part of its CDFI Rapid Response Program (CDFI RRP). Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Three Roots will use these funds to make loans and investments across East Tennessee and greater Central Appalachia, helping support job-creating small businesses, place-making commercial real estate projects and community facilities.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Treasury awarded $1.25 billion to 863 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. These CDFI RRP grant funds will help recipients build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves, along with providing financial products, financial services, development services and other operational activities in their communities. Three Roots received the maximum award amount given and will use the capital to increase the size of the Three Roots Capital Impact Fund, which is a pool of capital from which it will make equity investments in addition to loans.\n\nThree Roots has a history of providing access to capital for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and projects in rural or low-income areas of East Tennessee and Kentucky. Since its founding in 2016, the CDFI has deployed over $74.5 million of capital, which has created or retained 1,564 jobs and developed 528,732 square feet of real estate. With Three Roots’ support and guidance, small businesses like Southeastern Packaging Technologies have thrived in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and rural, job-creating companies have continued to have positive impacts in their communities like Outdoor Venture Corporation in McCreary County, Kentucky.\n\n“I founded Three Roots in direct response to the chronic need for more investment capital in central and southern Appalachia and in the broader Southeast. This award allows us to continue to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in low-income and economically disadvantaged communities throughout the region,” said Three Roots Capital Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Grady Vanderhoofven. “CDFIs play an integral role in helping to lift economies, especially in times of need like this pandemic. We are honored to receive the maximum amount of this CDFI RRP award. Receiving these funds helps us continue to do what we do best: providing capital, connections, business coaching and collaboration in our region.”\n\nThree Roots anticipates the CDFI RRP funds could be used to help address an access to capital gap identified by Techstars in their Assessment of the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem of the Greater Knoxville Metropolitan Area. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the University of Tennessee recently announced the upcoming launch of a Techstars Industries of the Future Accelerator in Oak Ridge-Knoxville, which will foster the growth of 30 startups over three years.\n\nAbout Three Roots Capital\n\nThree Roots Capital (Three Roots) is certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and as a Community Development Entity (CDE). Because Three Roots is a CDFI, banks that make loans to, grants to, or investments in Three Roots may be eligible to receive Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit. Three Roots maintains its CDFI certification by making loans and/or investments to companies and projects located in low and moderate income (LMI) census tracts and by providing operational and technical assistance to companies and projects located in such areas. As a CDE, Three Roots is eligible to receive an allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs) and to participate in and facilitate NMTC transactions.\n\nMcNabb Center to cut ribbon on new Intensive Long-Term Support facility\n\n(KNOXVILLE, Tenn.)

(Tuesday, June 15, 2021) – Last summer, tens of thousands of children in our community missed the opportunity to participate in formal swimming lessons, creating an urgent need for water safety education in 2021. Drowning remains the leading cause of accidental death in children ages 1 - 4, and it’s the second leading cause of injury-related death of children 14 and younger.\n\nParticipation in swimming lessons can reduce the risk of drowning by up to 88 percent! Dollywood’s Splash Country is committed to helping bridge the gap to prevent drowning. This year, swim instructors and community leaders will come together Thursday, June 17 to provide a free 30-minute lesson in the morning and offer education throughout the day.

Dollywood’s Splash Country is one of the participating venues, and to build out the event with a greater scope of water awareness, the Smokies’ most-trusted water park created Water Safety Day.\n\n“LeConte Medical Center is honored to be a part of raising community awareness around water safety,” said LeConte Medical Center President and CAO Gaye Jolly. “This event is extremely important to the safety of our community and goes a long way to ensure everyone can enjoy swimming and other water activities. We are blessed to have great partners like the Dr. Robert F. Thomas Foundation and Dollywood’s Splash County for Water Safety Day.”\n\nThis year, Dollywood’s Splash Country is partnering with SafeSplash Swim School for the swim lesson.

However, of Tennessee’s 95 counties, 18 have vaccination rates of 20% or below. Two grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture with funds awarded to University of Tennessee Extension hope to change that.\n\n“UT Extension has offices in all 95 counties across Tennessee, so we are in a unique position to be able to assist with vaccine education and combat misinformation,” states Lisa Washburn, UT Extension community health specialist and principal investigator for the grant. “In many communities across the state and the nation, Extension may be perceived as a more credible or highly trusted source than other government entities that do not have a local presence,” adds Washburn. “Our goal is to utilize local partnerships with the community to increase vaccine rates and continue to eliminate COVID-19 infection and transmission from communities across Tennessee.”\n\nThe first of the two projects will help family and consumer sciences agents in high-risk counties in Tennessee identify specific areas of concern among their constituents, such as misinformation about the vaccines, vaccine safety and how the vaccines were developed and produced. Counties that are considered high-risk are primarily rural, have low vaccination rates, and have higher scores on both the Pandemic Vulnerability Index and the Social Vulnerability Index, two tools used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The project will leverage social media outlets in order to target Tennesseans who are 18-50, as this age group represents those with the lowest vaccination rates. Messaging will aim to correct misperceptions, strengthen vaccine norms and provide information on where and how to access vaccines locally.\n\nThe second, more extensive project is led by Soghra Jarvandi, assistant professor with UT Extension, in partnership with the UT Health Science Center and the Tennessee Department of Health. Working with community advisory groups in counties with lower rates of vaccinations, grant investigators will hold listening sessions to uncover attitudes and concerns related to not only COVID-19 vaccines but other immunizations that prevent disease. Combining the community expertise of UT Extension with the vast clinical experience of both the UT Health Science Center and the Tennessee Department of Health will support the development of community-based educational events and products that address identified issues and questions related to vaccine hesitancy.\n\n“UT Extension,” asserts Jarvandi, “is proud to be one of 24 grantees across the nation participating in this important two-year project to advance the prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination.”\n\nThe projects are funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Cooperative Extension, and the CDC.\n\nThrough its mission of research, teaching and extension, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture touches lives and provides Real.

Broadway. No appointments required. Parents will have the opportunity to choose from several vaccinations at the clinic.\n\nAlthough immunizations are required for students entering preschool, kindergarten and seventh grade, officials say many rising seventh grade students fall behind.\n\n“This happens for several reasons, not the least of which is that kids tend to receive fewer annual checkups as they grow older,” said KCHD Nursing Director Dena Mashburn. “We wanted to offer this special clinic to help students get caught up on required and recommended vaccines and to offer the COVID-19 vaccine.”\n\nSeveral vaccines recommended for this age group will be available at the clinic, including tetanus - diphtheria -acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine will also be available for students 12 years of age and older. As always, parents can discuss the options with KCHD team members and choose which vaccines their child receives at the clinic.\n\nIf families can’t attend the June 12 clinic, immunizations are available at area pediatrician offices and many local pharmacies. KCHD also provides vaccines at its main location, 140 Dameron Ave., and West Clinic, 1028 Old Cedar Bluff, by appointment. To make an appointment, call 865-215-5070.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and numerous other national medical organizations say immunizations are vital in protecting children from potentially serious diseases. The CDC estimates vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2018 will prevent more than 26 million hospitalizations, 936,000 deaths and save nearly $1.9 trillion in total societal costs. More information and recommendations for parents can be found at Healthychildren.org.\n\nMore information about childhood immunizations, including contact information for KCHD and a list of the recommended vaccinations by grade level, is available at knoxcounty.org/health.\n\nAbout Knox County Health Department\n\nThe first health department in Tennessee to achieve national voluntary accreditation by the Public Health Accreditation Board, the Knox County Health Department (KCHD) is dedicated to ensuring the conditions in which every resident can be healthy.

Andrew West/USA Today Network In pictures: Hurricane Ian slams the Southeast Prev Next\n\nFlorida residents assessing storm damage Thursday found collapsed buildings, ongoing flooding, downed power lines and impassable roads, including a key bridge connecting Sanibel and Captiva islands to Florida’s mainland that has been washed out.\n\nApproximately 40 people were taken off the Sanibel Thursday, 12 of whom were injured. Due to the damage to the causeway, first-responders are only able to get to the island by boat.\n\n“The island is in rough shape,” said Sanibel Police Chief Bill Dalton. “The power infrastructure is severely damaged. I would be surprised that there’s a single structure on the island that hasn’t been impacted by the storm.”\n\nSanibel, in Lee County, “got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Lee County Utilities issued a systemwide boil-water notice for all customers effective immediately due to the impacts of the hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n“I just literally got out of a helicopter where I was able to take a complete tour of the entire county and there’s really no words that I can say to tell you what I’ve seen,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino said on CNN Thursday. “The Fort Myers Beach area, buildings, major, major homes and buildings completely washed away with vehicles in the water, vehicles in the bay, boats are upside down.”\n\nDeSantis said Thursday night that he surveyed damage in Charlotte County and Lee County.\n\n“Some of the damage was indescribable,” DeSantis said, adding he saw cars and homes floating in water. “The most significant damage I saw was on Fort Myers Beach. Some of the homes were wiped out, some were just concrete slabs.”\n\nAbout 200 people have been rescued by the Fort Myers Fire Department, Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN Thursday night. The search and rescue operations appear to have come to an end in the city, according to Anderson.\n\nAnderson said city has not had any fatalities. On Friday, the city will open “several food, water and ice distribution centers,” Anderson said.\n\nA boil water notice is in effect in the city of Fort Myers, according to a government statement posted Thursday. “This applies to water consumed for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth among other uses,” the statement said.\n\nLee County – which includes Fort Myers — issued a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nOfficials in Kissimmee – just south of Orlando – told CNN Thursday evening “it’s been a worst-case scenario” for the city.\n\n“One of our hospitals here, Osceola Regional – which is a trauma two-level center – was surrounded by water this morning. Our rescues could not make entry,” Bill Litton, Osceola County’s emergency management director, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nEmergency responders conducted rescues by air, land and boat to save people trapped by the floodwaters. As of 2 p.m. Thursday, more than 500 people have been rescued in Charlotte and Lee counties, the Florida Department of Emergency Management said in a tweet. In Orlando, emergency responders navigating a street-turned-river told CNN they had conducted at least 200 rescues since early Thursday morning.\n\nThe US Coast Guard’s 7th District rescued 68 people Thursday, which is included in the 700 state-wide rescues the governor reported Thursday, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson.\n\nFlorida First Lady, Casey DeSantis, said Thursday she launched the Florida Disaster Fund to assist in rescue efforts. The fund raised more than $10 million within 24 hours of its launch, she said.\n\nThe rescue efforts come a day after Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 hurricane with 150-mph winds, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall on Florida’s west coast. The storm cut a path from near Fort Myers in the southwest across to the eastern part of the state, and its combination of wind, rain and storm surge caused flooding that DeSantis called “a 500-year flood event.”\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\n• Hurricane warnings for South Carolina: Hurricane warnings are in place for the entire coast of South Carolina. In addition, Tropical Storm warnings are in place from Jupiter, Florida, up the east coast to Duck, North Carolina.\n\n• Record-high storm surges: Ian’s storm surge hit up to 12 feet in some places in western Florida. On Thursday morning, a storm surge warning – meaning life-threatening surges could hit – was in place for a coastal stretch from northeastern Florida into an area north of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n• More than a foot of rainfall: Lehigh Acres near Fort Myers got 14.42 inches of rain, and Warm Mineral Springs near Port Charlotte got 11.05 inches. Up to 30 inches of rain may have fallen in parts of Florida by storm’s end, forecasters say.\n\nRescue teams navigate waters to free trapped residents\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I know we all look crazy': Resident shares why she didn't leave before storm 04:14 - Source: CNN\n\nSunrise on Thursday gave Florida residents their first look at Ian’s overnight wrath – and the results were not pretty.\n\nAs Ian pushed inland, ocean water piled up onshore Wednesday – 12 feet in some places – and 150-mph winds whipped. 911 call centers in several counties were inundated.\n\nScott Carlos, who rode out the storm in his fourth-story Fort Myers condo, saw waves of water crash into homes across the street, up to their roofs, he said. Roads are littered Thursday with washed-out vehicles, he told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Everybody’s garages basically just gave out. … Cars are everywhere, smashed up in the street. There’s debris everywhere,” he said.\n\nAs Ian continued moving northeast, heavy rain and flooding has been reported in the Orlando area, where 8 to 12 inches of rain had already fallen and up to 4 more inches of rain was expected. In Orlando, a reporter for CNN affiliate WESH rescued a woman after seeing her trying to drive through floodwaters, carrying her on his back in waist-high water to dry ground, WESH video showed.\n\nIn Fort Myers – where about 90% of electric customers were without power – Fire Chief Tracy McMillion told residents to stay inside, and to stay hopeful. “We’re coming for you, be encouraged,” he told residents Wednesday night.\n\nThe city’s downtown streets were flooded Wednesday with almost 4 feet of water, Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN.\n\nThomas Podgorny was trapped in his two-story home in Fort Myers with three others, watching vehicles float away outside and worrying about others who did not evacuate, he told CNN Wednesday evening.\n\n“I’ve lost my house. I have water and gas flowing through my bottom floor,” he said. “My neighbors have very little breathing room in their one-story house.”\n\nOne couple there was trapped in their home when the ceiling caved in.\n\n“Something is dripping on me,” Belinda Collins recalled her partner saying. “He got up, and the ceiling – the family room ceiling – caved in.” They called 911 and were waiting for a call back about when it would be safe to leave, they said.\n\nIn Port Charlotte, the storm tore off the roof above a hospital’s ICU with patients inside Wednesday, forcing staff to move them to a post-operation recovery area, Dr. Birgit Bodine, an internal medicine specialist at the facility, told CNN.\n\nWater gushed down stairwells to other floors, and other patients needed to be moved either to beds in hallways or to a different, dry wing of the hospital.\n\n“We still have water in hallways that we’re still sloshing through,” but patients are safe in dry beds, and as many as possible were transferred to the dry wing, Bodine told CNN Thursday morning.\n\nPeople in nearby Collier County, which includes Naples, were also trapped in their homes, calling for help, after electricity went out. In Naples, half the streets were not passable Wednesday because of high water, officials said.\n\n“Some are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait. Possibly until the water recedes,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday evening.\n\n9/28 5pm EDT: #Ian will cross the FL peninsula and likely bring life-threatening storm surge on Thursday & Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, & South Carolina, where a storm surge warning is in effect. Residents should follow any advice from local officials. pic.twitter.com/Q8eZ9PfVpg — NHC Storm Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 28, 2022\n\nComplicating matters, neighboring Lee County’s 911 system was down and calls were being rerouted to Collier County, Chief Stephanie Spell told CNN. “At this point the majority of our 911 calls are water rescues,” Spell added.\n\nIn Sarasota County, sheriff’s deputies and fire crews had a backlog Thursday morning of more than 500 calls for help to respond to, the county sheriff’s office said. Deputies were “responding to the highest priority calls” that still were in the queue Thursday morning, the office said.\n\nResidents in parts of Pasco County were also asked to boil their tap water as the water distribution system in the area lost pressure and a water main ruptured.\n\nIn Manatee County, residents were asked to limit flushing, showering, doing dishes and laundry due to power outages impacting the system.\n\nIn Cape Coral, authorities were getting reports of significant structural damage across the city, Ryan Lamb, the city’s fire chief and emergency management director, told CNN.\n\nDeSantis has asked President Biden to approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also asking Biden to grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina braces for incoming storm\n\nWith Ian again a Category 1 hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in Charleston County Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina Friday near or just after these high tide times in the 11 a.m. hour. It’s currently located about 240 miles south of Charleston and is moving toward the north-northeast at 10 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\n“We are looking at an early afternoon landfall,” said CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater. “The entire southeastern coastline is pretty much going to be inundated with a surge again. It’s not going to be what we saw in southwest Florida, but in Charleston you toss in … 7 feet of a surge, the entire downtown historic area is flooded.”\n\nCoastal cities along the East Coast like Jacksonville, Florida, Savannah, Georgia, and Wilmington, North Carolina, could see anywhere from 2-7 feet of storm surge, Sater said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the biggest variable with Hurricane Ian may be “human reaction” to the storm.\n\n“It’s people failing to take the necessary precautions. That’s the real danger that we have, is human error,” McMaster said. “Doesn’t make much difference whether this comes in at hurricane strength or below at storm strength or somewhere on the line, cause it’s going to be blowing strong winds and it’s going to be all over the state at different levels.”\n\nThe US Geological Survey coastal change forecasts released Thursday predicts waves and surges will likely cause 11% of South Carolina’s dunes and 1% of Georgia’s dunes to be continuously covered by ocean water.\n\n“This is the most severe type of storm effect on coastal beaches, with flooding behind the dunes that may impact coastal communities,” a news release from the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, 43% of South Carolina’s dunes and 24% of Georgia’s dunes are expected to be overwashed by Ian. This means sand will be pushed inland, resulting in changes to the coastal landscape that could block roadways.\n\n“Overwash can reduce the height of protective sand dunes, alter beach profiles and leave areas behind the dunes more vulnerable to future storms,” the release said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the incorrect location for storm witness Scott Carlos.

A statement from Defense Secretary Mark Esper says Air Force Maj. Gen. James B. Hecker is being promoted and will oversee the military school, which is located at Maxwell Air Force Base. Hecker is serving on the Pentagon staff in Washington. Hecker is a pilot who graduated from the Air Force Academy about 30 years ago. Air University is the nation’s main site for the professional education of Air Force officers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Department of Health and Social Services reports a person experienced PSP symptoms after eating a clam harvested near Perryville on the Alaska Peninsula, the first reported illness this year. The symptoms can include tingling of the lips and tongue within minutes of eating a toxic shellfish. Symptoms can progress to tingling of fingers and toes and the loss of muscle control in the arms and legs followed by difficulty breathing. The department says some people experience a sense of floating or nausea. If chest and abdomen muscles become paralyzed, death can occur within hours. In the past month, high PSP toxin levels have been detected in shellfish collected from Chignik Lagoon, Chignik Bay, King Cove and Sand Point.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Environmental regulators have issued a high pollution advisory for ozone for the Phoenix metropolitan area. Arizona Department of Environmental Quality officials recommended that people limit outdoor activity Thursday while the advisory is in effect, especially children and adults with respiratory problems. People most vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution include children, older adults, adults exercising outdoors and people with heart or lung disease and those suffering from asthma and bronchitis. Exposure can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis or other lung disease and reduce the body’s ability to fight infection.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: City leaders are planning to draft an ordinance next month addressing a problematic rooster that has been attacking pedestrians. Mayor Jan Larson says the “vicious” rooster scratches and chases people. She says a woman fell while fleeing the rooster, which also went after a small boy. Police Chief Michael Henderson says no one has been injured by the rooster, but his department has received complaints. Larson notes that chickens and roosters are permitted in Jasper. Sara Orlowski, a poultry specialist with the University of Arkansas, says some roosters can be aggressive when protecting their flock of hens. Their mating season is spring and summer. She tells the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that running away from roosters sends them the message that they’re dominant, encouraging them to pursue.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom says he is encouraged by Chevron’s efforts to clean up what has turned into the state’s largest oil spill in decades. The governor visited the oilfield west of Bakersfield on Wednesday, where more than 900,000 gallons have seeped out of the ground over the last couple of months, according to KQED News. About one-third of that is oil and the other two-thirds water. Chevron says the oil spill might have started when crews tried to seal an abandoned well. State officials say the spill does not pose a risk to drinking water. Newsom told reporters Chevron has been forthright about the incident. But he adds that the state will ask the company to turn over data so regulators can investigate the cause of the leak.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Metropolitan State University of Denver is conducting environmental testing at a campus building where four university employees have been diagnosed with three types of cancer. The building is located at the Auraria Campus. According to a letter sent to staff Thursday by Auraria Higher Education Center CEO Colleen Walker and Metropolitan State University of Denver COO Larry Sampler, all four employees worked in the same immediate office area of the West Classroom. Results of the independent testing of the work area are expected Aug. 8. The letter noted that previous environmental testing in West Classroom for lead in the water and asbestos indicated no reason to doubt that the building is safe to occupy.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new analysis shows Connecticut outpaces other states and the federal government when it comes to employing women in the highest levels of state government. Although the report released Wednesday by the Governor’s Council on Women and Girls found women hold nearly 52% of executive branch jobs considered “officials and administrators,” it also says the state has more work to do addressing “representation problems.” The analysis also shows minority men and women earn less than white men and women in executive branch agencies. The average minority male earns approximately $10,000 less than the average white male and female, and the average minority female earns almost $8,000 less than the average white female. Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz says all state agencies and branches of government should conduct their own reviews.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The state’s next medical marijuana dispensary will open next to retail stores on Concord Pike across from Brandywine Town Center. The dispensary, the state’s fifth, will sit between Mattress Warehouse and Sprint in the new shopping center, which also features Metro Diner and Helzberg Diamonds, and will soon add a home theater store. It will be the second state location for Columbia Care, a New-York based medical cannabis company. Columbia Care declined to comment, other than to say that it is too early in the process to provide further details. More than 5,000 people in the state are certified by their doctors to purchase medical marijuana, according to the state health department. Medical marijuana can be used to treat a host of conditions, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and other ailments that cause chronic pain.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some subcontractors for a homeless shelter say they’re struggling to get paid despite finishing work nearly a year ago. The Washington Post reports the Kennedy was the first of seven shelters set to replace a troubled megashelter that was demolished last year. The District awarded the $14 million project without competitive bidding to developer 5th Street Partners, which then hired Moseley Construction to oversee construction and subcontractors. The general contractor’s CEO, Johnny D. Moseley, says payment delays are the result of the city not fully paying the developer, something the city denies. The city’s final $1.6 million payment was made this month.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: Wildlife officials are patrolling state waters during an annual two-day spiny lobster sport season to make sure divers are following the rules. The season began Wednesday after midnight and ran through Thursday. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers were stopping boaters off Miami Beach on Wednesday. Some boaters even approached the wildlife officers’ boat to save time. A saltwater fishing license and a lobster stamp are required to take the crustaceans. The lobster’s carapace must be larger than 3 inches, located from between the horns to where the head meets the tail. Egg-bearing female lobsters must also be left alone. A dive flag is mandatory for safety. Participants in Monroe County and Biscayne National Park can only have six lobsters. The limit is 12 for the rest of the state. The regular season starts Aug. 6 and ends March 31.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAmericus: Authorities say two people are dead after a small plane crashed in a pecan orchard. Col. Eric Bryant of the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office told reporters the crash Wednesday morning scattered debris over an area the size of a football field. He said officials are working to identify the two people aboard the plane who died. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen says the plane crashed right after it took off from nearby Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in Americus. That’s about 140 miles south of Atlanta. Bergen said the plane was a single-engine Cirrus SR22 aircraft. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are sending crash investigators to the scene.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: A Kauai beach park has reopened following a $6 million repair project. Black Pot Beach Park in northern Kauai welcomed visitors Monday for the first time in more than a year, the Garden Island reported Wednesday. An overflowing river in Hanalei Bay washed vehicles into the water and destroyed restrooms and roads in April 2018. City officials have been working on repairs since, the newspaper reported. The repair project included a new roundabout, parking lot, drop-off and pickup zones and landscaping changes to enhance the ocean view, park officials said. There are also temporary portable restrooms located at the park, which will be replaced with new units, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCorrection & clarification: The Idaho National Laboratory, a nuclear research facility, is in the southeastern part of the state. The location was incorrect in the 50 States feature on July 26.\n\nBoise: Employees returned to work Thursday at a sprawling nuclear research site in southeastern Idaho after a wildfire forced two days of evacuations. The lightning-caused wildfire at the Idaho National Laboratory is one of several burning across the U.S. West. The nuclear research complex sits on a parcel of desert that is nearly the size of Rhode Island, and facilities there include nuclear reactors, high-level nuclear waste treatment plants and various nuclear research projects. The wildfire, which started Monday night and has burned an estimated 177 square miles, threatened some of those buildings for a time. But a shift in wind direction on Wednesday moved the fire toward open range land and helped fire crews make progress in fighting the flames. The lab has several safety measures for wildfires, including clearing the ground around each building and having several specially trained fire crews.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The city is receiving more than $2.3 million in federal grants to upgrade its fleet of buses to make them more environmentally friendly. Illinois members of Congress announced Wednesday that the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District will use the money to purchase zero- and lower-emissions buses. The general manager of the Peoria-area transportation system, Doug Roelfs, says electric buses bought with the money will help modernize the city’s aging fleet and help achieve the goal of making the entire agency more “environmentally conscious.” The funds come from an emissions program under the Federal Transit Administration. The grants enable state and local authorities to buy more environmentally sound buses, as well as to acquire, lease or build support facilities.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A proposed 9,200-head hog farm is moving forward despite opposition from residents who say it will hurt property values and environmentalists worried about its proximity to a large reservoir. Farm Service Agency loan specialist Michael Priest says the project’s two barns have received the required permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. Each will house up to 4,620 wean-to-finish pigs. Boss Hog Barns and Snowhill Ridge plan to build the farm in Miami County about 4 miles from the Mississinewa Reservoir and the Miami State Recreation Area. Environmentalists worry farm runoff could impact both sites. The Kokomo Tribune reports some residents fear the smell of hogs and manure will harm property values and the farm will impact their health and compromise crucial water resources.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Japanese beetles and thistle caterpillars have been abundant and wreaking havoc throughout the month. Japanese beetles generally break out for six to eight weeks in early June, but because of the cool weather at that time, the adult beetles arrived in en mass around the beginning of July. These beetles can cause a grade deal of damage to linden and crabapple trees, fruit-bearing trees and grapevines, along with other foliate flora. The thistle caterpillars have been hatching in unusual droves across Iowa soybean fields. Thistle caterpillars are not considered a pest species and, according to Robin Pruisner, Iowa’s head entomologist, haven’t posed a serious threat to crops at any time in her memory. The high number of thistle caterpillars noticed this year could be problematic for soybean plants, though no one is sounding the alarm quite yet.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Two months after Perry Lake flooded, the Kansas National Guard continues to deliver water to residents in a nearby village – and the effort could continue until mid-September. The Guard has delivered 1.3 million gallons of water to Lakeside Village because the community’s water well pumps are submerged after flooding in May at Perry Lake, about 1 mile from the village. Jane Welch, spokeswoman for the Adjutant General, says six guardsmen, using three trucks, are hauling 40,000 gallons of water every day to about 150 homes. The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday that Perry Lake Heavy reached 921.14 feet, its highest level in 26 years. The Lawrence Journal-World reports the Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying for the water hauling because Jefferson County is part of a federal disaster declaration.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: The Kentucky National Guard says more than 150 soldiers are deploying to the Middle East. Soldiers with the 206th Engineer Battalion are headed to the U.S. Central Command Area of Operations to conduct construction missions in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. The last deployment for the unit was in 2006 when it was sent to Kuwait during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Sowela Technical Community College says a $1 million donation from an energy company will be used to give its students hands-on experience in oil and gas work at a new “pipeline academy.” The school announced the donation from TC Energy in a Tuesday news release. The academy at Sowela’s Lake Charles campus will include a pipeline training area at the college’s Process Technology Center. The college says the center will function as a working plant, where students will be required to complete shift work as part of their curriculum.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The Bangor State Fair started Thursday and runs through Aug. 3. The event takes place near Cross Insurance Center and usually draws more than 40,000 visitors. Organizers say it dates to 1849. The event is billed as an agricultural and recreational fair. The schedule includes fireworks and tractor pulls, as well as traditional fair staples such as sheep and rabbit shows. The fair also includes a full schedule of live music, food and games.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A professor who was removed by the U.S. Naval Academy after an investigation into his conduct in class was reinstated to his job by a federal board. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the reinstatement of Bruce Fleming with back pay within 20 days. The English professor was removed in August. Administrative Judge Mark Syska wrote in the order that the primary witness in the case “had severe credulity issues.” He also wrote that the purported victims in the case, who were students, “did not generally take offense or have any actual issue with the appellant.” Jason Ehrenberg, Fleming’s attorney, said academy officials were trying to punish his client for criticizing the academy. Cmdr. Alana Garas, an academy spokeswoman, said the Navy was reviewing the decision. Fleming had been a civilian English professor at the academy since 1987.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWest Springfield: Police are warning hikers to be on the lookout for aggressive yaks. West Springfield police say a hiker in the Bear Hole Reservoir recreation area was charged by three yaks at about 8 p.m. Wednesday. The West Springfield Environmental Committee posted on Facebook that they appeared docile so someone approached within 6 feet. But then “one put its head down, snorted and then charged,” and the other two joined in the chase. No one was injured. Police Lt. Nolan Ryan says the yaks, native to Asia, have ear tags and are believed to have escaped from a private owner in nearby Westfield. Animal control has been notified and has a plan to corral the animals.\n\nMichigan\n\nDayton Township: A man shot ande killed an escaped alligator after he says the reptile lunged at him at his property. Derrick Fells says he was collecting minnows Saturday when he heard a “hissing” sound and the alligator tried to attack. Fells told WEYI-TV he apparently startled the reptile, and it “turned on me.” He says he shot it with a pistol and called 911. The sheriff’s office says the reptile was 5 to 6 feet long. The alligator was shot about 65 miles north of Detroit. Investigators determined that the alligator escaped from a fenced enclosure at a nearby property where an exotic animal rescue was operating. Two other alligators are there, along with snakes, tortoises, turtles and emus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:Even though the 107th annual Benton County Fair, which runs July 30-Aug. 4, has a few new features this year – expanded robotics demonstrations and new food vendors – much of the fair is still the same tried and true family-friendly festival. The fair is free for people to enter and explore the exhibits. People can purchase tickets for rides and grandstand shows. A big tradition is the rooster crowing contest – 10 a.m. Saturday at Cottonwood Stage. Other favorites include free entertainment, such as an amateur talent show and concerts. This year, the fair will feature all local bands at the beer garden stage. And people always seem to flock to the children’s barnyard year after year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Water contact warnings are in place for all Mississippi beaches because of a harmful bloom of blue-green algae, but at other times, water contact warnings and advisories are issued for another reason: feces. According to Environment America, an environmental protection group, sampling data from 4,523 beach sites in 29 coastal and Great Lakes states and Puerto Rico were submitted to the National Water Quality Monitoring Council. Of those, 2,620 sites indicated potentially unsafe levels of fecal contamination for swimming on at least one day, and 605 were potentially unsafe at least 25% of the days that sampling took place in 2018. In Mississippi, Environment America’s report states 21 of 21 beach sites sampled were potentially unsafe for at least one day in 2018. A sampling site at Gulfport East Beach in Harrison County was potentially unsafe for 44 days in 2018, more than any other site in the state. Sewage overflows and breaks are potential sources while others are more natural and washed in by rain events.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson says Col. Levon Cumpton will become the state’s adjutant general beginning Aug. 2. Cumpton is an Army Ranger and combat veteran with five deployments abroad. He earned the Combat Action Badge, a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. He also has served in numerous National Guard activations during emergencies and disasters in Missouri. Cumpton, a Missouri native, earned a master’s degree as a graduate of the U.S. Air Force War College. He will succeed Maj. Gen. Stephen Danner, who announced his retirement.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Authorities say more than two dozen children who were removed from an alternative treatment center are being interviewed as part of an investigation into allegations of physical and psychological abuse. The 27 children between ages 11 and 17 were taken Tuesday from the Ranch for Kids program after state health officials cited “egregious abuse” allegations in recent months at the facility near the Canada border. State regulators have suspended the ranch’s license. Ranch Director Bill Sutley told the Missoulian newspaper that he plans to challenge the suspension. The children have been taken to an undisclosed location and are talking with investigators. They also received medical evaluations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A New York company is preparing to build a 230-megawatt solar power farm east of Nebraska’s capital city, making it the largest solar installation in the state. Ranger Power, which is based in Brooklyn, New York, says it has arranged leases with the owners of more than 1,000 acres near a Lincoln Electric System substation and intends to seek a local permit for the solar farm. The project development manager, Colin Snow, says Ranger has talked to three major Nebraska utilities – Lincoln Electric, Omaha Public Power District and Nebraska Public Power District – about buying the power but has not sealed any deals. The company wants to build the entire $230 million project in one phase, but that could be difficult if it does not get enough power purchase commitments. The company hopes to start construction within two years, and the work would take six to 12 months. The project would create more than 300 temporary construction jobs but only about a half-dozen permanent jobs, says Pat Haverty, vice president of the Lincoln Partnership for Economic Development.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Boat inspectors recently prevented two vessels infested with invasive mussels from launching at Lake Tahoe. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency says Wednesday both boats were quarantined until they could be decontaminated. Chris Kilian of the Tahoe Resource Conservation District says it’s a stark reminder of why inspections are mandatory at Lake Tahoe. Inspectors say they found about 100 invasive mussels – many suspected to be alive – in the hull of a powerboat traveling from Lake Pleasant, Arizona. The infestation was so large inspectors couldn’t remove them all so the boat wasn’t allowed to launch. A small sailboat that the owner said had been out of the water for about four years eventually was allowed to launch at nearby Donner Lake after officials removed approximately 20 dead mussels from the hull’s keel locker.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s recent efforts to reduce the number of patients waiting for days or sometimes weeks in emergency rooms for inpatient psychiatric care appear to be paying dividends. Data compiled by the state’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness show a steady drop in the number of such patients over the last six months. Between January and July, the daily average was 35 people, down from 49 for the same period last year. The highest daily total was in September 2017, when 72 people were waiting for beds. Bipartisan legislation aimed at addressing the problem passed that year, and lawmakers built on it this session with funding for mobile crisis teams, designated receiving beds for patients in mental health crises and supported housing for those leaving the state mental health hospital.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall:The checkered flag will wave for the final time at the Wall Stadium speedway next year, track owners announced Wednesday. The 2020 racing season will be the last for the nearly 70-year-old racetrack. Developer Pulte Homes plans to build nearly 350 homes on the site, which has held auto racing events in some form since 1950. Pulte Homes plans to build 348 homes on the site, mostly in the form of two-bedroom and three-bedroom townhouses, the owners said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has ordered state flags be lowered to half-staff on Friday in honor of a Roswell firefighter who has died from injuries suffered in the line of duty. Authorities say 46-year-old Jeff Stroble died Sunday. He was injured in a June 5 explosion that occurred while members of the Roswell Fire Department were preparing for the city’s annual Fourth of July fireworks display. Stroble was a 17-year veteran of the department.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Portions of two upstate highways are being renamed to honor state troopers killed in the line of duty. A bill signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday names bridges on Interstate 86 in the Steuben County town of Bath in honor of 29-year-old Trooper Nicholas Clark. He was shot and killed last July while responding to reports of a suicidal man. Another bill signed by Cuomo renames a portion of Route 5S in the Montgomery County town of Glen in honor of Sgt. Jeremy VanNostrand. The 36-year-old trooper died in a motor vehicle accident last November outside the barracks where he was stationed in Glen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The bleachers might be a bit more crowded for Madison High School football games and other athletic events next season after engineers recommended blocking off roughly one-third of seating on the home side of O.E. Roberts Stadium. The deterioration of the nearly 50-year-old facility raises questions on how to pay for any potential renovations to the site. Voters in Madison County will again decide on a quarter-cent sales tax increase that school officials say could help generate revenue to raise teacher pay and finance a more than $3 million project to revamp the 1972 stadium. The same referendum fell short of passage in the 2018 general election. In a July report to Madison County Schools Superintendent Will Hoffman, Kloesel Engineering listed concerns with the stadium, including spalled concrete, water drainage and a rotating retaining wall at the eastern end of the home stands between the bleachers and the athletic track.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: North Dakota health officials still don’t know the cause of two pipelines spills last week that leaked oilfield wastewater into a tributary of the Missouri River and another that spread over pastureland. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says that cleanup of the “produced water” is ongoing at the two spill sites. The spills were reported by Polar Midstream. The company on July 14 reported a 20,000-gallon spill east of Williston and about a mile from Lake Sakakawea, the largest reservoir on the Missouri River. Suess says investigators don’t think the spill reached the river. The second spill leaked more than 12,000 gallons of wastewater, impacting an unknown amount of pastureland. Company spokesman Zak Covar says the cause isn’t known. He says the focus is on cleaning up the spill.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has closed five rides at the Ohio State Fair, with one permanently shut down because of “visible corrosion.” Dorothy Pelanda is the director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which oversees the fair. She said Thursday the four other rides could be reopened after minor repairs. The Columbus Dispatch reports Pelanda permanently shut down a Ferris wheel-type ride known as “Military Base” because it showed “visible corrosion.” A message seeking comment on the announcement was left with the company that operates the rides. The state earlier this year replaced about 100 chairs on the fair’s overhead SkyGlider and added a braking system. An 18-year-old man was killed and seven people were injured when the spinning, swinging Fire Ball ride broke apart in July 2017.\n\nOklahoma\n\nKingfisher: No injuries or damage have been reported following a small earthquake in central Oklahoma, the fourth such earthquake in the area in less than three weeks. The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 3.1 temblor was recorded at 4:39 a.m. Thursday near Kingfisher, about 40 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. A 3.1 magnitude quake and two 2.6 magnitude quakes were recorded in the same area, all on July 9. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The cost of a liquor license in Oregon is going up for the first time in 70 years after newly passed legislation doubled the amount the agency will charge bars, restaurants, breweries and wineries for the right to sell alcohol to customers. The law moves Oregon’s liquor fees from among the cheapest in the nation to just below the national average for such fees, but the agency says getting on a par with other states was not the motivation. Starting Oct. 1, a full liquor license will be $800, up from $400, and winery or brewery license fees will increase from $250 to $500. All other fees will also double on and after that date.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddleburg: A bracelet that belonged to a soldier from Pennsylvania killed during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II will be returned to his daughter. An off-duty detective using a metal detector in Wales discovered the silver bracelet that contained Albert Coleman’s name and serial number. Colin Murphy tells The Daily Item he used the information to trace Coleman to Snyder County. The county historical society says Coleman got married after high school and he and his wife had a daughter. Board member Esther Klinger says the daughter was 18 months old when Coleman was killed on Jan. 17, 1945. He was buried in Pennsylvania. Coleman’s unit had been stationed in Wales before shipping off. The bracelet will be presented to his daughter, Nancy Shilling, during a ceremony at the society’s headquarters on Sunday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A delay in an international flight route coupled with airline service cuts has left T.F. Green Airport with fewer passengers. WPRI-TV reports that the airport has been seeing a fall in flights. Overall passenger activity at the airport fell more than 14% in April. Seat capacity declined by 18.5%. Regional Sky last year announced a direct flight from T.F. Green to Montreal to start in November 2018. It was later pushed to 2019. The company’s president says the airline wasn’t getting enough customers to “justify one flight.” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the agency that runs the airport, tells the board the cause of the decline is because of Southwest and other airline cuts. The airlines blame the global grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson:An estimated 600 to 700 members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club are set to ride into Clemson from July 29 to Aug. 2 for their national gathering. “They’ll come in, have a meeting, get together,” Kade Herrick, tourism director for the Clemson Area Chamber of Commerce, said. “It is almost like a family reunion for them.” News of the event, originally shared by the Seneca Journal, sparked mixed responses on social media, with some residents upset that the city had not told citizens about the event. Others were excited about the chance for businesses to bring in revenue during the slower summer months. The Department of Justice classifies Hells Angels as an “outlaw motorcycle gang“ and says the group is involved in the production of drugs and in other criminal activity. Herrick says he does not have concerns about the club coming to Clemson and did “due diligence,” reaching out to officials in Missouri and in Clarksville, Virginia, to learn about the results of similar events there.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Police will hold a town hall in east Sioux Falls on Tuesday to address several gunshot incidents in the area. Officers have responded to 10 reports of gunshots since July 8, and all have been on the east side of the city — mostly concentrated in the northeast part of Sioux Falls. The town hall will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the Kenny Anderson Community Center on East Third Street, , says Capt. Loren McManus. The recent shootings have been in the evening or before 6 a.m. In each case, police responded to witnesses saying they heard the gunshots, but officers rarely got an eyewitness account. This leaves them with little information for the search for suspects, McManus said. Background investigations have led police to believe that a majority of the shootings involve gang activity. At least two of the shootings occurred at a gang member’s home known to investigators, McManus told the Argus Leader.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:A bridge on Asheville Highway was named to honor the three victims of the fatal 2014 Knox County Schools bus crash. State Rep. Rick Staples, D-Knoxville, and State Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, R-Knoxville, held a ceremony to unveil the signs that will be displayed along Asheville Highway, near the Holston River. Zykia Burns, Seraya “Bubbles” Glasper and Kimberly Wester-Riddle died on Dec. 2, 2014, when a bus from Chilhowee Intermediate School struck a bus from Sunnyview Primary School. Burns was 6, Glasper was 7 and Riddle was 46. The bus from Chilhowee swerved across Asheville Highway and struck the bus from Sunnyview, which Burns, Glasper and Riddle were riding. It was learned that the driver of the bus from Chilhowee, James Davenport, was texting while driving, which caused him to swerve and led to the fatal crash.\n\nTexas\n\nAmarillo: A school district in the Texas Panhandle will begin drug testing students as young as 12 years old who are interested in playing sports or participating in other extracurricular activities. Testing will begin with the resumption of classes next month at Bushland Independent School District and will be required of students in grades seven through 12 who play in the band, sit on the student council, assemble a yearbook, play chess or participate in other clubs. Students who receive a permit to park at the high school also will be subjected to testing. The district does not have a drug problem or growing epidemic, district Assistant Superintendent Angie Watson said Wednesday, but the purpose is to keep students safe and “deter them from doing anything that would harm them.”\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Ogden: Officials are searching for a source of possible contamination after dozens of fish and a few ducks were found dead in a creek. KUTV-TV reports children fishing in Burch Creek discovered the dead fish and called 911 on Wednesday afternoon. The South Ogden Fire Department says nearby residents also reported smelling gas in the area. The department says between 40 and 50 fish were found dead. The Weber County Health Department says it was testing the water to determine the cause and source. The creek flows into the Weber River.\n\nVermont\n\nSalisbury: Several communities are seeing an abundance of a particular frog this summer. University of Vermont herpetology lecturer James Andrews estimates that the population of the northern leopard frog has leaped a hundredfold in a region near the Otter Creek in Addison County primarily because of the wet spring. He estimates that 400,000 young frogs were killed by cars in Salisbury. Some of the dried up carnage is still visible on the road. Andrews says the northern leopard frog lays eggs in grassy flood plains of the Otter Creek. Usually, the flood plains dry up and many of the eggs do too, but that didn’t happen this year. He says people who have been here for 30 years or more say they have never seen so many frogs.\n\nVirginia\n\nKing George: A bald eagle injured in a fight at an area landfill last month is ready to fly again. The Wildlife Center of Virginia plans to release the eagle Friday in Caledon State Park. The adult female bird was found on the ground, fighting with another eagle at the King George County landfill on June 15. The bird was treated for lead exposure and mild trauma from its fight with the other eagle. The bird has spent the past few weeks in the center’s outdoor pens, building up strength and stamina. The state park where the eagle will be released is the summer home for one of the largest concentrations of bald eagles on the East Coast.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is rolling out same-day voter registration for the primary election next month. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that residents for the first time will be able to register or update their existing registrations at county auditor or elections offices until the end of the primary period on Aug. 6. The new state law allows people to register by mail or online until eight days before an election. The state previously cut off mail and online registrations at the 29-day mark. The state also requires counties to operate voting centers in cities of more than 100,000 people during presidential elections. Several voting centers are opening in the Seattle area despite not being a presidential-election year. King County Elections Director Julie Wise says they’re testing the concept this year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s congressional delegation is asking Presdient Donald Trump to authorize federal disaster relief funds after flash flooding damaged the state’s eastern highlands late last month. U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito joined U.S. Reps. David McKinley, Alex Mooney and Carol Miller in a joint statement Wednesday asking for the federal disaster declaration. Severe thunderstorms hit Grant, Pendleton, Preston, Tucker and Randolph counties on June 29, leading to flooding and evacuations. Homes were knocked off their foundations and bridges and roads were washed out, including parts of four-lane U.S. Route 33. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has declared an emergency and the West Virginia National Guard is helping with some of the cleanup.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin would be able to increase tuition no greater than the rate of inflation under a bill being proposed in the state Legislature by the chairman of the Assembly’s higher education committee. The proposal envisions a time without a tuition freeze that has been in place for six years and will run for at least two more. The Wisconsin State Journal reports Wednesday that Republican Rep. Dave Murphy plans to introduce a bill that would allow the UW Board of Regents to raise tuition by the consumer price index increase each year. It would also lock tuition at the same rate a student pays their first year over the next three. Republican state Sen. Andre Jacque is also behind the bill, which wouldn’t take effect until the 2021 school year at the earliest.\n\nWyoming\n\nFort Laramie: Gov. Mark Gordon has declared a state of emergency to help farmers in Wyoming and Nebraska affected by an irrigation system failure. Gordon says Monday’s declaration will enable the state to deploy workers and equipment to try to solve the problem that has left more than 150 square miles of cropland without irrigation water at the peak of summer. The problem began when a 14-foot-wide tunnel for irrigation water collapsed July 17. The backed-up water washed out an irrigation canal, flooding nearby farmland. The Casper Star-Tribune reports about half of the farmland now without irrigation water is in Wyoming and the other half is in Nebraska. Crops grown there include corn and sugar beets. Repairing the irrigation system will take an estimated two to four weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/26"}]}

But Delaware was where the Sussex Tech graduate from Georgetown always wanted to play. The Blue Hens didn’t share that interest.\n\n“It means everything, everything,” he said of getting the winning bucket. “My family’s here. My family’s so happy for me because they know, they honestly know, that I wanted to be here. This is something I’m gonna tell my kids in 20 years.”\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Larkin had team highs of 22 points and 13 rebounds as Delaware State, under first-year coach Eric Skeeters, improved to 3-8. Saleik Edwards scored 18 points.\n\nThe Hornets’ only previous wins were against Division III College of St. Elizabeth and Cairn. In eight previous games against Division I foes this year, DSU had been outscored by an average of 28 points with the closest loss by 16.\n\n“At this point in time, we were just trying to get better every day. We’re laying the foundation, so I want to just keep continuing to fight,” said Skeeters, an assistant at UMBC the last two seasons. “We wanted to play a good second half. That was the goal.”\n\nDSU, which led 38-34 at halftime Wednesday, had played several strong first halves this season but not been able to maintain it.\n\nThis time the Hornets did, keyed by 8-for-13 (61.5 percent) three-point aim in the second half. For the game, DSU was 13-for-27 (48.1 percent) on threes.\n\n“I feel like a lot of teams play down to us,” Larkin said. “They look down on us because of our record and where we might be ranked in the nation. We decided to come out here and play hard and it showed.”\n\nSure enough, Delaware senior forward Eric Carter said the Blue Hens were guilty of too carefree an approach in what he said is DSU’s “number-one game and their Super Bowl.”\n\nDelaware (8-5) closed the nonconference portion of its schedule before beginning Colonial Athletic Association play Dec. 28 at Hofstra.\n\n“We’ve gotta be able to learn from this,” said Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby, who was critical of his team’s defensive diligence. “ . . . They just were quicker to the basketball than us and wanted it more. It was a huge game for both of us being in-state and they out-toughed us.”\n\nThe Blue Hens never led in the game’s final 23 minutes but had closed several seven-point gaps to tie it 71-71 on Ithiel Horton’s 3-pointer with 16 seconds left. Horton missed a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer.\n\n“They wanted it more,” Carter said. “. . . It’s plain and simple. Guys were checked out, thought it was gonna be a cakewalk.”\n\nDelaware still leads the all-time series against Delaware State 14-5 but had its three-game win streak against DelState snapped.\n\nCarter had game highs of 23 points and 15 rebounds. Delaware also got 13 points from Matt Veretto, 11 from Kevin Anderson and 10 from Ryan Allen.\n\nBut Delaware had a tough night from the perimeter in contrast to Delaware State’s, the Hens going 6-for-30 on 3-pointers (20 percent).\n\n“We’ve gotta go back to the drawing board defensively,” Ingelsby said. “We’re not a very good defensive team right now. But give them credit. They were fabulous. They played really well. They made big shot after big shot. But on our home floor we’ve gotta be better defensively and dig in and get stops when we need to.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Some even broached the idea of him joining their staffs.\n\nDSU TABS WATERMAN: Sanford coach hired for men’s hoops\n\nThat all helped earn Waterman spots on United States youth team coaching staffs, which are not doled out liberally or thoughtlessly. Sone of the gold medals Waterman owns have acronyms other than DIAA emblazoned upon them.\n\nA reliable point guard at what was then called Howard Career Center in Wilmington and then the University of Delaware, Waterman certainly knows how to assist.\n\nMore importantly, his leadership skills are astute, and Delaware State will need them.\n\n“This will be his first foray into the college ranks, but I think he’s proven himself,” said DSU president Tony Allen, who was impressed enough along with school officials to choose Waterman. “He earned his right. He really blew us away.”\n\nIt certainly wouldn’t be unprecedented for Waterman to make a successful jump from prep to collegiate hoops.\n\nBob McKillop coached Long Island Lutheran to five New York state titles over 10 years before, in 1989, becoming coach at Davidson, where he had spent one season as an assistant 11 years before. With a little help from Steph Curry, he has guided Davidson to 607 wins and nine NCAA Tournament berths since.\n\nVillanova’s Jay Wright, who has recruited and coached several Sanford players, said this in DSU’s official announcement Friday of Waterman’s hiring:\n\n“Stan is well prepared for this challenge. I respect him as an outstanding leader in our game. His basketball knowledge and experiences are elite. His leadership and inspirational skills have produced winning teams and outstanding collegiate players throughout his career. His passion and dedication to the state are unmatched. Delaware State University has made a great choice in Stan Waterman.”\n\nThere are 347 NCAA Division I men’s basketball programs, and their head coaching positions are among the most coveted in U.S. sports. The DSU post had 90-plus applicants, Allen said.\n\nSuch jobs typically have high pay, high prestige and high pressure, though the quantities of each are certainly lesser at a place like DSU in a conference such as the MEAC.\n\nBut because Delaware State is in the MEAC, there is a golden opportunity.\n\nThe league has no consistent traditional powerhouse and has also undergone major change. The departures this summer of North Carolina A&T to the Big South and Florida A&M and Bethune-Cookman to the SWAC will leave the MEAC with eight schools.\n\nCOACH OF THE YEAR: Waterman earns DSBA Tubby Raymond Award\n\nDespite its recent struggles, going 9-51 in MEAC games the last four years, Delaware State is certainly positioned for a return to prominence if Waterman can attract the players with the right talent and temperament.\n\nThe success of basketball and other college teams nowadays is often constructed upon a unified culture encompassing aspects that go beyond jump shots and rebounds, though making and getting many of those remains integral. It’s about building that foundational ethos, which includes social and academic success along with basketball achievement.\n\n“Establishing a work ethic, a positive attitude, having success, competing in the classroom as well as on the court, being involved in the community,” Waterman said.\n\nThe fact that transfers no longer have to sit out a year certainly allows for quicker rebuilding opportunities, and the portal is overflowing with players looking for new places to land. Among them is Mikey Dixon, the 2016 Sanford grad who was state Player of the Year as a senior and has already played at Quinnipiac, St. John’s and Grand Canyon State.\n\nBut the portal is also where one has to be choosy.\n\n“While you can find some talent in the portal,” Waterman said, “there are also somebody else’s problems in there, too.”\n\nMost importantly, Waterman and his still-unnamed staff have a chance during the crucial July recruiting period to lay the groundwork with prospects presently in high school who are now beginning to earn and weigh scholarship opportunities.\n\nCertainly, Waterman being at Delaware State will make it a more attractive destination to First State prospects who have Division I talent.\n\nThe Hornets have been down for so long, there really is nowhere to go for them but up.\n\nIn Waterman, DSU has hired someone who has scaled the heights before, albeit at a different level, and has the character and competence to get it there.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Fifteen months and four days were a long time to wait for the next kickoff, especially for a program itching to show improvement.\n\nDelaware State’s last winning season was in 2012. In the six seasons from 2014 through 2019 the Hornets went 10-58.\n\nSo the most important aspect of Saturday’s victory was it did indicate a hint of progress.\n\nDelState had lost four straight to Howard, its oldest rival, since its lone 2015 win came over the Bison. In addition, it was the Hornets’ first season-opening triumph since 2012 against VMI.\n\nTheir improvement was far more evident on defense, where the Hornets have numerous playmakers, than on offense, where they mustered only 140 total yards.\n\n“Still got a lot of work to do,” said third-year coach Rod Milstead, the former Hornets All-American offensive lineman who went on to win a Super Bowl with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nUNFAIR TO COMPARE: HBCU schools such as DSU regularly get APR penalties\n\n“This one is kinda bittersweet. Good to win when you don’t play well. The defense took a major step today, but offensively we started off too slow. But when we needed it, we got it done.”\n\nDown 3-2, DelState scored the touchdown it needed with 9:38 left on quarterback Jared Lewis’ 2-yard keeper, with Lewis then completing a 2-point pass to tight end Myles Beverly. The 7-play, 41-yard series was set up by a Howard punt that skidded along the turf. Lewis had entered the game in the second quarter when returning starter and fellow sophomore Tylik Bethea hurt his knee.\n\n“We were so ready to play this game,” Lewis said.\n\nMilstead said he wasn’t sure Saturday’s game would take place until he saw Howard’s equipment truck pull up early Saturday morning. Of course, future games depend on players, coaches and others associated with the team avoiding the coronavirus, which, as fall football showed, is no easy task.\n\n“It’s probably the first football game I’ve ever been a part of where there were no fans, no bands, no barbecue,” Milstead said, “so it was a little bit different. But once the ball’s kicked it’s football and that’s something we wanted to do.”\n\nDSU has four more games scheduled, including a rematch with Howard in Washington, D.C., on March 27. The Hornets face South Carolina State, the only other MEAC school playing spring football, March 13 in Orangeburg and April 3 in Dover.\n\nSPRING FORTH: 5 keys to success as Hens set to start\n\nThen comes the historic first visit from Delaware to Delaware State on April 10.\n\nMilstead praised the unity, enthusiasm and diligence his players showed in staying focused through the 2020 season’s cancellation and continuing to try to get better for whenever play did resume.\n\n“When our season got kicked back,” he said, “they didn’t care. They came out here to work every single day and you saw it today. We’re a much better football program than we were when we ended up in 2019.\n\n“I’m excited on the process. I always said year three would be the year that we see the biggest change going forward. It’s kind of crazy but we’re going to have year three and year four in the same year.''\n\nAlso looking ahead, the end of NCAA Division III sports this spring at Wesley College because of DSU’s purchase of the Dover private institution allows the Hornets to tap into the Wolverines’ nationally prominent football program. Some players were recruited by or even signed with Division I schools.\n\nDelaware State’s offensive coordinator is Steve Azzanesi, the former St. Elizabeth High and Wesley quarterback who served 18 years on the Wesley staff including the last two as offensive coordinator before coming to DSU in 2020.\n\n“We would like to get a couple of those guys to come over here with us and finish out their careers right here at DelState,” Milstead said. “They have some guys who can play at this level.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

They had a 21-game losing streak.\n\nUnder Walker, Delaware State went 43-96 overall and 27-44 in MEAC games. His 2014-15 team reached the MEAC title game before losing to Hampton and finished 18-18. He’d been coach since January of 2014.\n\nAssistant head coach Keith Johnson had been serving as interim coach and was a finalist for the full-time position.\n\n“Delaware State University is a unique opportunity and I look forward to putting together a staff and team that will enable us to create something special,” Skeeters said in the DSU statement. “As a MEAC grad, my goal from day one will be to recruit, coach and develop champions on the court, in the classroom and in the community.”\n\nDelaware State reached its lone NCAA Tournament as MEAC champ in 2005 and won MEAC regular-season titles in 2006 and 2007, when it had NIT berths.\n\nIn addition to serving on Coppin State and UMBC staffs, Skeeters has also been an assistant coach at Towson, Virginia Tech, Youngstown State, South Florida and George Mason. The Baltimore native (Woodlawn High) played basketball and lacrosse at Catonsville Community College.\n\n“Eric has worked extremely hard during his coaching career for an opportunity like is being presented at Delaware State,” UMBC coach Ryan Odom said in the DSU statement.\n\n“Coach Skeeters was a vital part of our historic run at UMBC this past season. I have seen first-hand the impact that he had on our players in helping them reach both their academic and athletic goals.

We hope to continue and expand this educational partnership next year.”\n\nThe New England-style juicy, hazy IPA is the culmination of formulation and brewing efforts by students in the court and is named after UD’s mascot and athletic teams, the Blue Hens. Blue Hen Haze was brewed with Cascade and Centennial hops and dry-hopped with El Dorado and Galaxy hops, creating zesty notes of citrus and tropical fruits, according to Iron Hill.\n\n“Over the years, Iron Hill has collaborated with the University of Delaware through several events. However, sharing our expertise and highlighting the deep bench of brewing talent with undergraduate students was truly special,” said Mark Edelson, founder and vice president of beer for Iron Hill.\n\nWhile there are plenty of jokes to make about college kids who spend a lot of their time downing beers turning the tables and brewing up some of their own, we’ll get straight to the point and share that Blue Hen Haze is now on tap at Iron Hill’s Newark and Wilmington locations.\n\nVisit Iron Hill in Newark at 147 E.

With sunny weather forecast for the three-day holiday weekend, that means most beachgoers can leave their worries behind.\n\nThere could still be a risk of minor coastal flooding and strong rip currents going into the weekend, though, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA HAPPY BEACH TALE:At 90, Funland's Al Fasnacht still making Rehoboth Beach families smile\n\nEarlier this week, strong wind and waves created mini cliffs in some stretches of beach along the Atlantic Ocean. Most, except for the beach just north of the Indian River Inlet in Delaware Seashore State Park, have returned to normal.\n\nThe natural process, called scarping, happens every year along the ocean coast. But this year, it has happened a bit earlier than normal, said Michael Powell with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources.\n\nEyeing the weather\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Sarah Johnson said rough waves began late Saturday into Sunday, as a large area of high pressure to the north drove strong, easterly winds into the shore.\n\n“As a result, we’ve seen some rough surf, which is common when we have prolonged onshore flow — those winds blowing toward the shore,” she said. “They’re blowing over a longer fetch — which is the distance over the water — that helps build up the wave heights.”\n\nThat also has caused some minor coastal flooding in the Delmarva region, which could continue through Thursday and Friday's high tides.\n\n“The good news is that high pressure system is weakening,” Johnson said Tuesday. That means wave heights also will weaken, and the situation will ease on the scarped beaches.\n\nMeanwhile, hurricane season is ramping up as Hurricane Dorian heads through the Caribbean toward Florida.\n\nA second system, Post-Tropical Cyclone Erin, is stirring things up in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 miles off the East Coast. The storm will pass by Delaware Thursday and speed up as it weakens and heads north/northeast.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the track of both systems showed little impacts to the Delmarva area, meteorologists said.\n\n\"We're not expecting too much from it,\" weather service meteorologist Nick Carr said of Tropical Depression Erin. The system could potentially produce moderately dangerous rip current risks on Thursday.\n\nAs for Dorian, he said, Delawareans could see some moisture from the storm late next week after it makes landfall. Weather experts expect it to hit the Florida coast as a major hurricane by Monday.\n\nOther than that, Labor Day weekend looks sunny in Rehoboth Beach, with a chance of rain Sunday into Monday, Johnson and Carr said. Weekend weather is expected to be sunny and in the high 70s at the Delaware beaches.\n\n“I’d just say if people have outdoor plans this weekend, keep an eye on the forecast,” Johnson said on Tuesday. “It’s still far enough out that it could change.”\n\nMore about those beach cliffs\n\nA summer with nearly perfect, calm weather offered an opportunity for sand to build up on Delaware’s beaches, making cliffs seen along the coast earlier this week seem that much more dramatic.\n\n“I call them fat summer beaches,” said Powell, head of DNREC’s shoreline and waterway management section. “So then when you get a significant storm, it starts to chew away at that sand that accumulated all summer. The way it chews, it causes a cliff to form.”\n\nPowell said there’s nothing to be done about the cliffs when they appear, which have not cut into any of the dune systems that protect roads and buildings behind them — with the exception of the severely shrunken beach in Delaware Seashore State Park just to the north of Indian River Inlet.\n\nThat beach is expected to benefit from the future dredging of Massey’s Ditch in Rehoboth Bay later this year.\n\nAs for the mini cliffs along other portions of the coast, people need to watch their step. Most had already evened back out by Wednesday.\n\n“We certainly don’t go attempt to modify the scarps that form because they happen every year, typically every year for miles and miles of coastline,” Powell said. “It’s not practical. We hope beach patrols take the lead in the guarded beaches to make sure that people understand it could be a hazard.”\n\nPowell said those cliffs, or scarps, will not make the beaches — or the businesses, building and homes behind them — any more susceptible in the face of a huge storm.\n\nHurricane season is well underway, and Delaware generally sees impacts from tropical systems in September and October.\n\n“It’s more of an inconvenience than anything else,” he said. “We can have one big, major nor’easter like we had in January of 2016 — the one called Winter Storm Jonas — that is capable of completely changing our winter season and creating vulnerability in one big storm. This is nothing like that.”\n\nDelaware’s ocean beaches are regularly replenished with sand through a partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Sometimes Delaware Bay beaches also benefit from a partnership with the federal government. Emergency funding, like in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, is also a way officials can get the funding to rebuild the shore, which can cost millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nREBUILDING BEACHES:Delaware is bringing the missing beach back to these bay communities through replenishment\n\nThe next beach replenishment project is slated for later in 2019 or early 2020 in Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach, where crews are expected to add sand to strengthen the beach face.\n\nBethany, South Bethany and Fenwick Island were just replenished last year.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/04/12/april-plant-sales-house-tours-starting/100359856/", "title": "If it's April, plant sales, house tours are starting", "text": "Betsy Price\n\nThe News Journal\n\nHere come the plant sales, house tours and festivals celebrating spring and gardening:\n\nThrough April16: Tulip Celebration in Lewes.

His two sisters and younger brother scurry over to join him, plopping themselves down onto the carpeted floor.\n\n“I love you Daddy. I love you Mommy. I love you baby Cadence,” Tylier repeats, his eyes closed.\n\nJust feet away, their father, Terrance, sits alone at the kitchen table, legs outstretched surveying his children. The chair across from him sits empty. One by one, they glance upward toward the collage of photos on their living room wall.\n\nThough Carolyn Drew may not be with them, she is always there.\n\nLess than three months ago, Carolyn Drew — 35 weeks pregnant — went to St. Francis Hospital with stomach pain. The pain, which began overnight, left her writhing on the hospital bed and cool to the touch, nurses wrote in medical records.\n\nWithin two hours of arriving at the hospital, she was unresponsive. Hospital records say Carolyn lost the baby before she ever made it to St. Francis — and a uterine rupture caused her to hemorrhage from within.\n\nShe and her daughter, Cadence, died on the morning of March 20.\n\nA large, framed photo of her hangs in the shared children's bedroom, one of the few pieces of artwork that adorn the walls, save for a cartoon poster or two and a handmade watercolor painting by 6-year-old Taralyn.\n\nIt is the same photo that accompanied the 26-year-old woman’s obituary earlier this year.\n\n“That’s what hurts the most,” Terrance said. “We fought so hard to get where we at and now she can’t even enjoy it with me.”\n\nTears welled in the 32-year-old father's eyes, his voice growing thick.\n\n“I miss her a lot.”\n\nBoth Terrance and Carolyn struggled for years to give their children a better life than they knew. They wanted their children to grow up free from foster care and instability, trademarks of their own childhoods.\n\nTheir love story spanned eight years, a chance meeting that began in a friend’s apartment in Salisbury, Maryland, and left them inseparable ever since. From that moment, Terrance said, they were committed to a life that represented a version of family they endeavored to find.\n\nBut life comes with “struggles,” something Terrance and Carolyn knew well as they cycled through temporary homes and shelters, fighting to keep their family together despite life’s attempt to do otherwise.\n\nDespite hurdle after hurdle, the couple found a way to persevere, and as they did, their family grew. First Taralyn, then Tylier, then Cheefh, and then Cylance. Within the last year, life took them from Salisbury back up to Wilmington, where they planned to start anew.\n\nOn Halloween, the family of six moved into their Wilmington home with the help of the YWCA Delaware's Home-Life Management Center. The organization's family shelter program had given them enough time to get back on their feet and both Carolyn and Terrance were working.\n\nIn a few short months, they would welcome another person to their family — another baby girl.\n\nNow, the 32-year-old father of four is facing this battle alone — in desperate need of a daytime job that lets him spend evenings with his children; a washer and dryer for the insurmountable amount of clothes small children cycle through; and support for the tragic loss of his best friend.\n\n“I wanted to give them the life I didn’t get from my mother and my father,” Terrance said. “The life I had to get from someone else’s mother and father. I wanted to give my children a good life so they could say ‘Mommy and Daddy made sure we was OK. They took care of us.’”\n\nMissing moments\n\n“Dear Mommy.”\n\nTaralyn reads from a ripped out page of her notebook, black crayon scrawled among the lines.\n\n“I love you Mommy. I wish you was here with me. I wish you came to Field Day. I love you, Mommy. You the best.”\n\nNeatly, the 6-year-old folds the notebook paper and licks the edge, pressing it tightly along the fold. It’s a special note, Taralyn says, a secret letter to her Mommy.\n\nIt has been nearly three months since Taralyn said goodbye to her mother for the last time and headed off to school.\n\nOn that morning, Carolyn — who was transported to the hospital by ambulance — told hospital staff that she was experiencing abdominal pain and pressure, according to hospital records Terrance shared with The News Journal.\n\nLess than a month before, Carolyn had an appointment at St. Francis where she reported “intermittent abdominal pain” that had been ongoing for several weeks, records say. At the time, she told the hospital she had no prenatal care, but that she had no problems with her previous pregnancies.\n\nTerrance said their oldest child, Taralyn, was delivered by emergency Cesarean section due to preeclampsia, a dangerous condition characterized by high blood pressure, swelling of hands and feet, and protein in the urine. The succeeding three children were also delivered by C-section.\n\n“Everything was going normal,” Terrance said. “She was taking her vitamins like she was supposed to every morning.”\n\nOn March 20, nurses overseeing Carolyn in the emergency room were unable to find a heartbeat for her baby, and contractions weren’t apparent when nurses palpated her stomach, records say.\n\nShe didn’t want nurses drawing blood and refused to keep an IV in, according to hospital records. When staff stepped out of the room to call for a bedside ultrasound, Carolyn “reportedly turned on her side, placed (her) thumb in her mouth and appeared to go to sleep.”\n\nShe would not reawaken.\n\nDespite more than an hour of what hospital records describe as “critical care” — CPR, oxygen, and drug injections — Carolyn died at 9:46 a.m. She had only arrived at the hospital less than two hours prior.\n\n“I just don’t understand, you know,” Terrance said, his eyes welling with tears.\n\nSince Carolyn’s death, Terrance said many friends have reached out with similar stories — either children lost at childbirth or lost during the pregnancy. The topic isn’t talked about until tragedy hits, but in that silence sit decades of similar stories.\n\nAfrican-American women are nearly 3.5 times more likely to die due to pregnancy-related issues than white women, according to the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBACKGROUND:State fears there are more pregnancy-related deaths than have been reported\n\nIn 2016, 15 maternal mortality deaths were reported in Delaware. The numbers, which tripled from 2015, prompted Delaware state health officials to start monitoring these deaths to better understand the reasons behind them — and because these statistics may not encompass all the deaths.\n\nBut for families in the midst of tragedy, answers are few and lack much comfort.\n\n“Our plan was to live a good life,” Terrance said. “We got our house and we were going to get a vehicle and go places, go on our trips and take our children out. I haven’t been to Disney World or Orlando, Florida, Busch Gardens. I’ve never done the major things my friends did. … We wanted to show them a good life.”\n\n“We wanted them to enjoy life as children.”\n\n'Getting some help for us'\n\nGrief has a way of sneaking up on the Drews, though Carolyn is never far from sight or mind.\n\nEvery night, the family prays together in the children’s bedroom. They say goodnight to Mommy and to baby Cadence as they say their prayers.\n\nSome nights, though, are harder than others.\n\n“The other night, when I left them, I went to my room and sat down and I had my own moment,” Terrance recently recalled. “Taralyn heard me. She came down there and said ‘Daddy, it’s gonna be OK,’ and patted me on the back.”\n\nAt the age of 6, Taralyn already understands loss. She’s likely the only child to fully comprehend what it means to lose a parent, though it’s now a facet of life that all the Drews will carry with them.\n\n“I know they feel it. They take it out in their own way. They struggle,” Terrance said. “They have their moments. They break down … so it’s like, I do my best with it and everything. I talk to them. I let them know that y’all can talk to me. Daddy’s working on getting some help for us.”\n\nAnd help can show up in the strangest of ways.\n\nThe Drews met Morgan Spurrier at the Ministry of Caring’s Child Care Center on North Jackson Street, just a few blocks from their current home. The children began attending the day care for homeless and low-income families before they moved into their house so Carolyn and Terrance could find work.\n\nThat’s where Miss Morgan, as the children call her, fell in love.\n\nThe 22-year-old Maryland woman, who serves as a member of the Lutheran Volunteer Corps and lives in Wilmington, first got to know Cheefh in the 2- and 3-year-olds room at the day care. His smile and squeals found a way to her heart, a love that deepened even more when she met Mr. and Mrs. Drew during child pickup and drop-off.\n\n“I think being in the area that we are, and serving the populations that we’re serving at the child care center, it’s not uncommon for there to be all different caregivers, which is not necessarily bad,” Spurrier said. “But there’s a lot of instability around some of that, and so, they (Mr. and Mrs. Drew) just stuck together through it all.”\n\nThe parents’ love for their children was apparent, Spurrier said, and her own adoration for the four children only grew.\n\nBACKGROUND:The cost of having children weighs on families\n\nWhen she learned of the Drew family moving into her Hilltop neighborhood, she did what she would do in her own community: She piled up a warm plate of cookies, walked around the corner, and welcomed them home.\n\n“I was just really excited for them to be in their own space,” Spurrier said. “And I remember so clearly Mrs. Drew grabbing my hands so hard with tears in her eyes, telling me that I was their first guest in their home.”\n\nThe kids were just as excited, pulling her up the stairs to see their new room — a room she found relatively empty save for a blanket or two. Before long and with the help of City Church, which Spurrier attends, furniture and some of the basics found their way into the Drew home.\n\nQuickly, the Drews turned into Spurrier's Wilmington family, a relationship that she says arguably gave her back more than she could have ever given them.\n\nWhen Carolyn died, Spurrier was the driving force behind a GoFundMe fundraiser that collected nearly $5,500, money Terrance relied on to bury his wife and baby daughter. The funeral was held at the Congo Funeral Home in Wilmington nearly a month after she died.\n\nThe service was open-casket, Spurrier said, and baby Cadence lay tucked into her mother's arms.\n\n“They will definitely know they were loved,\" Spurrier said, her eyes welling with tears. \"Their dad will still embody that for the rest of time because they had something so special.\"\n\nSticking together\n\nBetween the hours of 4 p.m. and bedtime, the Drew house comes alive.\n\nRarely do the children fall silent, unless they’re popping chicken tenders and French fries into their mouths, quiet only until the next bite is swallowed.\n\nThe kids — ranging in age from 1 to 6 — stick together. When they’re not too busy stealing each other’s toys or snacks, they’re helping each other read and practice jumping on one foot. Like siblings, they fight, but with the same endearing love that leads them back to each other.\n\nAt the end of the day, they’re family. It’s what their parents always wanted, even if that life isn't always easy.\n\nBefore Terrance and Carolyn met, Terrance spent a year in prison at the age of 16 after he was convicted of second-degree assault in Somerset County.\n\nWith some help from uncles, he was able to finish his high school degree and go on to Delaware State University. College, however, proved difficult to navigate and before long, Terrance found himself out of college, away from the life he planned, and trying to find a job.\n\nCriminal records, however, make that difficult. Though most states forbid employers from discriminating against people with a prior criminal charge unless the charge pertains to the type of work they will be performing, many people with criminal records report difficulty in finding employment.\n\nCOURTS:State legislation strives to alleviate juvenile felony laws\n\nInstead, Terrance has spent much of his life in food service, working whatever hours he can get cooking and serving patrons in Maryland and Delaware. At times, it was difficult to keep food on the table. When they were expecting their first child, Terrance was charged with theft under $100 after stealing food from a grocery store because they had nothing to eat in their home.\n\n\"I wasn't going to let my pregnant wife and our child go hungry,\" he said. \"I knew it was wrong, but I did what I had to do.\"\n\nA judge allowed him to serve his sentence on work release, so he could continue to pay the rent for their family apartment and see his wife on lunch breaks.\n\nMost recently, Terrance worked at Checker’s, but has found it impossible to return to the overnight shift he used to work now that he’s serving as a single parent of four.\n\nTime with his kids is more important. But now he needs a new job.\n\nAnything to keep him home with his children when they need him. Anything to keep them in their new house together.\n\n'Is Mommy here with us?'\n\nSome weeks are harder than others.\n\nTylier’s fifth birthday on May 8 and Mother’s Day brought up many memories. Certain moments are bigger reminders of who is missing from the pictures.\n\nTerrance shoulders much of the grief for his family, unable to fully explain loss to children 6 years of age and younger. But they understand in their own way.\n\n“When I had the Field Day, it was so hard … because that’s something we were supposed to do together,” Terrance said. “And Taralyn, she asked me, she’s like ‘Daddy, is Mommy here with us?’”\n\n“And then the little girl asked her, ‘Where’s your mommy at?’ And she’s like, ‘Mommy died,’” Terrance recalled, tears rolling down his face. “I worry about her going through that. It’s hard, but we make it.”\n\nGRIEF: For these Wilmington-area moms, Mother's Day will never be the same\n\nInstead, family and friends make sure Taralyn’s hair is braided just so for school days and special events. Her dad promises that if she can’t talk to him about something, she will have someone to talk with.\n\nThe same goes for Tylier, Cheefh and Cylance, who don’t necessarily articulate loss in the same way but show it nonetheless.\n\nCheefh likes to be picked up and held high to “touch Mommy,” pressing his small hands against the printed photos hung above their living room television. The 3-year-old points to the ones where his smiling face can be seen, propped up on his mother’s lap, often among his siblings.\n\nTylier often leads the prayers before dinner, telling small memories as they pop into his brain. He waves at Mommy, too, pointing to the pictures as he runs by the wall, tearing up the stairs after his siblings.\n\n\"You see from the very beginning both Mr. and Mrs. Drew showing up, picking up their kids and dropping them off, and the love that they had for each other and for their children,\" Spurrier said. \"Despite what they didn't have material-wise, the love and support was just so clear. You could see it.\"\n\nHandmade Mother’s Day cards now hang alongside the new photos added to Carolyn's collage. The family celebrated her 27th birthday with her at All Saints Cemetery. Those days are especially hard.\n\n“We’re making it,” Terrance said recently. “Every day is a new day, but we’re making it.”\n\nBut Spurrier's time with the Drew family is drawing to a close. Her year in Wilmington will end next month when she heads off to graduate school at Towson University, and she worries often about the children saying goodbye to yet another person in their lives.\n\nShe hopes a community organization can support the Drews moving forward, from emergency babysitting needs to meal drop-offs to getting them the washer and dryer they need to keep clean clothes on four young children.\n\n\"Material things are good, but I hope that they're able to stay in the place they're in now, with a home,\" Spurrier said. \"You just need food, love and a home. The rest is extra.\"\n\nTerrance agrees, but he knows all too well the realities they face — and how quickly a family can find itself without a home. Four children often leave little time for him to deal with the indescribable grief of losing his best friend.\n\n\"I have my times where I want to cry all the time,\" Terrance said, \"but I can’t because I got my babies. ... It's just hard sometimes because I miss her a lot. We were together a long time.\"\n\nSo Terrance hides the sadness in his eyes when his children wave goodbye to Mommy before heading up the stairs to play. He holds them tight when they cry, knowing where their pain comes from. And the father shows his own emotions when he needs to, because he doesn't want it to build up and hurt even more.\n\nLove is what got them here, Terrance said, and that love is what he knows will carry them forward.\n\nThose close to the Drews see it, too. It's what pulled Spurrier into the strong family in the first place.\n\n\"I just want the best for them,\" Spurrier said. \"Love is the most important thing, and that's covered.\"\n\nHow to help\n\nIf you're interested in supporting the Drew family, donations can be made on the GoFundMe page, \"Drew Children Support Fund.\" The family used this page, which initially raised about $4,900, to help pay for Carolyn's funeral but the page is still active and accepting donations.\n\nSTORIES FROM WILMINGTON\n\nOne bullet: 6-year-old shot in Wilmington last year now paralyzed, brain-damaged, but home\n\nWilmington teachers get schooled on living in poverty during DSEA training exercise\n\nWilmington: Most dangerous place in America for youth\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

This a roundup of some their biggest bills and whether they succeeded or flopped.\n\nBills passed by the General Assembly have been signed into law by Gov. John Carney unless noted otherwise.

The budget was approved last week.\n\nPlease note that the following list is not exhaustive and that some bills have been left out for the sake of brevity. Legislation that affects more than just education, such as a bill establishing paid family leave, is not included.\n\nClick on any bill to read the full text and get more information.\n\nBills passed\n\nSchool safety: One bill, sponsored by Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, requires that all newly constructed and renovated schools include a secure entrance, ballistic resistant glass or other ballistic resistant materials in all areas used to screen visitors, a panic button or intruder alert system, and classroom doors that can be locked on the outside with a key or magnetic card locking system.\n\nAnother bill, sponsored by House Minority Leader Danny Short, R-Seaford, creates a $5 million fund that public school districts and charters can tap to make safety upgrades.\n\nSpecial education: A bill sponsored by Rep. Kim Williams, D-Newport, allows certain special education students to earn a \"Diploma of Alternate Achievement Standards\" instead of a \"certificate of performance.\" Families told the News Journal in January that letting this select group of students get diplomas can help build self-esteem and confidence, as well make it easier for them to get jobs.\n\nState Board of Education: A bill sponsored by Sen. Stephanie T. Bolden, D-Wilmington, establishes two, nonvoting seats on the State Board of Education for a former Delaware Teacher of the Year and an 11th- or 12th-grade student. Instead of nine voting members, there will be seven. The board will be required to rotate its meetings among all three counties and to hold a public comment period. This bill is awaiting action by Gov. Carney.\n\nSchool funding: A bill sponsored by Sen. David Sokola, D-Newark, increases transparency around school funding by creating a statewide approach for districts and charter school to report expenditures. In December, State Auditor Tom Wagner said it's next-to-impossible to tell how much money is being spent on students because districts often miscategorize or mislabel payments. This bill has not yet been signed.\n\nSuspending licenses: A bill sponsored by Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, will let the state Education Department immediately suspend educators' licenses if they are arrested or indicted by a grand jury for a violent felony, or where there is a clear and immediate danger to student safety or welfare. Currently, the education department cannot take away teachers' licenses unless they are fired or they resign/retire after official notice of allegations of a sexual offense against a child.\n\nSchool suspensions: A bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington East, seeks to draw attention to the types of discipline used in schools by capturing data about out-of-school suspensions and publishing it online. If the out-of-school suspension gap between racial subgroups is more than 20 percent or if the overall suspension rate is higher than 20 suspensions for 100 students, schools will be asked to submit a plan to the state Education Department for reducing them. This bill has not yet been signed by Gov. Carney.\n\nDelaware Autism Program: \"The Alex Eldreth Autism Education Law,\" sponsored by Jaques, expands the Delaware Autism Program, which currently operates out of only six school districts. In January, families told the News Journal that the bill would make it easier for school districts to serve students with autism locally, instead of busing them to the nearest DAP center. This bill has not yet been signed.\n\nInspire scholarship: A bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Bushweller, D-Dover, strengthens the Inspire Scholarship, which offers assistance for qualifying high school students to attend Delaware State University, by extending it from six continuous semesters to eight.\n\nSpecial ed scholarships: Another bill sponsored by Williams creates a scholarship program for students with intellectual disabilities who are interested in going to college or getting a post-secondary education. Not yet signed by Gov. Carney, it sets aside about $39,200 per year for 11 students.\n\nLoan repayment: A bill sponsored by David Bentz, D-Christiana, establishes a program to make loan payments — valued at up to $2,000 a year — on behalf of educators at high-needs schools and those teaching high-demand subject areas. This bill has not been signed yet.\n\nSchool board elections: Another bill sponsored by Williams mandates that the polls for school board elections open at 7 a.m. instead of 10 a.m. They will still close at 8 p.m. This bill is waiting to be signed but could help improve voter turnout, which was \"disappointingly low\" this year.\n\nHunting and drivers licenses: In the past, the DMV could suspend a student's driver's license if they were expelled, and the court could suspend a student's driving privileges or hunting licenses for truancy. Two bills currently awaiting the governor's signature would let students keep their licenses in both cases.\n\nStudents paid to substitute: A bill sponsored by Rep. Sean Matthews, D-Talleyville, lets juniors and seniors majoring in education at a Delaware college or university be paid $83 per day as substitute teachers.\n\nSupport professional of the year: Another bill sponsored by Jaques creates an Education Support Professional of the Year award program, similar to the Teacher of the Year program. Support professionals include paraprofessionals, food service workers, bus drivers, custodians, secretaries and more.\n\nBills defeated or now dead\n\nBasic special education: A bill sponsored by Rep. Kim Williams, D-Newport, would have provided state funding for basic special education in kindergarten through third grade. While the bill was not fully funded, the state's new budget does include $6.4 million to enhance special education in grades K-3 and hire 45 reading specialists in grades K-4.\n\nSchool choice: Yet another bill sponsored by Williams aimed to streamline the school choice process, making it easier and clearer for parents, guardians, and school administrators to navigate. Among other things, school districts and charter schools would have been required to use a standard online application tool and would have been prohibited from asking for information that does not directly pertain to an enrollment or program criterion.\n\nSchool board terms: Sponsored by Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, this bill would have changed the term for school board members from five years to four years.\n\nSmarter Balanced opt-out: A bill sponsored by Rep. John Kowalko, D-Newark, would have let parents/guardians opt their child out of annual Smarter Balanced assessments.\n\nMetal detectors: A bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington, would have set aside $10 million for schools to install metal detectors, to be used to screen all book bags, containers and packages brought inside the building.\n\nField trips: A bill sponsored by Rep. Sean Matthews, D-Talleyville, would have required the state provide $25 per student to high poverty schools to be used for the purpose of field trips.\n\nUnexcused absences: One bill, sponsored by Rep. Sean Matthews, D-Talleyville, would have required that schools hold conferences with the parents/guardians of students who have been absent from school for five days without being excused. Currently, schools are required to reach out to parents if a student is absent for 10 days.\n\nRaising school taxes: Yet another bill sponsored by Jaques would have let school boards raise taxes without a referendum, roughly in keeping with inflation or the consumer price index. It would not have applied to capital improvements or tuition programs.\n\nRecesses and lunch breaks: A bill sponsored by Rep. Melanie George Smith, D-Bear, would have entitled all public school students in kindergarten through eighth-grade to at least two recesses (to last 10 minutes or longer) and a 30-minute lunch break.\n\nCapping enrollment: A bill sponsored by Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, would have capped enrollment at Sussex County Vo-Tech High School at 1,250, but was stricken on June 30.\n\nLabor Day: A bill sponsored by Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, sought to start the school year before Labor Day but didn't get much traction.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/18/texas-23rd-district-el-paso-election-tony-gonzales-john-lira/69561642007/", "title": "Texas Congressional District 23: Meet the candidates", "text": "El Paso Times\n\nThe contest in Texas' U.S. Rep.

My mother remarried a very abusive man and that was the environment I grew up in as a young child. One night it was so bad that my mother woke me and my brother up in the middle of the night and hurried us into a taxi. Those taxi lights meant freedom. I had no idea where we were going but it wasn’t there and that’s all that mattered. We spent some time in a battered women’s shelter and shortly after I went to live withmy grandparents 40 miles outside Uvalde in Camp Wood, Texas. As a teenager I moved back to San Antonio, but nothing had really changed in that home environment so I got out of there. I’ve been on my own ever since I was 15 years old. It was tough going to high school while working 3 jobs just to pay the bills, but I’ve never been afraid of hard work.\n\nI ended up leaving high school early to join the Navy. I didn’t even know how to swim, but the Navy recruiter told me they had a program where I could enlist and finish my high school education so that’s what I did. I spent the next 20 years in the Navy on missions around the world, including five years in Iraq and Afghanistan. I retired from the Navy as a Master Chief – a feat that less than 1% of enlisted sailors achieve.\n\nShortly after I got out of the Navy I went to work as a fellow in Senator Marco Rubio’s officewhere I helped craft the VA Accountability Act .\n\nIn 2019, I had a routine surgery go horribly wrong. I flatlined. I spent the next 23 days in thehospital, but by the grace of God I was able to go home to my wife and kids. This was areminder of just how precious life is and I’m grateful for every day I have on this earth.\n\nHow do you earn a living? Do you plan to continue if elected?\n\nI serve TX-23 full-time and it is the honor of my lifetime to do so. Since being elected, I have visited all 29 counties multiple times and have traveled over 100,000 miles across the district.\n\nPlease describe your education. Where did you get your high school diploma? What higher education degrees and certificates have you earned from where?\n\nPrior to completing my high school education in the Navy, I attended Edison High School in San Antonio. I earned a graduate certificate from Georgetown University, a Master’s in International Relations from American Public University and am pursuing my Ph.D. in International Development with an emphasis on Security Studies and International Politics at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nWhat experiences in leadership do you have that qualify you for this position?\n\nI know what it’s like to be abandoned. For far too long, this district has been abandoned by Washington. That is no longer the case. I have secured $100 million in community project funding for TX-23. This doesn’t happen without knowing how to develop a plan and execute. That is exactly what I did as a Master Chief Petty Officer leading sailors in the Navy.\n\nHave you ever been arrested or charged with a crime? Have you ever had a civil judgment against you? Have you ever been in arrears on local, state or federal taxes? If so, please provide an explanation.\n\nNo.\n\nIf elected, would you have any potential conflicts of interest that you are aware of that would impair your ability to serve? Please explain what they are and how you would avoid the conflict.\n\nNo. I work for TX-23 and I will always fight to make sure the people of this district have a voiceat the table.\n\nJohn Lira - D\n\nPlease describe your personal and professional background.\n\nI was raised in a working-class household in San Antonio, TX. My parents worked every hour of overtime their employer allowed. We were far from rich but only a paycheck away from being broke.\n\nMy senior year of high school I made the most consequential decision of my life when I enlisted into the U.S Marine Corps. This planted a seed of service and launched a career that has spanned foreign battlefields and some of the highest levels of federal government.\n\nThe Marines trained me to be an intelligence analyst and I used my G.I. Bill to transition into a policy analyst so I could continue serving my country.\n\nI have been trusted to lead in combat, help manage national veteran transition programs, and develop national policies for the President and Congress.\n\nThese experiences have taught me how to weigh and analyze critical decisions carefully and the importance of relationships and communication.\n\nI am also a father and husband. My daughter is a senior in high school and my wife is a professor in higher education. I am a disabled veteran who uses the Department for Veterans Affairs services and I am a proud Texan who wants to see our neighbors and communities thrive.\n\nHow do you earn a living? Do you plan to continue if elected?\n\nI have been a full-time candidate since entering this race in May 2021. I rely on my disability compensation and some rental income for now.\n\nPlease describe your education. Where did you get your high school diploma? What higher education degrees and certificates have you earned from where?\n\nI graduated from East Central High School in Adkins, Texas, about 15 miles outside of San Antonio. I went on to serve the U.S. Marine Corps where I was trained in satellite communications and later as an intelligence analyst.\n\nI used my G.I. Bill to build my skills as an intelligence analyst and earned an Associate’s Degree in Paralegal studies from San Antonio College and a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Political Science from the Honors College at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nI earned a Master’s of Science degree in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University. In 2015, I earned a certificate in business administration from Georgetown University.\n\nWhat experiences in leadership do you have that qualify you for this position?\n\nLeadership requires an instinct toward action and the ability to motivate people to a common cause. My leadership training began on day one of Marine Corps boot camp. Over eleven years of military service, I achieved the rank of Sergeant and have led Marines in battle. As an Intelligence analyst, my job was to provide military leaders with information that would inform and improve their decision making.\n\nAfter returning to Texas from my second tour to Iraq, I wanted to continue serving my country and decided to use my G.I. Bill to build a skillset that would be valuable to decision makers in the federal government who were responsible for making decisions about war and the care of veterans.\n\nIn the federal government, I continued to advise senior leaders and helped manage national veterans transition programs at AmeriCorps and the U.S. Small Business Administration. I was later trusted to develop and author policy proposals and legislation for the President and Congress on a National Commission and on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the Marines, I gained the desire to lead at the forefront in the most challenging environments and to leave no one behind. My experience in problem-solving and relationship building sets me apart from the other candidates. I have worked with military Generals, Members of Congress, executives, Mayor's, and the public.\n\nHave you ever been arrested or charged with a crime? Have you ever had a civil judgment against you? Have you ever been in arrears on local, state or federal taxes? If so, please provide an explanation.\n\nNo, I have never been arrested or charged with a crime. Nor have I ever had a civil judgment against me. Additionally, I have never been arrears on local, state or federal texas.\n\nIf elected, would you have any potential conflicts of interest that you are aware of that would impair your ability to serve? Please explain what they are and how you would avoid the conflict.\n\nI have no such conflicts of interests that would impair my ability to serve.\n\nMore:A guide to voter rights in Texas. What you need to know before you cast a ballot\n\nIssue related questions\n\nTony Gonzales - R, Incumbent\n\nWhy are you running for this office?\n\nI served 20 years in the Navy and I love to fight. This district deserves a representative with a servant’s heart who will fight tooth and nail, who will show up in good times and bad, and deliver with action not just talk. That is exactly what I have done in my first term and that is what I will continue to do.\n\nWhy are you the best candidate for this office?\n\nTX-23’s story is my story. I grew up in both the urban area of San Antonio but also the rural towns of Camp Wood and Devine. This district has been abandoned by Washington. I know that feeling and it drives me every day to show up and make sure TX-23’s voice is heard.\n\nAny candidate running for any office can talk a big game, but talk is cheap. I’ve acted and I’ve delivered. I delivered over $100 million in community project funding to communities all across TX-23 – big and small. We have a lot of active duty military and a lot of veterans here. I know what they’re going through and helped secured investments to improve TX-23 military installations and also make sure veterans get every single resource they’ve earned.\n\nI’m the only candidate in the race who is willing to buck his party in the interest of TX-23. In the aftermath of the tragedy in Uvalde, I worked across the aisle to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Yes I received opposition from members of my own party, but what mattered most was delivering for the people of TX-23.\n\nI’m the only candidate in this race that has a plan to secure the border and fix our broken legal immigration system.\n\nI’m the only candidate in this race who has shown up time and again to all 29 counties.\n\nWhat are your top three priorities?\n\n(1) Secure the border(2) Get our economy back on track(3) Bring our federal taxpayer dollars home to TX-23\n\nInflation is a top issue with voters. How would you address the issue of families struggling with housing, health care and food?\n\nInflation is hurting millions of Texans, particularly the poor and the middle class. They are seeing their real wages decline, while their savings and retirement accounts get crushed.\n\nThis is especially true in many low-income communities across TX-23. Through my position on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, I have secured billions for initiatives such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Development Block Grant program and HOME Investment Partnerships to create affordable housing for low-income families.\n\nWe need to rein in the reckless spending that has been the main catalyst for inflation.\n\nWe also need to end the attacks on the Texas oil and gas industries. Texas has the best fossil fuel workers in the world and if the government gets out of their way then they will lead the way as prices come down at the pump and utility bills fall.\n\nAnother component is doing away with the provision in the Inflation Reduction Act that makes it more expensive to manufacture goods in the United States – this is bad for jobs and for prices. Furthermore, we need to ease particular regulations that are making it more expensive for producers and job creators to do what they do best.\n\nThe other component of this is to create economic opportunity right here in TX-23. I have done that in my first term by helping secure funding for medical facilities, higher education, and infrastructure.\n\nFinally, military installations in El Paso, Del Rio, and San Antonio are vital to the quality of life in TX-23. I have fought hard to strengthen these institutions.\n\nShould assault weapons be banned?\n\nAfter the tragedy in Uvalde, I was on the ground day after day doing whatever I could to bring healing to the community.\n\nI emerged from those experiences and conversations with a resolve to get something done.\n\nThat’s why I worked across the aisle to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Congress needs to focus on what has a chance of getting through the House, the Senate, and signed into law by the President.\n\nWhat’s your best idea for providing health coverage for more Americans?\n\nInvesting in rural health centers and telehealth services is vital to expanding access to care. I have secured funding in Congress to do both.\n\nThis district is home to a large number of veterans. I helped secure $150 million in funding to construct a new VA healthcare center in El Paso County.\n\nWe also need to place a greater emphasis on mental health. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act included billions in funding for mental health and I am focused on bringing those dollars home to Texas.\n\nWhat, if anything, should Congress do regarding health care for women now that the Supreme Court has struck down Roe v. Wade?\n\nThe Supreme Court decision sent the issue of abortion back to the states. It is up to the voters in each individual state on how they want to handle the issue moving forward.\n\nMany of the proposed solutions to migrant influxes at the Southwest border require congressional action. (a) What solutions do you propose to fix the nation's immigration system? (b) What will you do, specifically, to work with the other party to achieve compromise?\n\nI have authored multiple pieces of legislation to address the crisis at our southern border. This includes joining with Democrat Henry Cuellear (TX-28) to introduce the Bipartisan Border\n\nSolutions Act in the House, which has a companion bill in the Senate introduced by Senator Cornyn and Senator Sinema of Arizona.\n\nOne of the first places we should start is with adding more technology. The horrific incident in which over 50 migrants were found dead in the back of a truck in San Antonio – that was in TX-23. Technology could have prevented this tragic loss of life.\n\nWe also need to add more immigration judges so asylum cases can be adjudicated in days rather than years. Migrants who do not qualify for asylum should be returned to their country of origin. Furthermore, we have to get Border Patrol agents out of the processing centers and back into the field where they can focus on securing the border instead of doing paperwork.\n\nI speak with farmers, ranchers, and business owners across TX-23 constantly. So many are in need of workers. Congress must come together in a bipartisan way to allow for an increase in work visas.\n\nI am the only candidate in this race with plans to fix the problems at our southern border.\n\nBecause of that I am endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council.\n\nWhat actions, if any, should Congress take to address the impacts of climate change in the Southwest and Texas, including extreme heat, forest fires and flash floods?\n\nThe recent drought in West Texas has made things tough on farmers and ranchers. In my first term in Congress, I have worked tirelessly to ensure our agriculture community has what it needs to be successful. It’s why I’m endorsed by the Texas Farm Bureau AGFUND as well as the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association PAC.\n\nThrough my position on the House Appropriations committee, I have secured millions of dollars for carbon management/storage and carbon dioxide removal initiatives through the Department of Energy. I have also helped secure key funding for rural water and wastewater management through the Environmental Protection Agency. I also helped secure funding for a $1.2 billion initiative through the Department of Transportation to engage in a Carbon Reduction and Congestion Management Program. I helped secure funding for the Island Main Lateral ConcreteLining Project in El Paso as well as the Riverside Canal Concrete Lining Project in El Paso.\n\nBoth of these investments would direct more water to agricultural land.\n\nCongress can help ensure local governments are prepared when natural disasters hit their communities. One way to do this is by passing my legislation the Providing Our Law Enforcement with Adequate Resources for Response Act. This bill would make it easier for cities to purchase equipment, like all-terrain vehicles, at a significant discount to assist indisaster recovery.\n\nWhat does transparent government mean to you? Will you be personally accessible to answer questions while in office?\n\nA transparent government is one in which citizens have confidence that the government is working on their behalf.I work for the people of TX-23. Serving them is the honor of my lifetime.\n\nBeing accessible to my constituents is a top priority. I have traveled more than 100,000 miles throughout this district since being elected listening to constituents, answering their questions, and explaining my votes. It is something I am proud to have done and something that will always remain important to me.\n\nJohn Lira - D\n\nWhy are you running for this office?\n\nI am running because our current Representative is not rising to the challenge to be the leader we need in this important district. I am ready to build partnerships and unify our district around smart and health growth in our communities.\n\nI am running because I feel our Constitutional Democracy is at risk of being hijacked by a party that will govern with anger, assertiveness, and aggression. I am running to move our country and our people forward and to challenge those who want to move us backward. Much is at stake and must support real patriots who will stand up for our Democracy. I am ready to protect our Democracy.\n\nWhy are you the best candidate for this office?\n\nWhile other candidates have served in the federal government, none have helped manage national programs, written national policies and legislation, or engaged with the public as I have. I am prepared to take immediate action on day one.\n\nI am the best candidate because I value relationships and have taken the time and put forth the effort to build relationships throughout the district. I have met with county judges, Mayor's, commissioners, and council members about the needs of the community.\n\nTexas-23 is big and showing up matters. I have proven through my Boots on the Ground Tour that I will show up and be accessible to all communities in this vast district.\n\nI am the best candidate because I will prioritize our district over partisan politics. My agenda will focus on expanding rural healthcare and economies, stabilizing our border, and making our communities safer from gun violence.\n\nWhat are your top three priorities?\n\nMy 3 top priorities include reducing inflation and the rising costs of goods and energy for families. I also want to lead on immigration, asylum, and border reform legislation that promotes bipartisan solutions to the multitude of issues at play at our southern border with Mexico. Finally, I will prioritize increasing access to medical professionals and facilities in rural communities. Too many town in Texas-23 are in healthcare deserts. I would like the first bill thatI introduce to be a gun safety bill for the parents of Uvalde.\n\nInflation is a top issue with voters. How would you address the issue of families struggling with housing, health care and food?\n\nWe need to bring manufacturing back to America and reinvigorate the American farmer. This will strengthen our supply chains and reduce costs across the board. We need a diverse and robust energy policy that reduces the cost of oil which drives up the cost of everything. We must revive our workforce and ensure critical Jon's are being filled. In Texas-23 there is a labor shortage that can be solved by opening up more temporary work visa permits. Congress must extend the emergency Medicare coverage provided during COVID-19.\n\nShould assault weapons be banned?\n\nI support Americans' 2nd Amendment to bear arms and I believe we must do all we can to prevent people who intend to harm themselves or others from attaining one over the counter.\n\nI understand Texas' unique history with firearms and the existence of a gun culture that precedes Texas' joining of the union. But, for a long period of time, Texas had some of the strictest gun laws in the country.\n\nAllowing anyone to buy a semiautomatic, high velocity, high capacity weapon means allowing everyone to overpower and overwhelm our law enforcement officers who we have charged to protect society.\n\nThese weapons were designed so U.S. troops could fire more accurately and at a faster rate than the enemy in battle.\n\nIf an assault weapons ban bill came to a vote, I would strongly consider voting for it. At the minimum, AR-15’s should not be sold to children below the age of 21 and adults who do not have enhanced background checks, training, and licensing.\n\nWhat’s your best idea for providing health coverage for more Americans?\n\nA universal public health insurance option that allows individuals to opt out if they want to be covered by private insurance. Additionally, the Texas Legislature's passing of Medicare expansion would have a tremendous impact on healthcare coverage in Texas.\n\nWhat, if anything, should Congress do regarding health care for women now that the Supreme Courthas struck down Roe v. Wade?\n\nCongress can vote to codify Roe v Wade into federal law and give women the choice to make their own health care decisions. In Congress, I would support the Women's Health Protection Act that protects women's privacy and reproductive freedom.\n\nMany of the proposed solutions to migrant influxes at the Southwest border require congressional action. (a) What solutions do you propose to fix the nation’s immigration system?\n\nOur Nation's asylum laws are outdated and must be amended to address the realities of today. While I will never understand what makes a parent take this perilous journey with their children, it shows that the United States is still a beacon of opportunity and inspiration for foreigners.\n\nOur legal pathways to immigration are broken and accessible to many immigrants. Less legal options for legal immigration leads to more illegal migration which is a lose-lose for all in the long run.\n\nCongress must invest in orderly and streamlined asylum hearing processes that can quickly determine if the individuals or families qualify for asylum. We need more refugee processing centers, including exploring the option of in-country processing centers, and supporting our U.S. Border Patrol agents in the field.\n\nMigrants should be part of our economic recovery. Asylum-seekers that do not qualify should be allowed to apply for an H-2A temporary work visa to assist with filling critical labor shortages that could help kickstart our rural economies.\n\nWe should invest in our ports of entry to allow for increases in the flow of commerce between Mexico and the U.S., while having more advanced tools to combat narcotics and human trafficking.\n\nAll these important issues must be addressed immediately. It is up to Congress to act and I will lead at the forefront of these important negotiations.\n\n(b) What will you do, specifically, to work with the other party to achieve compromise\n\n● Invest in refugee processing centers so border patrol can be deployed to the field rather than in processing centers.● Expand temporary work visas for migrant labor in much needed industries like ranching and farming. Migrants should be helping rebuild rural America.● Invest in border security including anti-drug and human smuggling assets.● Ensure those who do not qualify are immediately returned to their country of origin or allowed to apply for a temporary work visa.● Ensure Mexico is included in the conversation and part of the solution.\n\nWhat actions, if any, should Congress take to address the impacts of climate change in the Southwest and Texas, including extreme heat, forest fires and flash floods?\n\nSouthwest Texas is getting hotter and drier every year. Our vast landscape makes us home to a very unique environment which propels our energy and agriculture industries. I support investments that make vulnerable communities and industries more resilient and capable of withstanding extreme conditions.\n\nAddressing climate change in southwest Texas means advancing our oil, wind, and solar energy processes so they are safer, cleaner, and more efficient. It also means protecting and preserving our local natural resources to ensure our farms and ranches are sustainable.\n\nI want Texas-23 to lead the nation in energy production. I support continued investment in renewable energy and to fund more intensive carbon capture programs.\n\nI believe we are responsible for leaving a healthier planet to our children and grandchildren and I will support legislation in Congress that does just that.\n\nWhat does transparent government mean to you? Will you be personally accessible to answer questions while in office?\n\nTransparency means making understanding the government simple for people to understand.\n\nU.S. Representatives should inform people in DC about what's happening in the district and inform people in the district what's going on in DC. Transparency means communicating with constituents on my votes and how they will affect our communities. Transparency means accessibility and accountability. Most importantly, transparency means showing up and being present for the people you represent.\n\nOnce elected, I will hold in-person, public town hall meetings throughout the 23rd district, unlike our current congressman. I will share statements after important votes so the people of Texas-23 understand why I voted how I did. I will employ district staff from our communities to provide excellent constituent services for their neighbors. Transparency comes with clear lines of communication and strong relationships. I will continue to work to build upon the relationships I have throughout the vast district.\n\nFrank Lopez Jr. - I\n\nFrank Lopez Jr. did not respond to the El Paso Times questionnaire.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/24/liquid-oozes-onto-highway-red-squirrels-rising-floods-oysters-exploding-atm-news-around-states/40882385/", "title": "50 States roundup", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: It’s unknown when a popular north Alabama state park that was hit by a tornado on Dec. 14 will be fully reopened. The lodge, marina and some other sections of Joe Wheeler State Park are operating following the strike by what forecasters determined was an EF-1 twister. But the campground and day-use areas were badly damaged, and park officials said clearing away fallen trees and other debris will take time. The park is on the Tennessee River at Rogersville. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nWillow: At least six homes were evacuated after an ice jam caused a creek to flood in a subdivision north of Anchorage, emergency officials said. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Department of Emergency Services responded to flooding reports in Willow around 11 p.m. Saturday, The Anchorage Daily News reported.No injuries were reported. Residents near the Willow Creek and Deneki Road areas were evacuated late Saturday and early Sunday. A large chunk of ice jammed at the Deneki bridge and restricted water flow, which caused upstream flooding, a National Weather Service flood advisory said. The American Red Cross opened a temporary shelter at the Willow Community Center, although some residents chose to remain in their homes, officials said. The Willow Fire Department, Alaska State Troopers and Mat-Su Water Rescue Team responded to provide assistance in the community about 70 miles north of Anchorage, the borough said. The water began to recede Sunday, but a layer of ice formed and cars were frozen in place.\n\nArizona\n\nSafford: After a devastating 2017 wildfire nearly wiped the species out, the Mount Graham red squirrel, the nation’s rarest small mammal, continues its slow climb out of the danger zone. The annual survey of the bushy-tailed rodents found at least 78 squirrels living on the upper slopes of Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona, a 4% increase from 2018. The survey was conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Coronado National Forest, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Center for Nature Conservation at the Phoenix Zoo, and the University of Arizona. Although the species’ growth this year was much smaller than the 91% rise noted in the year after the 2017 Frye Fire, biologists are still encouraged that the half-pound critters are on the comeback. But a report released Nov. 18 suggests that the tiny mammal – which has survived fire, construction, introduced competitors and drought – faces a foe that could finally do it in: climate change. The report in the journal Nature Climate Change found that virtually all the of country’s 459 endangered species, including the red squirrels, have at least some vulnerabilities to long-term alterations like drought, increasingly intense storms and temperature rise.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter Regional Medical Center officially broke ground Wednesday on the hospital’s outpatient surgery center. The 23,000 square-foot facility, which will be located along Beard Drive southeast of the hospital, is estimated to cost $8.7 million and should be completed in early 2021. The hospital presently performs close to 8,000 surgeries a year, medial center CEO Ron Peterson said, with about 65% percent of those outpatient procedures. The hospital expects the outpatient surgery center to perform about 3,000 procedures in its first year of operation, and it has the capacity to perform about 7,000 a year at full capacity.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A shark reportedly bit a surfer Saturday afternoon off Southern California in a “truly terrifying situation,” the Coast Guard said. The 37-year-old man had been surfing near Santa Rosa Island, one of the Channel Islands, during the attack, according to a news release. A friend aboard a nearby boat applied a tourniquet to his leg and called the Coast Guard for help, the release stated. A helicopter crew flew the man to the Santa Barbara airport for treatment and he was in stable condition Saturday night. Coast Guard video footage posted on Twitter showed the man, wearing a full-body wetsuit, being hoisted up from the boat into the helicopter. “This was the best possible outcome to a truly terrifying situation,” Coast Guard Lt. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said in the release.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city’s water utility said it will speed up the removal of lead pipes from homes across the metro area. Denver Water said it expects the program to launch in 2020 and take 15 years at a cost of $500 million, Colorado Public Radio reported. The public agency estimated there are between 64,000 and 84,000 lead service lines in the system. Denver Water said it committed to removing at least 4,500 lines annually under an agreement with the EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Lead exposure can lead to kidney and brain damage, as well as developmental issues for children. Homes built before 1951 are more likely to have lead service lines, Denver Water said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A police officer grabbed onto a driverless SUV that had rolled into traffic and stopped it from potentially hitting a group of children, authorities said. Surveillance video posted online by news outlets showed Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. running toward the moving vehicle and using his body to slow and stop the car. A group of Harding High School school students was walking on the sidewalk near the path of the SUV. There were two passengers in the car – one in the passenger seat and one in back – but no driver, when it somehow slipped out of park and rolled away, officials said. It had been parked on the street on a downward slope. Carmo was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, authorities said. No other injuries were reported. Mayor Joe Ganim said Carmo will be honored for his actions.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: Two weekend events recently brought a group of Satanists and hundreds of Christian worshippers together in the middle of town. Hundreds of people attended a live nativity Saturday night in Georgetown, while a group of Satanists held a quiet vigil nearby, The News Journal reported. The Satanist organizers said their vigil marked the winter solstice and celebrated religious diversity and equal rights during the holiday season. The group describes itself as a “nontheistic Delaware-based modern Satanic group.” A group called the Good Ole Boy Foundation is sponsoring the nativity scene each night until Christmas. “Everybody has the right to celebrate whatever they celebrate,” Georgetown resident Katie Rohlfing told the newspaper.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Advocates for homeless people marched through the streets of the nation’s capital with an empty coffin as part of an annual vigil to the honor those who have died. City data showed at least 117 homeless people have died in the district this year, The Washington Post reported. Data showed about 52 of the deaths were considered accidents, including 44 that involved intoxication and three that involved the person being hit by a car. Of the remaining deaths, 26 causes were still pending, two were suicides, eight were homicides and 27 were considered natural, including several that involved alcoholism or cardiovascular disease. The seventh annual vigil hosted by the People for Fairness Coalition opened late Thursday with attendees singing hymns in front of the coffin at a local church before carrying it to Freedom Plaza. After the overnight vigil, participants attended a ceremony at another church where the names of those who died were read aloud.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Sheriff’s deputies were searching for a suspect who they believe exploded an ATM in an unsuccessful effort to steal money. In a news release, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reported that an ATM exploded early Sunday just after surveillance cameras caught the male suspect spray-painting the exterior cameras black at the Pilot Bank. The Tampa Bay Times reported the suspect was unable to get through the ATM’s internal safe so no money was taken. Authorities said a similar incident took place at another bank in nearby Oldsmar in November.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service plans to place a more storm-resistant roof on a historic building that serves as its staff headquarters at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast. The building wasn’t an original part of the Civil War-era fort east of Savannah. It was constructed just before World War I as an attendant’s quarters for a nearby quarantine station. The station was used to treat people with highly contagious diseases between 1889 and 1937. The park service is seeking public comment on its plan to replace the existing asphalt shingle roof with one made of steel, the agency said in a news release. The current roof suffered damaged from Hurricanes Matthew and Irma in 2016 and 2017. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the last surviving building associated with the former quarantine station. The park service said Georgia’s state historic preservation office determined a steel roof would adversely affect the building’s historic character because it would lack the appearance of the original shingle roof. The park service said it plans to minimize the new roof’s impact by applying steel in a diamond shingle pattern that mimics the original design.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: New U.S. Navy contracting terms have resulted in a pullout by a major contractor that is expected to result in the loss of hundreds of jobs at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, officials said. BAE Systems PLC will no longer perform Navy surface ship repair at Pearl Harbor, eliminating about 325 jobs, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms for maintenance on nonnuclear surface ships. The multinational security, aerospace and ship repair firm was the prime contractor for repair projects through which subcontractor surface ship work was funneled. BAE announced a five-year multiship, multioption contract in 2014 for modernization and maintenance on nine destroyers and cruisers at Pearl Harbor. But multiship, multioption contracts using cost-reimbursement have been replaced nationally by a Navy strategy called “multiple award contract-multi order,” officials said. The new system uses firm-fixed-price contracts that do no allow adjustments for cost overruns, officials said. BAE cannot bid on smaller, $1 million to $2 million contracts under the new Navy format, but can seek major ship projects that can be $50 million to $100 million, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: A state Supreme Court ruling has upheld a lower-court decision regarding ownership of a launch on Lake Coeur d’Alene. The Dec. 11 ruling said the Eastside Highway District does not own a park boat launch in Coeur d’Alene’s Boothe Park, The Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The highway district had appealed a decision establishing a boundary on the park’s east side. The case has led to a debate over who can access the boat launch and whether the district and the public are allowed lake access at the park, district administrators said. The state Supreme Court affirmed the lower-court decision that Gregory and Ellen Delavan own the launch. The court found that any boundary agreement between the couple and the highway district no longer exists, regardless of whether an agreement existed between the district and previous property owners. The Supreme Court also ruled the summary judgment granted to the Delavans by the district court must be readdressed. The park was established around 1955 when it was conveyed to the Coeur d’Alene Highway District, the precursor to the Eastside Highway District.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: New HIV diagnoses in Chicago continue to go down and have declined for four consecutive years, according to figures released by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city’s health department. The 734 new diagnoses reported in 2018 among Chicago residents are the lowest number since 1988, health officials said Monday. Chicago Department of Public Health’s 2019 HIV/STI surveillance report showed 23,580 people were living with HIV through the end of 2017, the year for which most current data is available. The health department’s HIV Services Portfolio is awarding more than $40 million annually to more than 60 community-based and health care organizations. Although HIV rates are declining in Chicago, other sexually transmitted infections are rising. More than 30,600 cases of chlamydia, nearly 12,700 cases of gonorrhea and 877 primary and secondary cases of syphilis were reported to the health department in 2018.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers:A 4-year-old girl who sledded Saturday onto a frozen pond that was rapidly melting was rescued by firefighters as the ice began to crack while they pulled her to safety. The incident happened at 10 a.m. Saturday in the girl’s backyard, according to a post on the fire department’s Facebook page. The sled was parked near the house but the snowy backyard led directly to the retention pond on a downward slope. Firefighters said the child hopped on the sled before the parents could react, and it carried her onto the pond. The ice did not crack and the parents did not try to walk out to the sled, which firefighters said was the right thing to do because the ice was brittle. Instead, they called 911 and waited for the fire department. The rescuers arrived quickly as the child waited on the sled, according to the post. They used equipment to scoot onto the ice and grab the girl. As they did, firefighters heard the cracking but “luck held that the ice could support the weight,” according to the Facebook post. Officials with the fire department could not be reached immediately for comment but they warned on Facebook that ice-covered ponds will continue to melt this week as temperatures remain above average.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Twice within an hour on the afternoon of Dec. 9, police said a Des Moines woman intentionally struck young pedestrians with her SUV, later telling authorities that she targeted a teenage girl because she was Latino. The other victim is a black male. Nicole Marie Poole Franklin, 42, is accused of hitting a 12-year-old boy with her SUV as he walked on a sidewalk within an apartment complex property in the 6000 block of Creston Avenue in Des Moines. Franklin is charged with attempted murder in the incident, which occurred at 3:54 p.m. on Dec. 9, according to a news release from Des Moines police. Witnesses told police the SUV accelerated before striking the boy, who suffered minor injuries. About 30 minutes later, Clive police said Franklin drove off the roadway and struck 14-year-old Natalia Miranda as she walked on a sidewalk along Indian Hills Drive. Franklin faces an attempted murder charge in the hit-and-run. Clive Police Chief Michael Venema said Franklin told police that she targeted Miranda because the girl \"is Mexican.\" Miranda suffered several injuries but returned to school less than a week after the incident. She told KCCI after the crash that she remembers the vehicle coming toward her, but doesn't recall being hit. About an hour after Miranda was hit, West Des Moines police were called to a Conoco gas station where Franklin allegedly stole merchandise and referred to employees and customers by racial and ethnic slurs. West Des Moines police on Sunday said Franklin would face a felony hate crime charge – assault in violation of individual rights – for the Conoco incident, on top of previous charges of theft and public intoxication.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has an extra $75 in its coffers because of a former thief with a guilty conscious. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported that someone anonymously sent the money to Shawnee County along with a letter dated Dec. 18. The letter stated that the sender is in a 12-step program and working to make financial amends. It stated that many years ago, the writer stole a receptacle meant for cigarette ashes that was in front of the courthouse. County Commission Chairman Bill Riphahn said the letter was accompanied by three $20 bills, a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Police collected more than 236 tons of food for Kentucky families with the 10th annual “Cram the Cruiser” food drive. Post 16 in Owensboro collected the most this year with a total of 60,925 pounds of food. Post commander Capt. Brenton Ford credited Master Trooper Corey King for organizing the drive and also recognized the support of local people and businesses, a state police news release said. State police initiated the program in 2010 to help families in need in local post and region areas. Since then, the agency has contributed nearly 2 million pounds of food to shelters, food banks and churches around the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: At least one bald eagle, and possibly a second, might have been killed in northwest Louisiana, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Agents believed it happened in the Lake Claiborne area, though they don’t think it was in the state park there, enforcement division spokesman Adam Einck said in an email Monday to the Associated Press. Einck said he couldn’t provide any details because agents are still investigating. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The number of bald eagle nests being used for eggs and nestlings fell to at most seven in the early 1970s. A survey in southeast Louisiana, where the birds are most numerous, found 264 active nests in 2018.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine lobstering group has promised to fight the approval of an oyster farm off the state’s southern coast that has become part of a protracted fight over access to the water. The Maine Department of Marine Resources approved a lease of about 35 acres on Maquoit Bay on Dec. 19 for the Mere Point Oyster Company. The state uses a leasing system to allow people raising seafood to use state-owned waters to grow shellfish such as oysters and mussels. Many Maine lobster fishermen opposed the application because they fear it will take away their access to the bay bottom, where they trap lobsters. Some have also said the project is symptomatic of an aquaculture industry they think is growing too fast for the state and will make it difficult to catch Maine’s signature seafood. Opponents of the project are filing an appeal in court to attempt to stop it. Representatives for the Mere Point Oyster Company did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nRidge: The state’s first formal stock assessment supported claims by environmentalists that oyster numbers have experienced a sharp decline in the Chesapeake Bay – down 50% since 1999. The study estimated market-size oysters dropped from 600 million in 1999 to about 300 million in the Maryland portion of the bay in 2018. The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborated in the study at the request of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources after the state legislature mandated it. Oysters play an important role in the bay’s ecosystem because of their water-filtering capabilities. They also create reefs for habitat for other bay life. DNR chief Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio said the stock assessment provides “the best available science” to move forward. She also said the state’s oyster management plan has been updated, with the goal of creating a sustainable oyster fishery in eight to 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge is hearing arguments in a case challenging how Massachusetts prisons treat inmates with opioid addiction. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts is seeking a temporary restraining order compelling the state Department of Correction to provide three prisoners their prescribed medication for opioid addiction while they serve out their sentences. The ACLU and the law firm Goodwin Procter filed suit Friday alleging that the three inmates had been prescribed addiction treatment medication before being incarcerated but were told by prison officials that they would only receive them for up to 90 days, after which they would be withdrawn. The organizations argue the policy violates the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act’s protections for people suffering from opioid addiction. The organizations said the inmates are effectively being forced to go through painful withdrawal and face an increased risk of relapse, overdose, and death without their medication. The Correction Department has said it doesn’t have a policy restricting the dosage or length of treatment for opioid addiction medications. It said any decisions about maintaining or discontinuing medications are made by the company it contracts for inmate health care service.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights:The state said there is no immediate health threat as crews continue to clean up a greenish-yellow chemical ooze that ran onto I-696 in Madison Heights on Friday, apparently seeping from a nearby chemical plating plant that was closed three years ago. The underground plume is not impacting air quality or the drinking water, Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy said Sunday. The contaminated water is migrating underground and working its way to the freeway, she said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is working with the state, determined the liquid likely was groundwater contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Samples results from the site are expected this week, Greenberg said. The spill has been traced to a nearby, closed electro-plating company in Madison Heights whose owner was convicted of storing dangerous chemicals in leaky containers. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical Pacific Gas and Electric Company was accused of contaminating the drinking water in a California town in the famous lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMillerville: Authorities said two brothers are dead after being overcome by fumes in a grain silo on a western Minnesota farm. The Star Tribune reported the victims were identified as 47-year-old Curt F. Boesl and 49-year-old Steven T. Boesl. Authorities said an 11-year-old son of Curt Boesl’s, Alex, also fell ill to the fumes late Saturday morning and was taken by air ambulance to a Twin Cities hospital. His condition has not been released. Authorities said Boesl and his son were working in the top of the silo and “were apparently overcome by fumes.” Another son outside the silo saw what happened and called 911. He also called his uncle, Steven, who arrived and went to the top of the silo to try and rescue his brother and nephew. Authorities said Steven Boesl also was apparently overcome by fumes. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed them from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died Sunday morning.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Average wait times have tripled at Mississippi’s driver’s license stations over the past two years, according to a report by a state legislative watchdog agency. The Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review report released Dec. 18 attributed the spike in waits to reasons including vacancies, malfunctioning kiosks and clients being provided outdated or inaccurate or incomplete information. Other reasons include the adoption of a computer system that the report said increased processing times for routine transactions by 40% to 50%, news outlets reported. The state Department of Public Safety is working to lessen wait times, the report said. Changes include implementing appointment scheduling, filling vacant positions and improving online services, the report and Public Service Commissioner Marshall Fisher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Clair: Authorities said two boys have died after plunging through a frozen pond near their home in eastern Missouri. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said the 7- and 8-year-old boys were found Sunday afternoon in the private pond in Franklin County. The search began after the boys didn’t return from a bicycle ride. The patrol said a family member found one of them floating in the pond. A diver then located the second child. The report didn’t say how long they had been in the water. They were pronounced dead several hours later. Their names weren’t immediately released.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: US officials transferred 33 disease-free bison from Yellowstone National Park to a Montana Indian Reservation as part of efforts to reduce the slaughter of bison that migrate out of the park. Robert Magnan with the Fort Peck Tribes said a trailer carrying the animals left the park Monday morning. It was expected to arrive at the reservation in northeastern Montana later in the day. The animals were to be released into a pasture on Tuesday. The shipment includes bison and their descendants who were trapped to prevent the spread of the disease brucellosis. They have been tested repeatedly to make sure they are disease-free. Brucellosis can cause pregnant animals to prematurely abort their young. It has been eradicated in the U.S. except for the Yellowstone area, where it persists in herds of elk and bison. Yellowstone has captured thousands of bison and sent them to slaughter for disease control over the past few decades. Monday’s transfer was done under a program that puts some captured animals through a quarantine to make sure they do not carry brucellosis. The quarantine program has been in place for more than a decade, but struggled in its early years in part because of opposition from the livestock industry due to worries about cows becoming infected.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prison officials have canceled Christmas Eve visits to the Nebraska State Penitentiary to fight a prison system flu outbreak. Nearly four dozen flu cases have been confirmed and a higher number are suspected at five prison facilities, the Department of Correctional Services said in a new release Sunday. The penitentiary in Lincoln has the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases, said prisons director Scott Frakes. The department is taking several steps to help stop the outbreak, including providing face masks for staffers and inmates and encouraging inmates to get flu shots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:State water officials want to pause the approval of groundwater for new developments in Cold Spring Valley north of Reno, which has seen thousands of new homes in recent decades. They want to know more about the sustainability of the valley’s groundwater supply before signing off on new projects. On Friday, state engineer Tim Wilson, Nevada's highest-ranking water official, signed an order declaring a moratorium on approving new subdivision maps if the development would rely on groundwater pumped from the Cold Spring Valley. The order makes exceptions for developments that would import water via pipeline, such as the proposed 5,000-unit Stonegate development. Pumping to support existing homes in the valley isn't affected by the order. Wilson and his boss, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Director Bradley Crowell, are concerned the amount of water rights approved exceed the rate at which nature replenishes the underground aquifer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers will be considering two bills to crack down on vaping this session. Last session, the Legislature added vaping to state’s tobacco laws and raised the minimum age for cigarettes and vaping products to 19. Next year, lawmakers will consider a bill to go even further and raise the minimum age for vaping to 21. Lawmakers also will take up a bill that would ban all flavored vaping products except for menthol. Democratic Rep. Jerry Knirk told New Hampshire Public Radio that he believes it’s a public health issue and that lawmakers should be doing everything they can to stop teens from vaping. But Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said he would not support banning sales of any vaping products.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township:About 200 people rallied Saturday for Stephanie Parze, a 25-year-old missing Freehold Township woman, an effort by her family to keep a light burning for her. The group stood outlined in yellow police tape shaped into a heart as a tower ladder from the East Freehold Fire Company hoisted photographers over the crowd. Parze was last heard from on Oct. 30 after a night out with family. Her on-again, off-again boyfriend, John D. Ozbilgen, 29, was named by police as a person of interest. He took his own life on Nov. 22, hanging himself in the garage of his parents’ Freehold Township home. That was two days after he was released from Monmouth County Jail, where he was held for 11 days on a child pornography charge that resulted from a review of his cellphone in connection with Parze’s disappearance. Suspicion hung over Ozbligen up to his death. He was accused of choking and beating other women and posting Facebook messages and sending texts that alluded to abuse, violence and homicide. Parze’s father, Ed, said the outpouring of support has been surprising. One woman delivered 21 baskets of gifts worth thousands of dollars that she collected from neighbors to be auctioned off at a fundraiser. The family is continuing to schedule searches and fundraising events. A search will be staged at 9 a.m. Sunday at 333 Route 522 in Manalapan.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: President Donald Trump signed legislation Friday that extends federal grant programs aimed at preserving indigenous languages and expands eligibility so more tribes can participate. The legislation was named after Esther Martinez, a traditional storyteller and Tewa language advocate from northern New Mexico’s Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo who died in 2006. Her family, tribal leaders and members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said reauthorization of the programs through 2024 marks a commitment by the federal government to keeping Alaska Native and American Indian languages alive. Dozens of tribes from Alaska to Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Massachusetts have benefited from the programs over the years. There are more than 40 active grants totaling more than $11 million that are being used for language preservation and immersion efforts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The most popular baby names in New York City last year were Liam and Emma, according to data released by city health officials Monday. Of the babies born in New York City in 2018, there were 779 Liams and 501 Emmas, according to the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s birth certificate records. The number of births in the city decreased from 117,013 in 2017 to 114,296 in 2018, according to the city’s data. Liam has been the top name for boys since 2016, and Emma has been the top name for girls since 2017. Some New Yorkers opted for rarer names: There were a handful of girls named Aminah, Ida and Zadie and boys called Bentley, Lucian and Warren. Nine of the top 10 boy names from 2017 remained on the list in 2018. Jayden was dropped from the 2018 list while Alexander was added as the 10th-most popular name. Eight of the top girl names stayed on the top 10 list for 2018. Amelia and Chloe joined the list as the ninth- and 10th-most popular names in 2018 respectively.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWaynesville: Authorities said a man impersonating a police officer pulled a woman over and told her to get out of her car at gunpoint. The man is still at large. The Haywood County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that the incident happened Sunday. The sheriff’s office said the man was driving a silver Dodge Charger with dark-tinted windows and white strobe lights. The woman thought it was a police vehicle and pulled over. The sheriff’s office said the man wore a black button up collared shirt, cargo pants and silver badge. He also had a gun on his belt. Authorities said the man pulled out his gun and told the woman to “get out of the car.” The woman drove off only for the man to briefly chase her in his car.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landslide closed a road in the Bismarck area, but authorities said no one was injured. A driver called authorities Sunday afternoon about the impassable River Road. It wasn’t immediately known what caused the landslide that blocked both lanes of traffic. Burleigh County highway department engineers were assessing the situation and how best to reopen the road.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Aerospace fans who have trouble fitting a museum visit into daytime hours will have the opportunity next year to make evening visits to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The extended schedule once a month will give busy families and other people with time crunches more options to see and experience the museum’s exhibits, museum officials said. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but will remain open until 8 p.m. on the first Thursday of each month beginning next year. Visitors on select evenings will get up-close looks at different vintage aircraft in the museum’s collection with volunteer experts on hand to discuss and answer questions. The museum near Dayton plays host to some 800,000 visitors a year who can see more than 350 aerospace vehicles and thousands of artifacts. It also shows movies and offers simulators and other attractions. Admissions and parking are free.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: An iconic building in downtown Tulsa that was once the world headquarters for televangelist Oral Roberts’ ministries is losing its distinctive diamond-shaped facade for safety reasons. The Tulsa World reported workers are removing the diamond-shaped slabs of granite that cover the Abundant Life Building, The building was originally constructed in 1958 but has been vacant since the 1980s. Its ownership has changed hands several times over the years. It’s now owned by Sharp Development. Brian Elliott, with Sharp Development, on Friday said several of the diamonds have fallen on their own. Preservation Oklahoma chose the windowless structure as one of 2016’s most endangered historic places. Preservationists said the building exemplifies at-risk midcentury architecture and is woven into the fabric of Tulsa’s past. The building had been subject to several nuisance violations between 2004 and 2014. A trespasser died in 2013 after falling down an elevator shaft.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A group of homeless people followed up on a plan to set up tents on the state Capitol grounds Monday after being displaced from downtown under a camping ban passed by the City Council earlier this month. About 25 people with about a dozen tents occupied the park before State Police and Parks and Recreation Department officials arrived. State officials and Salem Housing Authority staff told the homeless they had two hours to leave the Oregon Capitol State Park. At least one camper was arrested on an outstanding warrant. City officials briefly revisited an idea to allow sanctioned tent camping Friday, but they have backed away from that proposal. Instead, they are redoubling efforts to find a space to operate a 90-day warming shelter after Salem First Presbyterian Church decided not to participate.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGladwyne: Joseph Segel, a “quintessential entrepreneur” who founded the home-shopping network QVC, has died, the company that owns the channel announced. He was 88. Segel died Saturday in Gladwyne because of congestive heart failure, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. He was remembered as an innovator for creating QVC, short for “Quality Value Convenience.” It launched in 1986 and was played by nearly 60 cable stations. It now reaches 380 million homes throughout the world, according to a press release from Qurate Retail Group. In 1993, Segel retired as chairman of QVC. He stayed on as a company adviser until 2013. Segel’s entrepreneurial streak wasn’t just limited to QVC. He also founded the Franklin Mint, a private mint company that produces commemorative coins and other collectibles. It is now owned by Sequential Brands Group.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: State environmental officials have cited two people and are looking for four others they said were deer hunting out of season over the weekend. Environmental officers responded to Burrillville on Sunday after getting reports of out-of-season hunters, according to Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management posts on social media. The first officer on the scene made contact with two people they described as poachers, but four others fled into the woods. A department dog was brought to the scene and found three shotguns hidden under the snow and leaves. One was still loaded. A fourth hidden shotgun was located by officers searching another area of the woods. No names were released.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: Nearly 1,200 city employees are getting early Christmas presents in the form of January pay raises. The Spartanburg Herald-Journal reported that the County Council recently adopted the county’s first pay restructuring in more than a decade, which includes $5.3 million in annual pay increases and benefits for jobs in 27 pay grades ranging from $23,500 to $167,710. The increases will affect 1,183 employees. The Council had budgeted for 4% increases. Some will get more, and others will get less. County Administrator Cole Alverson said tax revenue is greater than expected, and all the raises can be paid for without a tax increase. The raises take effect Jan. 3, and will be seen in the Jan. 23 paychecks, he said. Designed to attract and retain employees, council members said they hope the raises make up for several lean budget years of no or little pay increases.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Two South Dakota companies have paid off all lunch debt in the Pierre School District. Karber Construction and American Trust Insurance have eliminated a negative balance of about $2,300 in students’ meal accounts. Mandy Karber said that as a small business, they were looking for a way to give back. She said it’s typical of the community where there are a lot of people willing to help out, according to the Argus Leader. American Trust Insurance said it raised about $1,000 with an employee-giving campaign. District business manager Darla Mayer said school officials are grateful for the generous individuals and businesses.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Two American originals, Elvis Presley and David Lynch, will converge when Graceland plays host to a fan convention celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Twin Peaks.” The gathering – officially known as “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” – is set for April 3-5, with most events at the Elvis Presley’s Memphis entertainment complex across the street from the mansion. According to Graceland, the convention will include “‘Twin Peaks’-themed parties; exhibits of props and costumes; screenings of fan-favorite episodes; and autograph and meet-and-greet sessions “accompanied by cherry pie and ‘damn good coffee,’” according to a press release citing the culinary preferences of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, the series hero played by Kyle MacLachlan. Celebrity guests who are scheduled to attend include Sherilyn Fenn, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Chrysta Bell, Michael Horse, James Marshall, Kimmy Robertson and Sheryl Lee. Lynch, the celebrated director who created the cult series with writer Mark Frost, is not scheduled to attend. Ticket packages for the “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” go on sale at 2 p.m. Thursday at www.graceland.com/TwinPeaks. Tickets initially will be offered in expensive “packages,” ranging from $399 to $999; one-day tickets and other types of admission are expected to be made available at a later date.\n\nTexas\n\nKaty: A dispute over a child’s haircut ended with gunfire Saturday at a barbershop, according to authorities. Deputies are looking for a man who shot an employee of a barbershop in the Houston suburb of Katy during an argument, the Harris County Sheriff’s office said in a tweet Saturday. Witnesses said the argument was over a haircut given to the man’s son. The alleged shooter left the barbershop in a grey, four-door sedan, according to the sheriff’s office. The employee was shot three times and was in stable condition at an area hospital, KPRC-TV reported Saturday. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for information Sunday.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials are considering whether to allow a highway to be built through protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, a plan that has drawn criticism from conservationists. The proposed four-lane highway would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area north of St. George to connect traffic from Washington City to St. George, the Spectrum newspaper reported. The Bureau of Land Management is taking public comments through Jan. 6 ahead of a draft environmental impact statement that’s expected to come out late spring or early summer. Elected officials in southern Utah have been pushing for the road to address current and future traffic concerns in one of the most rapidly growing parts of the country. Conservationists argue that officials should consider alternatives to a highway that could put the threatened tortoise and other sensitive species at risk.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: Three school districts will soon be using electric buses to carry some of their students to and from school. The Barre Unified School District, Champlain Valley School District and Franklin West Supervisory District will each replace a regular bus as part of an electric bus pilot program. The districts were chosen from a long list of applicants to participate in the program funded by Vermont’s legal settlement with Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act, MyChamplainValley.com reported. Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Emily Boedecker said it’s an opportunity to check the benefits of electric transport on a small scale. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation are working together on the program. Over the next few months the districts will be working with the sponsors to purchase the buses, build charging infrastructure, and look at any other facility upgrades that might be needed.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday that he hired Melissa Baker to oversee 38 state parks and more than 270 employees. She will be the first woman to run the department in the park system’s 83-year history when she starts in January. Baker previously worked as the director of North Dakota Parks and Recreation Department and previously worked as chief of operations for Montana State Parks. She previously taught at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and the University of Maine.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Health officials are warning people to stay away from area beaches and bodies of water as the region’s record-breaking rainstorms have caused sewage spills. Medina Park Beach along Lake Washington, Saltwater State Park in Des Moines and Port Washington Narrows in Kitsap County were hit by sewage overflows caused by a 48-hour storm system that soaked the region. The heavy rainstorm began Thursday, dropping more than 6 inches of rain before easing up Saturday. Friday was the wettest day in Seattle in 10 years, and the most rain for Dec. 20 since record-keeping at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport began in 1945. The National Weather Service said the airport recorded 3.25 inches of rain Friday, making it also the fifth-rainiest day in city history. Seattle also broke a daily rainfall record on Thursday with 2.91 inches, making it the 11th-wettest day recorded at the airport. King County said the Medina Pump Station was fully functioning when it overflowed on Friday for about four hours. Advisory signs have been posted. Officials said coming into contact with fecal contaminated waters can cause gastroenteritis, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections, and other waterborne illnesses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who want to recycle their Christmas trees after the holidays will be able to donate them to be used for fish habitats. The recycling event is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Jan. 4 at Charleston’s Capitol Market. There’s no limit to the number of trees each person can donate and no size limit. Trees must be real. All decorations must be removed, and branches must be attached to the tree. The trees will be repurposed as fish habitats in lakes across West Virginia, including Cheat, Tygart, Stonewall Jackson, Stonecoal, Burnsville, Sutton, Summersville, Big Ditch, Sherwood, R.D. Baily, Beech Fork and East Lynn lakes, and the Apple Grove Hatchery in Mason County. The program is sponsored by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan in conjunction with West Virginia State Parks and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. Staff will be at the donation site to help unload trees. Those who donate can register for prizes, and each person who donates will receive a gift from the Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: For decades, those who have participated in snowball fights in Wausau have risked getting in trouble with the law. But that might be about to change. A 1962 ban on throwing projectiles in Wausau lumps snowballs into the same category as rocks and other items that can cause serious harm. City Council President Lisa Rasmussen said that recent negative national attention over the rarely used ordinance has raised questions about whether it could be time to take snowballs off the naughty list. Wausau police and the mayor even made a video showing officers having a snowball fight. The City Council will consider decriminalizing snowball fights at a meeting next month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The city plans to continue using police sharpshooters to reduce its deer population. A Wyoming Game and Fish Department permit allows the city to cull as many as 50 deer per year. A recent count showed 180 deer in the city limits, down from 192 in 2018 and nearly 300 in 2015, the Cody Enterprise reported. A task force in 2015 recommended reducing the deer population to 150. Police sharpshooters have killed 151 deer since the local program began. Allowing the herd to grow would cause the deer to have insufficient food and become unhealthy, Police Chief Chuck Baker said. The Police Department provides the deer to people willing to process and eat the meat.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/12/08/pensacola-naval-air-station-shooting-saudi-national-likely-to-increase-tensions-us-saudi-alliance/4366465002/", "title": "Pensacola shooting by Saudi national likely to strain US-Saudi ties", "text": "WASHINGTON – The shooting by a Saudi military trainee at a Pensacola naval base, which left three people dead and eight more wounded, is likely to further damage America's already fraught relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday that he spoke with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, \"who expressed his condolences and sadness at the loss of life in the horrific attack.\"\n\nBut condolences may not be enough as the FBI investigates the shooter's motivations, including allegations that he posted anti-American sentiments on social media before the rampage.\n\nThe FBI identified the shooter as Mohammed Alshamrani.

What’s up with THAT?\" David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist and commentator, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nEven before Friday's attack, lawmakers in both parties were outraged by Khashoggi's gruesome killing and Saudi Arabia's conduct in the Yemen war, which has killed thousands of Yemenis and created one of the world's worst humanitarian catastrophes.\n\nTamara Cofman Wittes, a former State Department official for near eastern affairs, said the Pensacola shooting will be \"layered on top\" of other damaging Saudi actions in recent years, including the torture and trials of women's rights activists in the kingdom.\n\nThose incidents \"have all broken trust between Riyadh and its patrons in Washington – especially but not exclusively on Capitol Hill,\" Wittes wrote in an assessment of the shooting on U.S.-Saudi relations. Her take was paired with Byman's.\n\n\"This horrific attack in Florida will remind Americans that the kingdom – while reforming in some significant ways – remains rooted in an extreme religious-political ideology,\" Wittes said.\n\n\"We don’t yet know the full story of what motivated this Saudi officer to open fire on his classmates in Pensacola,\" Wittes added. \"But the event instantly challenges those, whether in the Trump administration or in the private sector, who have been seeking to brush aside concerns about the kingdom’s trajectory. It will sharpen questions on Capitol Hill about why the United States government is training Saudi pilots whose bombing raids harm civilians in Yemen.\"\n\nContributing: Doug Stanglin, Annie Blanks", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/28/underwater-art-tomato-fight-lawn-mower-racing-news-around-states/39520639/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state House of Representatives has passed legislation allowing residents to purchase wine and have it shipped directly to their house. The bill by Republican Rep. Terri Collins would allow licensed wine manufacturers to obtain a permit to deliver limited quantities of wine directly to Alabamians. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board doesn’t allow such shipments now. The bill passed 77-11 and now heads to the Senate. Democratic Rep. Thomas Jackson jokingly shouted during Thursday’s debate, “What’s wrong with the wine we got now?” – a reference to former Rep. Alvin Holmes, who famously asked in a 2008 debate about allowing stronger beer: “What’s wrong with the beer we got? I mean the beer we got drank pretty good, don’t it?”\n\nAlaska\n\nAkiak: The community has quickly lost entire buildings due to erosion along the banks of its river, officials say. Residents of this southwest Alaska town awoke last week to find that smokehouses built along the Kuskokwim River had fallen into the water along with stretches of the riverbank, KYUK-AM reports. The community 42 miles northeast of Bethel lost between 75 and 100 feet of the riverbank, according to Akiak City Administrator David Gilila. “That’s just in one day; that’s just in a matter of hours,” Gilila says. Akiak has experienced erosion problems before but now faces damage to about a mile of riverbank. “There’s no comparison to it,” Gilila says. “Before, it was just certain spots. Today, it’s the whole bank from the upper end of Akiak to the lower end of it.” Houses now face possible destruction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican-led Legislature has proved receptive in recent years to certain proposals offered up by teenagers, passing laws to designate lemonade as the state drink and copper as the state metal. But some students who went to the Capitol this year say they got a different type of reception – if they got one at all – when they tried to pitch proposals on meatier public-policy topics. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that those topics include gun control, school safety and climate change. While GOP legislators said refusing to sponsor progressive bills doesn’t amount to disrespect, some teenage policy advocates said some lawmakers were condescending at times but gushed about the civic involvement of young people who pushed innocuous bills sponsored by Republicans.\n\nArkansas\n\nHope: The publisher of the largest newspaper in the state has said by the end of the year, the publication will no longer print or deliver daily editions and will instead distribute iPads for subscribers to access a daily digital replica. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette will still print a Sunday edition but will urge subscribers to convert to the daily digital replica, accessible via the newspaper’s app. The newspaper’s publisher, Walter Hussman, has said that if 70% of subscribers convert to the digital version, the paper will be profitable for the first time since 2017. Some subscribers who converted say they prefer the digital paper, which can be enlarged and which is easily transportable. But it remains to be seen if the program will also appeal to younger generations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Massive crowds are expected at Disneyland when its Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge land opens this week, but park officials have a plan to manage them – and it involves Stormtroopers. Park employees dressed as the white-armored foot soldiers may be used to encourage guests to “move along” to other parts of the theme park if they’ve overstayed a four-hour limit inside Galaxy’s Edge. The time limit will be in place from the area’s opening Friday until June 23. Reservations and a special wristband are required to visit the area at the Anaheim theme park for the first three weeks. Galaxy’s Edge is the largest single-theme land created inside a Disney park. The 14-acre land’s marquee attraction is a ride inside a replica of the Millennium Falcon.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: The state has a new law on the books that legislators say expands protections for mobile home residents and leads to better enforcement of those regulations. The Daily Camera reports Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law Thursday that sets up a resolution process for disputes between mobile home residents and park owners. The law allows the state Division of Housing to accept complaints and begin the mediation process. The law also gives residents 30 days to leave properties when evicted, instead of the previous 48 hours. Democratic state Rep. Edie Hooton says the state will likely see a spike in complaints during the law’s first year, but lawmakers expect the volume to subside as “park owners start to see that the rules are being enforced.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: Police are still searching for a fugitive who failed to honor an agreement and surrender once enough people responded to his wanted poster on social media. Jose Simms is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. He is believed to be in New York state. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page last week that Simms had contacted him through the site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster received 15,000 likes. The page has far surpassed that number, but still no sign of Simms. Maki Haberfeld, an expert in police ethics and procedure at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says Simms is using social media to manipulate the news media and police, who she said have no business negotiating a deal with a suspect, never mind one that involves likes on Facebook.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A church has been badly damaged by a fire, though no injuries have been reported. The blaze engulfed Saint Mary’s Holy Church near Georgetown on Sunday. State investigators are trying to determine the cause of the destructive blaze. Delaware’s office of the state fire marshal says the “heavy damage” at the church was estimated at $50,000. The Georgetown Fire Company responded to the early Sunday blaze. It was first reported shortly after midnight.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory welcomed parishioners to his first Sunday Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Matthew the Apostle over the weekend, WUSA-TV reports. D.C.’s newest archbishop officially took possession of the cathedral during the Mass, welcomed by Monsignor Ronald James in a celebration of the beginning of the new ministry. Gregory expressed his joy, saying, “We are beginning something new – a new friendship and relationship that we pray will be fruitful and filled with joy.” He then asked the parishioners for their faith and prayers. Following the Mass, Gregory introduced himself, shaking hands and talking with the Catholic parishioners he will serve in his new position. He was formally installed last Tuesday as the first African American leader of the district’s Catholic community.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Divers off the state’s far southern coast can now visit an underwater art museum. Divers finished placing a series of artworks on a sunken ship Saturday about 7 miles south of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The project consists of 24 large photo illustrations created by Austrian artist Andreas Franke. They were placed on the Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a former U.S. Air Force missile tracking ship that was intentionally sunk 10 years ago to create an artificial reef. Franke calls it the “Plastic Ocean Project” and says he wants it to draw attention to the need to eliminate plastics in the world’s oceans. On Monday, divers unfurled a giant American flag on the 523-foot long ship to commemorate Memorial Day and the 10th anniversary of the ship’s sinking.\n\nGeorgia\n\nValdosta: A civil rights activist is clashing with the mayor over a proposal to rename a street for former President Barack Obama. The Valdosta Daily Times reports police escorted the Rev. Floyd Rose, 80, from a city council meeting Thursday after Mayor John Gayle said he kept talking beyond his public comment time. Rose wants Forrest Street renamed to honor the nation’s first black president. He says it was named in 1883 for Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Ku Klux Klan leader. Gayle said petitioners need to follow a new ordinance, but Rose said it was designed to thwart the name change. It says only one signature can come from each parcel along a road, so multiple signatures from a single apartment complex don’t count.\n\nHawaii\n\nKeauhou: Federal officials are in the final review stages for rules that would ban swimming with Hawaiian spinner dolphins. West Hawaii Today reported last week that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials are nearing completion of regulations proposed almost three years ago that would create a 50-yard barrier around the mammals. Officials say the rules would outlaw coming within the protected area around Hawaiian spinner dolphins – or “naia” in the Hawaiian language – by any means including swimming or using a boat to intercept the animal’s path. The prohibition would cover all persons, vessels and objects and extend 2 nautical miles from island coastlines, including waters bounded by Maui, Lanai and Kahoolawe. The regulations would include exceptions such as dolphins approaching swimmers and boats and safe navigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nMeridian: Federal data shows the state’s largest cities have grown larger, with a second city now seeing its population topping 100,000 residents. The Post Register reports new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau show the most dramatic growth was in this city neighboring the capital, Boise. Meridian’s population has jumped nearly 39% since 2010, with a population estimated at nearly 107,000. The data indicates Meridian grew the seventh fastest of the major cities across the country. Meridian is now second to Boise, which recorded a population of nearly 229,000 residents last year. Behind Meridian is Nampa with 96,000 people and Idaho Falls with 61,000.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers has sent Congress a $778 million plan to fortify a waterway in the state with noisemakers, electric cables and other devices in the hope that they will prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, where the aggressive invaders could leave other fish with too little to eat. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite on Thursday approved the plan to install defenses at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam near Joliet, about 40 miles from Lake Michigan. The site is a crucial choke point in an aquatic pathway between the lake and the carp-infested Illinois River. Although only a few live Asian carp have been found past the barrier, the fish’s DNA has turned up there as recently as April, when water samples were taken from Chicago’s Lake Calumet.\n\nIndiana\n\nClarksville: A former Colgate-Palmolive factory could become the home of a hotel, housing and commercial space. The factory in this Ohio River town in southern Indiana made toothpaste and other personal hygiene products for decades until it closed in 2007. A plan recently approved by Clarksville officials and the Clark’s Landing development group calls for redeveloping the building, which is known for its large, iconic clock. Clarksville redevelopment director Dylan Fisher tells the News and Tribune the project is expected to include a hotel, multifamily housing, commercial space and a civic center. That proposal is part of a redevelopment planned for Clarksville’s south side. It will have elevated bike trails, a revamped riverfront area, and a mix of businesses, residential spaces and community spaces.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has vetoed a bill that would have lifted a cap on the potency of medical marijuana products available in the state. Reynolds vetoed the bill Friday afternoon, saying the state must proceed cautiously in any expansion of its medical marijuana program. Reynolds says she could support in the future a more limited effort to increase the potency of products. Democratic lawmakers who have supported expansion of the program criticized Reynolds’ decision, saying it would hurt sick people who get little benefit from products now available that have low levels of THC, the compound that causes a high. Rep. John Forbes, an Urbandale pharmacist, called the veto “distressing news for thousands of sick and vulnerable Iowans who deserve greater access to this life-changing medication.” The bill had been approved overwhelmingly in both legislative chambers.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Restored mission control consoles used by NASA to guide trips to the moon will soon be shipped from the state to the control room where they were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. The Hutchinson News reports that Cosmosphere’s SpaceWorks experts have restored 19 consoles in Hutchinson over the past year and a half. NASA picked up 10 of the consoles last year, and the remainder will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday. The consoles, which will be unveiled in June ahead of the 50-year anniversary celebration of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon, were used for the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. They also helped communicate with astronauts to fix an oxygen tank that exploded on Apollo 13.\n\nKentucky\n\nWilliamstown: In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of the Noah’s ark attraction in the state are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1million in property damage. The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The attraction’s insurance carriers refused to cover the damage. The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged. The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers. Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn’t responded in court filings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMetairie: A young bald eagle found soaked and stumping along a street in the neighborhood where it hatched will be released Tuesday in the same area. A resident brought the mottled brown eaglet to the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine’s Wildlife Hospital on May 11, after making sure it needed help. Another neighbor has been collecting money for its care and posting health updates outside her home. Coastal consultant and photographer P.J. Hahn says it was on the ground, barely able to fly, and appeared to have a wing injury. Veterinary school spokeswoman Ginger Guttner says the eagle needed supportive care and has been in the school’s flight cage since May 20 so veterinarians could be sure it flies well enough to be released.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: Local Memorial Day celebrations have noted the absence of a particularly prominent veteran who died last year. The American Legion had two empty chairs in Kennebunkport’s Dock Square on Monday in memory of all of the times former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched the Memorial Day parade from that spot. Mark Matthews from American Legion Post 159 said organizers wanted to acknowledge the absence of Bush, a longtime summer resident and a Navy veteran. He missed last year’s parade after falling ill after attending an American Legion pancake breakfast earlier in the weekend. He died at age 94 on Nov. 30, months after his wife’s death. Town Manager Laurie Smith said the Bushes’ absence is felt every day. She said it will be a “strange” summer without their presence.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: To Marylanders, Old Bay is more than a seasoning – it’s a symbol of state pride. The yellow and blue tin with a red lid is tattooed on calves or placed in windowsills along with a crab and decorative mallets. A T-shirt proclaims: “I put Old Bay on my Old Bay.” Eighty-three percent of the state’s residents reported a favorable opinion of Old Bay, according to The Goucher Poll, a political survey of 808 adults. Yet the seasoning’s popularity belies a little-known truth: Cooks in restaurants and crab shacks rarely use Old Bay to steam crabs. The Baltimore Sun called dozens of crab houses in the region, and the majority – 18 out of 30 – said they steam crabs with either J.O. No. 2 seasoning or a custom blend made by the Halethorpe-based spice company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities say a group of Jewish teens played a key role in saving the life of a drowning man with a tattoo of a swastika. NBC Boston reports it happened Thursday night as the four youths – all students at an Orthodox Jewish high school in suburban Brookline – spotted the body of a man partially submerged in Chestnut Hill Reservoir. Boston College police officer Carl Mascioli says two of the teens ran to his patrol car to alert him. Mascioli says he rushed down the embankment, pulled the man from the water and noticed the Nazi symbol tattooed on his hand. He says the unidentified students told him they don’t regret helping the man despite his anti-Semitic tattoo. Officials say the man is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Pvt. James Robinson played an important role in the final battle of the Revolutionary War, but like many African Americans who took up arms against the British, he received little lasting recognition. That’s about to change. Members of two patriotic lineage societies linked to historic wars are planning to unveil a special grave marker and give Robinson, who died in 1868, military funeral honors during a ceremony next month at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. “Over 5,000 African Americans served in the Revolutionary War, and Robinson is one of the most consequential figures of the period,” said Elijah Shalis, secretary of the Michigan Society Sons of the American Revolution. “He deserved this honor 151 years ago.” Robinson led a remarkable life. He was a slave and a minister who fought in two wars and died at age 115 as the last known living African American veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCook: A woman in northern Minnesota has donated a kidney to a volunteer firefighter who was the first responder when she and her child needed help. KARE-TV reports that their paths first crossed in 2016 when Becca Bundy’s 1-year-old daughter was having a seizure. She dialed 911, and Bearville volunteer firefighter Bill Cox was the first on the scene. Last fall, Bundy came across Cox tending bar and wearing a T-shirt that said he was in end-stage kidney failure and needed a donor. Bundy was a match, and the transplant took place in February. The 66-year-old Cox, who is now free from dialysis, says Bundy is his angel. She says she feels blessed to be on his journey with him.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a state law that would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, at about six weeks of pregnancy. “Here we go again,” U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves wrote in his order. “Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.” His new order stops the law from taking effect July 1. Reeves is the same judge who struck down a 2018 Mississippi law to ban abortion at 15 weeks. The Magnolia State is one of several states that have pushed this year to enact bans on early abortions. Opponents of abortion are emboldened by new conservative Supreme Court justices and are looking for ways to challenge the court’s 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state has become the 20th to join a nationwide sex offender registry. OffenderWatch said in a news release last week that every Missouri law enforcement agency that manages or investigates registered sex offenders will be able to collaborate on offender records, aid each other in investigations and share notifications with the public. It won a five-year contract from the Missouri Highway Patrol. Missouri has about 16,000 registered sex offenders. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children says there are more than 900,000 registered sex offenders in the United States. OffenderWatch says its service allows different law enforcement agencies to collaborate on a single offender record, improving accuracy and aiding in public safety. Its technology is used by more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies in 37 states.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state will install a permanent monument on the Capitol grounds recognizing Native American contributions to the state and nation. Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday held a ceremonial signing of legislation to erect a monument and display the flags of the state’s eight recognized Native American tribes. The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Marvin Weatherwax of Browning, called it a big honor and “well overdue.” Bullock says the monument will be a symbol of respect and understanding, as well as a recognition that the Capitol belongs to everybody. The measure was part of a package of bills Bullock signed dealing with Native American issues, including legislation meant to improve the response to reports of missing American Indian women.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: It’s not very often you get to touch a dinosaur. But that’s just one of the many cool things about the newly renovated Schramm Education Center at Schramm Park State Recreation Area near Gretna, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The pallid sturgeon touch tank lets kids feel the unique fish, which outdoor education specialist Amber Schiltz says is like a living dinosaur. That fish family has been around for 70 million years. School kids who recently visited loved to touch the bony plates of sturgeon when a curious one swam up to their hands. “They were squealing and getting excited,” Schiltz told the paper. “It was really fun.” The center will soon hold its grand opening after an almost two-year renovation that cost several million dollars, much of it funded by donors. The building, previously called Aksarben Aquarium, was gutted and expanded by about a third.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe’s clarity rebounded last year from its worst level in a half-century of record-keeping as weather and streamflow returned to more normal conditions. Scientists at the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center say the dinner plate-sized disc used to measure clarity was visible at an average depth of 70.9 feet in 2018. That’s 10.5 feet better than the year before. The new clarity measurement is in line with the five-year average of 70.3 feet, which is an increase of nearly a foot from the previous five-year running average at the alpine lake that straddles the California-Nevada line. Scientists hope efforts to combat threats to lake clarity posed by development and climate change will eventually return the lake to its historic clarity level in excess of 100 feet.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIsles of Shoals: The state has had an artist in residence at the White Mountain National Forest for years. Now it will have one at an island off its coast. The nonprofit Star Island Corporation is launching a weeklong Artist-in-Residence program. Star Island is one of a group of small islands among the Isles of Shoals, an hour’s boat ride from the New Hampshire and Maine coasts. A formal application process is being worked on for the program for next summer. For centuries, the Shoals have attracted artists drawn to the rugged beauty of the islands. The residency will require artists to share their time and talent with conference guests, day visitors and staff of Star Island. Exhibit space for artwork will be provided in the lobby of the 19th-century Oceanic Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Deptford: The largest U.S. seller of San Marzano tomatoes, known to food lovers as the best tomatoes to make pasta sauce, has been hit with two federal lawsuits claiming what’s inside the can isn’t the real thing. New Jersey-based Cento Fine Foods called the claims “wrongful” last week and assured the company’s tomatoes are true San Marzanos, meaning they were grown at the base of Mount Vesuvius in Campania in Italy. One suit filed in February alleges fraud, saying there’s no way Cento can produce that many San Marzano tomatoes. Another suit says the cans lack certain labeling that qualifies them as true San Marzanos. The company says that isn’t a requirement. San Marzano tomatoes are a favorite among foodies for their sweet flavor, stronger taste and low acidity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: John Pinto, a Navajo Code Talker in World War II who became one of the nation’s longest-serving Native American elected officials, has died at age 94. State Senate colleague Michael Padilla confirmed Pinto’s death in Gallup on Friday after years of suffering from various illnesses that rarely kept him from his duties. After serving as a Marine, Pinto was selected to the New Mexico Senate in 1976 and represented a district that included the Navajo Nation for more than four decades. The region is one of the poorest in the country. Born on the Navajo Nation to a family of sheep herders, Pinto didn’t start formal schooling until he was nearly a teenager. “At the age of 12, I was in kindergarten,” Pinto told the Albuquerque Journal in a 2007 interview. “I guess I did all right.”\n\nNew York\n\nCobleskill: The State University of New York at Cobleskill is launching a new four-year program in “canine training and management” amid a surge in demand for specially trained dogs to detect threats and assist veterans in the wake of 9/11. While several institutions hand out training certificates, and at least one small private college awards a bachelor’s in dog handling, the program at Cobleskill is more ambitious in its scope. Professor Stephen Mackenzie says he developed Cobleskill’s Bachelor of Technology degree partly in response to a heightened demand for dogs capable of sniffing out explosives in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The need for service dogs trained to assist those with post-traumatic stress disorder or reduced mobility has also expanded as veterans started returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: As the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches, historians and educators worry that the World War II milestone is losing its resonance with today’s students. In North Carolina as in many other states, D-Day isn’t part of the required curriculum, though some teachers do use the anniversary to spend extra time on the June 6, 1944, battle. It’s not a stand-alone topic in France, which was liberated from German occupation. German schools concentrate on the Holocaust and Nazi dictatorship. Schools in Russia avoid D-Day because they believe the victories on the Eastern Front won the war. In Cary, North Carolina, Kasey Turcol taught her students at Crossroads FLEX High School about D-Day, including lesser-known aspects like tales of a Spanish spy.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group raising awareness about post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide among combat veterans has finished a 400-mile walk. Brady’s Border2Border Ruck March began on the state’s western border Tuesday and concluded Saturday in Fargo. The event honors Brady Oberg, who served in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. After coming home, Oberg suffered from PTSD and killed himself in 2015. KFGO- AM reports that a group of 16 family and friends participated in the march. They each carried a bag with 20 pounds to represent the 20 veterans with PTSD who take their lives every day. The first march took place a year ago. Oberg’s family started the Brady Oberg Legacy Foundation to raise awareness of PTSD.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city is working to preserve the heritage of century-old trees planted to commemorate area soldiers who died in World War I. The planting of the 9-mile stretch of red oaks that runs through Cleveland and into suburban Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights marked its 100th anniversary on Memorial Day. Local officials are taking an inventory of remaining Liberty Row trees, many of which have died over the years, with some plaques lost or damaged. The greater Cleveland area was one of the first communities nationally to envision a multi-mile stretch of trees as a memorial to fallen soldiers. Between 1919 and 1924, more than 800 oak trees were planted, each with a bronze plaque at its base engraved with the name of a fallen soldier.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the state’s largest-ever appropriations bill, an $8.1 billion spending plan that funds pay raises for teachers and state workers and pumps tens of millions more dollars into public schools. Flanked by Republican legislative leaders, the first-year governor signed the bill Friday, a day after the Legislature adjourned the 2019 session. The deal also socks away an additional $200 million into a state savings account. When combined with additional revenue in the state’s Rainy Day Fund, the savings will give the state more than $1 billion in reserve funds. Democrats criticized the plan as not doing enough for working-class Oklahomans and argued the additional $200 million was needed to shore up previous cuts to core services.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge on Friday ordered a man to learn about the Sikh religion and submit a report to the court as part of his sentence for an attack on a Sikh shopkeeper in Salem, a civil rights group said. Andrew Ramsey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of intimidation and assault in the Jan. 14 incident targeting Harwinder Singh Dodd, according to a release from the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S. The intimidation count is considered a hate crime, the group said. Witnesses said Ramsey pulled on Dodd’s beard after he refused to sell him cigarettes without an ID, punched him and pulled him to the ground. Bystanders restrained Ramsey until police arrived. Dodd, who came to the U.S. from India and owns the convenience store, noted in a written statement to the court that hate crimes are on the rise in America. The FBI says hate crimes increased by 40% in Oregon from 2016 to 2017.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Weather officials say the state has already recorded the average number of tornadoes for a year even before the summer period in which severe weather is most common. Meteorologist Sarah Johnson of the National Weather Service says 16 tornadoes – the yearly average – have had preliminary confirmation in the commonwealth so far this year. Severe weather is more common in June and into July, but that’s not a hard and fast rule. For example, Johnson says, a large outbreak of severe weather occurred Oct. 2 across Pennsylvania. In recent weeks, Johnson says, the high plains and Mid-Atlantic have been getting the brunt of low-pressure systems bringing precipitation. On Thursday, six tornado warnings were issued across the commonwealth in a span of just two hours.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The mansion once owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Edith Wharton is on the market for nearly $12 million. The Providence Journal reports that Land’s End in Newport, where Wharton and her husband lived in the late 19th century, is for sale at $11.7 million. It was more recently owned by socialite Marion Oates Charles, who died there in December. The 24-room mansion on a 5.6-acre estate was built in 1880. It’s located on a street that runs between two of the city’s most famous thoroughfares, Bellevue Avenue and the Cliff Walk. Kendra Toppa, the listing agent, said the property “truly epitomizes Newport real estate at its finest.” Wharton won the Pulitzer for 1920’s “The Age of Innocence” and also wrote “Ethan Frome” and “The House of Mirth.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city kicked off 17 days of operas, plays, chamber music and jazz Friday as the world-renowned Spoleto Festival USA returns. The 43rd season of the arts festival began with the opening ceremony from Charleston City Hall. It will run through June 9. The spotlighted performance is the opera “Salome.” Spoleto plans a contemporary retelling of the 1905 Richard Strauss opera, based on an Oscar Wilde play of the same name about the Biblical story of the woman who asked for the head of John the Baptist. The Spoleto Festival USA choir will join the festival’s orchestra and the Charleston Symphony for a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. John Passion on June 4. The festival will take place in 11 indoor and outdoor venues.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHoughton: An 88-year-old man has made his mark on this farming community as a prolific gopher killer. Clayton Sanderson of Houghton estimates he has caught 22,000 of the varmints since he started hunting them down in 1997. Sanderson told the Aberdeen News he doesn’t poison the animals because poison is expensive, and he can’t reach their bodies if they go deep into their gopher holes to die, making it harder for him to turn them into profit. So he widens the top of the hole and sets a trap with two pressure-triggered arms. He says he’s been bitten only once in 22 years. Farmers hate gophers, he said, “with a passion,” because of the damage wrought on their farm equipment when they hit the mounds at the entrance of the gopher holes. Sanderson said he earns $3 for every set of gopher front paws he hands over to Shelby or Lansing township officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nJasper: A University of Tennessee doctoral student is resurrecting research that was abandoned nearly 80 years ago that could be crucial for Tennessee Valley Authority’s understanding of long-term weather patterns that factor into the agency’s decisions regarding water. Scientist Florence Hawley began research in the 1930s studying tree rings to understand long-term weather patterns in the Norris Basin, The Times Free Press reports. She worked at TVA in its earliest days but faced sexism on the job and was never allowed to publish her results, according to TVA officials. She abandoned TVA in the 1940s and went to work in the Southwest. Her research was recently found in the TVA archives. The utility provider approached the University of Tennessee about finishing the work, and doctoral student Laura Smith has taken on the task.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The police chief has announced a youth jobs program meant to give children something to do during high-crime summer months and better connect officers to underserved areas. The Dallas Morning News reports Chief U. Renee Hall says the DPD to You(th) initiative will focus on students from schools with higher rates of crime and arrests. The project involves recruiting 50 students, from schools primarily in South Dallas, and inserting them in occupations with city government agencies, nonprofits and the Dallas Police Department. Volunteers will mentor the students in the program. Assistant City Manager Jon Fortune says the program “is critical as we look for ways to have a greater impact on the lives of teens.” Police officials also aim to host a citywide youth community service day.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah Lake: On a recent visit to Utah Lake’s west shore, Alison Green scrutinized sandstone outcrops, measuring lines chiseled into the stone by ancient hands, then doing her best to replicate them on gridded sheets. The 12-year-old from Sandy inspected one petroglyph cut into rock hundreds of years ago by Fremont Indians. “It shows the person has braided legs, and that could be a birthing scene,” she said. “That could mean it was a fertile area.” Green was among two dozen middle schoolers from Sandy’s Blessed Sacrament Catholic School recently doing archaeological surveys at the Adelbert Doyle Smith Family Preserve as part of an effort to list the 196-acre site on the National Register of Historic Places. “The kids are doing the work the way an entry-level archaeologist out of college would,” says John McHugh, a science teacher at Blessed Sacrament leading the expedition. He calls the school’s archaeology club the Shovel Bums, after the moniker given to rookie archaeologists who do the grunt work at excavation sites.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Seven historic sites owned by the state are now open for the season. The sites include more than 80 historic structures and hundreds of acres of forest and farmland that opened Saturday. State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann says the historic sites include prehistoric camps, Revolutionary War sites and the homes of U.S. presidents. She says they all shed light on the history of Vermont. Among the sites that opened include the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch, the Old Constitution House in Windsor and the Hubbardton Battlefield in Hubbardton. More than 70 public events and programs are scheduled this season at Vermont’s State Historic Sites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A new television series with Ethan Hawke starring as the fiery abolitionist John Brown is set to film in the state. Gov. Ralph Northam’s office announced Thursday that production of the eight-part series will start in central Virginia this summer. The show is based on the novel “The Good Lord Bird” by best-selling author James McBride and is set to air on Showtime. Brown led a raid in 1859 on a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, in what is now West Virginia, hoping to start an armed slave rebellion. The rebellion didn’t happen, and Brown was later hanged for treason. Before the raid, Brown and a group of abolitionist settlers killed five pro-slavery settlers in Kansas in the Pottawatomie massacre.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane Valley: Proponents of creating a 51st state have held a bake sale to raise money for their cause. The Spokesman-Review reports that supporters of the proposed Christian conservative state, which would span parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, raised money by auctioning pies and other desserts. The Liberty State Gala drew about 200 people in the city of Spokane Valley on Thursday evening. Speakers included Washington state Rep. Matt Shea, a Spokane Valley Republican who has championed the Liberty State movement. Shea spoke of the cultural and political differences between eastern and western Washington, denied the existence of global warming, and claimed the United States is “a Christian nation” under siege by atheists and Communists. Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagen and county Prosecutor Larry Haskell also attended.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republicans in the state Senate have pitched a broad-based education plan that allows for charter schools but doesn’t include vouchers. Senate President Mitch Carmichael released a lengthy draft of the proposal late Friday and said it’s a compromise that folds in many ideas backed by Democrats. “Nobody gets everything they want,” he said. The legislation includes a pay raise for teachers, mental health services for students and a provision that would withhold pay for teachers if a school is closed because of a strike. The proposal comes as the GOP-led legislature nears special session debate on education measures. Carmichael said he put out the draft of the bill Friday to give lawmakers time to read it so they can come back this week and propose changes before the Senate reconvenes. Republican Gov. Jim Justice issued a statement praising the bill.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFifield: Rock music blared from speakers as spectators watched speedsters zoom around a track Sunday afternoon. It was a big day for racing, with NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 and the Indy 500, but the races in this northern Wisconsin community featured machines a bit slower than Indy cars – lawn mowers. While all the vehicles must start their careers as actual riding lawn mowers, racers make a few adjustments, resulting in mowers that can travel as fast as 60 mph. At Sunday’s races, which were a fundraiser for the Fifield Fire Department, 30 mowers competed in five classes on a dirt track an eighth of a mile long. Blades are removed from racing lawn mowers and steel welded on the frame for stability. In some classes, machines must run on original lawn mower engines. All must have hydraulic brakes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Symphony Orchestra has named Christopher Dragon as its new conductor and music director after a search lasting a year and a half. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Casper orchestra announced Thursday the selection of the Australia-born conductor, who was one of four finalists for the job. Dragon programmed and performed a concert in January with the orchestra. Search committee chair Eric Unruh says Dragon was a hit with the audience and musicians, and his creativity and innovation stood out. Dragon has been an associate conductor with the Colorado Symphony for four years. He will be the Denver orchestra’s resident conductor for the next two years. Dragon says every concert in Casper next year will feature a Beethoven piece in honor of the 250th anniversary of the composer’s birth.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/12/fentanyl-opioids-overdose-increase-savannah-chatham-county-ga/4969975001/", "title": "Fentanyl, other opioids lead to overdose increase in Savannah ...", "text": "A 32-year-old white male; a 21-year-old white female; a 38-year-old Hispanic male; a 24-year-old Black male; an 81-year-old white male and a 2-year-old child.

Texas-based Johnson Brothers Corp. will get the money if it completes work by Jan. 21 on the new Interstate 59/20 overpasses through Birmingham, state officials told news outlets. But the company will have to pay $250,000 a day if the opening is delayed past March 21. State transportation officials said the work is nearly done, and they will work out a schedule for opening the roads after the holidays. The more than $700 million project is replacing elevated highways built more than 45 years ago to accommodate 80,000 vehicles daily through the heart of downtown. Transportation officials said I-59/20 carried more than twice that number of vehicles before it was closed in January and demolished. The shutdown, which forced drivers to travel around the city on surface streets or Interstate 459, affected a more than mile-long section of I-59/20 from Red Mountain Expressway to Interstate 65. The state said it is keeping an eye on safety as contractors complete work that includes smoothing out the driving surface, installing lighting and adding stripes. Plans call for the area beneath the elevated highway to be used for community spaces including a park and an area for food trucks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A project that maintains seismic monitoring stations in Alaska needs more funding to continue fully operating, officials said. Scientists, lawmakers and federal agencies are promoting the permanent installation of the Transportable Array Network, The Anchorage Daily News reported Tuesday. The National Science Foundation project was installed temporarily beginning in 2014. The stations can monitor earthquake activity and track weather, wildfires and volcanoes. The system can also detect North Korean nuclear testing, officials said. Many of the network’s stations in northern and western Alaska are set to be removed over the next two years if funding is not secured to maintain them permanently, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks took more than 43 stations in southeast Alaska in September, officials said. The center operates through an external grant on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, but it will need more funds to support the monitoring network for the long term. Permits for the stations will need to be renewed if they stay in the ground, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center requested $2.5 million in state funding to help maintain the network, money that would go to the University of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of southwestern Arizona through Friday morning as another storm rolls off the Pacific, over California and into the 48th State. The heaviest rainfall was expected Thursday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service. The forecast office in Phoenix said light to moderate rain will spread across southern and central Arizona Thursday night, with some lingering showers and maybe a few thunderstorms on Friday. All of this could be great news for skiers and snowboarders. Another round of snow is forecast to hit northern Arizona late Thursday through Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, where an additional 4 to 8 inches is expected. The storm that rolled through the state over Christmas dumped 11.8 inches of snow on Flagstaff’s airport as of 5 p.m. Wednesday. Arizona Snowbowl reported 47 of its 48 trails served by ski lifts were open as of Christmas Day.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An optometrist group is asking the state Supreme Court to reconsider its Dec. 12 ruling that directed the state to count all the signatures submitted in favor of holding a referendum on a law that would allow optometrists to perform a broader range of surgeries. Secretary of State John Thurston had not counted all the signatures because canvassers didn’t file paperwork required under a law enacted earlier this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. However, the court ruled the requirements weren’t in effect when the Safe Surgery Arkansas committee submitted its signatures. The law in question, Act 579, would allow optometrists to perform additional procedures that currently only ophthalmologists can. Much of the debate has focused on whether optometrists have the necessary training. The referendum would allow voters in next year’s general election to decide if Act 579 should take effect. Supporters of the referendum believe eye surgery should only be conducted by medical doctors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLaguna Beach: A sea lion pup was in critical condition but “still feisty” Wednesday after it fell more than 30 feet from a footbridge onto a highway, officials said. The 33-pound pup, now named “Lords-a-Leaping,” was dehydrated and emaciated when it was rescued Monday night in Laguna Beach by staff from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, The Orange County Register reported. It did not appear to suffer any fractures or internal injuries. Most animals at the center are considered to be in critical condition for at least a week after they arrive, animal care coordinator Wendy Leeds told the Associated Press. “He is up, he is eating and he is still feisty,” Leeds said. The animal crawled up to the footbridge and jumped onto the shoulder of the highway before staff from Pacific Marine Mammal Center arrived. It was unclear what prompted the pup to head to the footbridge.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: The town of Breckenridge canceled its New Year’s Eve fireworks display over environmental considerations, officials said. The decision was a continuation of the town’s decision earlier this year to celebrate holidays in ways that have a less environmental impact, Summit Daily reported. The town canceled its 2019 Fourth of July fireworks display, which officials said was a result of concerns about fire safety and potential negative effects on the forest and wildlife. The town council opted to remain consistent with its summer holiday cancellation, Breckenridge spokeswoman Haley Littleton said. Breckenridge Ski Resort has not changed plans to hold its annual New Year’s Eve torchlight parade, in which ski and snowboard instructors carry torches and ride from the top of one of the mountain’s peaks down to the resort village.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Farmers are being asked to suggest ways to improve the state’s Connecticut Grown campaign, an effort to raise awareness about produce and other agricultural products grown and sold in the state. Bryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture said his agency plans to embark on an integrated marketing campaign that will promote Connecticut Grown products during 2020 and beyond. The program was developed to assist producers and retailers of Connecticut farm products by raising awareness and increasing direct-to-consumer and wholesale buying. During his visits to over the past few months to numerous farms and businesses, Hurlburt said he heard a clear message that promotion of the Connecticut Grown brand needs to be improved.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The remains of a 33-year-old American soldier killed in combat in Afghanistan have been returned to the United States on Wednesday, arriving at Dover Air Force. Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble of Washington Township, New Jersey, was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind the attack. Goble was assigned to 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Pentagon has said Goble’s unit was engaged in combat operations when he suffered fatal injuries. Multiple U.S. officials, including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Wednesday what the military calls a dignified transfer in which the cases containing the remains are transferred to a vehicle from the aircraft that ferried them to the United States.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Metro admits it “did not follow safety procedures” – or follow a 2015 guideline from federal investigators – when it sent a Red Line train to investigate sparks on the tracks during Dec. 10’s morning’s rush, WUSA-TV reported. Metro safety watchdogs said riders were put in danger. A transit agency investigation of the incident found that a rail operations controller radioed the operator of Train 130 to check out a track problem near Tenleytown, “but failed to instruct Train 130 to offload its passengers before beginning the inspection.” NTSB investigators said trains carrying passengers should not be used to scope out track issues.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach: Who needs a sleigh when you have a surfboard? Some 600 surfers dressed as Santa chose surfboards instead of sleighs on Tuesday during an annual Christmas Eve surfing fundraiser in Cocoa Beach. Almost 10,000 spectators turned out for the 10th Annual Surfing Santas event along Florida’s Space Coast. The surfing fundraiser raised $40,000 for the Florida Surf Museum and a nonprofit that helps people with cancer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: A manufacturer of plastic stretch film is planning to open a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. Zummit Plastics, based in Phoenix, is expanding with plans to create 50 jobs and invest $25 million into the project in Columbus, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. The location and opening date were not announced, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported.. “This announcement is a fantastic way to wrap up 2019,” said Russ Carreker, chairman of the Development Authority of Columbus. “We are grateful that Zummit Plastics decided to choose Columbus as the place to achieve business success with their environmentally-friendly stretch film products.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Hawaii Police Department has gone $3 million over budget primarily because of the necessity of an increased police presence near the site of demonstrations at the Mauna Kea Access Road, an official said. Assistant Chief Samuel Thomas told the Hawaii County Police Commission of the budget overrun Friday, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. Since July, demonstrators have blocked access to the summit of Mauna Kea to prevent the construction of a giant telescope. Demonstrators have said the Thirty Meter Telescope could damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The department’s increased presence on Daniel K. Inouye Highway has required an increase in officer overtime payments, Thomas said. The county has accrued more than $5 million in law enforcement expenses related to Mauna Kea demonstrations and increased traffic enforcement on the highway, Thomas said. Thomas told commissioners the police budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, is just more than $70 million, adding that a budget meeting with the county Department of Finance is scheduled for January. The state has spent about $15 million to provide safe access to the mountain, Democratic Gov. David Ige said earlier this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposed settlement for home and small business solar panels, officials said. The agreement would have changed how Idaho Power Co. customers are credited for the solar power they produce and put into the grid, The Idaho Mountain Express reported Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached in October by Idaho Power, utilities commission staff and seven other entities involved net metering, officials said. Net metering records the amount of power produced by a home power producer relative to the amount the home consumes, officials said. The commission’s Dec. 20 order rejected the settlement agreement, finding the record created from the settlement proceedings was insufficient to support the proposal. The public was not adequately notified the agreement might result in significant changes to Idaho Power’s net metering program, the commission said.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: Authorities in southwest Illinois made a Christmas-morning rescue after a woman who climbed up bluffs above a city park got stuck on a ledge for hours. Madison County 911 received a call that a woman could be heard calling for help around 1 a.m. Wednesday, according to The (Alton) Telegraph. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said a woman climbed the bluffs in a part of Piasa Park with thick wooded brush. He estimated she had been there since 4 p.m. Tuesday and was stranded about 30 feet off the ground in an area with loose rock. Crews used a ladder to rescue her after cutting a path to the woman with a chainsaw, Jemison said. The woman did not appear to have serious injuries, according to the newspaper. Authorities said the woman gave no reason for the attempted climb and was able to walk through thick brush before being transported to an area hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nBedford: State conservation officers are investigating the deadly shooting of a bald eagle in southern Indiana and offering a reward to anyone with information. The investigation began last week after a landowner notified a Lawrence County animal control officer and officials with the Brown County Indiana Raptor Center of an injured bird. It had suffered an apparent gunshot wound and was treated for injuries but died, officials said. Authorities are seeking help from the public for any information and offered a $1,000 reward. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Earlier this week, Louisiana wildlife agents said at least one bald eagle might have been killed in the state’s northwest region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of liquor retailers alleges that the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division illegally marked up the price of their products for years. The lawsuit comes days after the division’s former comptroller filed his own lawsuit alleging he was fired for blowing the whistle on the illegal price markups. Attorney Stuart Higgins represents the plaintiffs in both cases. Division spokesman Tyler Ackerson said Monday the agency is consulting with legal counsel and has no comment. He said last week that the allegations filed by former comptroller Todd Halbur were not true. The new lawsuit was filed on behalf of Class E liquor license holders who purchased products from the agency, Iowa’s exclusive wholesaler and distributor of liquor. Those licensees include nearly 1,700 grocery, liquor and convenience stores. State law allows the division to mark up products by 50% above what it paid before selling them to licensees. The lawsuit alleges that the markups that the agency assessed for years was “in excess of the statutory cap” and seeks reimbursement for the overcharges and other damages. It doesn’t elaborate on the amount involved.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Zoo animals in Topeka will soon be making use of castoff live Christmas trees. The city said in a news release that the trees can be dropped off at a special location at Gage Park, where the zoo is located. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said animals that can benefit from the trees include lions, tigers, owls, mountain lions, giraffes, black bears and painted dogs. Once the animals make use of the trees, they will be ground up and turned into mulch. The trees must be free of ornaments, hooks, tinsel and tree stands. They also can’t be in plastic bags.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Effective next week, motorists with some special license plates will be required to pay an additional charitable donation to the organization represented on the plate. Currently, $10 donations are optional, but starting Monday, the $10 donation will be required. The change affects 29 special license plates, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said in a news release. Most special plates already have a donation requirement that will not change. The legislation changing the requirement for special plates was passed during this year’s General Assembly. It also requires approved nonprofit organizations to maintain at least 500 registrations annually for the cabinet to continue producing the plate design. New fees for the 29 special plates will be $44 when first purchased and $44 at annual registration renewal. Currently, the cost is $44 at initial purchase and $31 at annual renewal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two elderly sisters have completed their goal of attending mass at every Catholic church in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. It took them nearly 20 years. Beverly Kelly, 84, and her sister, Pat Mahaffey, 88, crossed the final church off their list on Sunday when they attended 11 a.m. mass at the St. Joseph Abbey Church near Covington, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported. It was the 160th church where the sisters attended Mass. That’s more than the 120 churches and chapels in the archdiocese. But some churches have closed since they started their journey. They also went to some churches outside the New Orleans area. They aimed for one church a month, figuring that would take them roughly 10 years, according to the newspaper. But they revisited many churches along the way and were delayed when Hurricane Katrina struck. Two other sisters were part of the effort, but they died. That made Sunday’s Mass emotional. “We were a very close family,” Mahaffey, 88, said. “Sybil (one of the sisters) was sort of the instigator in this church quest. I said a prayer: ‘God, I’m sorry you couldn’t spare her to complete this.’ But I feel she is watching us.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A cold snap followed by warming temperatures has left many lakes and ponds in the state with dangerously thin levels of ice, the Maine Warden Service has warned. The service is urging residents to exercise caution before venturing out on any ice-covered Maine waterways. Ice conditions vary widely across the state, and that means residents must check the thickness of ice before going onto it for activities such as ice fishing. The service recommends ice fishermen and others check the ice in different places using an auger or another means of making a “test hole” that gauges thickness. It’s a good idea to make several such holes, the state said. People venturing onto the ice should also bring a partner, avoid areas with currents, look for honeycombed ice and take other safety precautions, the state said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Solid Waste Division of Worcester County will hold its annual collection of Christmas trees through Jan. 31. Area residents can drop off Christmas trees at the Central Landfill in Newark and the Berlin, Pocomoke and Snow Hill Homeowners Convenience Centers at no cost. Businesses and organizations that sold trees will not be permitted to drop off trees at the convenience centers but can take them to the Central Landfill, where applicable tipping fees will be assessed. The trees will be ground into mulch for use at the Central Landfill. For more information, contact Recycling Manager Mike McClung at (410) 632-3177.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids, and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: WOOD-TV reported that doctors in Detroit removed a kidney from Logan Bosselaar on Christmas Eve and transplanted it to Vanessa Bosselaar. The surgery had been in the works for weeks. Doctors were surprised that Logan was a perfect transplant match for his 24-year-old wife, who has a serious kidney disease. They live in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids. It’s been a challenging month: The Bosselaars were in a rollover crash after a medical appointment a few weeks ago but had only minor injuries. “The fact that we were OK from our car accident and then to go in and have a successful surgery – that’s amazing,” Logan said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Before heading out to deliver presents for Christmas, Santa made a special stop last week at the CentraCare – St. Cloud Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to visit babies who were dressed for the occasion. The March of Dimes provided the outfits – most of them donated – including tiny hats made by one of CentraCare’s NICU nurses. The bows were also handmade, showing how each baby is a gift to their family. Hospital officials said Tuesday that Santa was expected to return overnight to fill Christmas stockings.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Warren County supervisors voted to delay a decision on hauling away flood debris, which could cost the county more than $100,000. A total of 24 homes at Eagle Lake have been demolished by volunteers following flooding. The delay means the next board of supervisors will decide on the move after they are sworn in on Jan. 1 to begin new four-year terms. Water trapped inside a levee system stood for months this year. A floodgate that allows the water to drain from what’s called the Yazoo backwater region was kept closed because it was preventing even worse flooding from the Mississippi River. Under the plan, the county would place dumpsters in the Eagle Lake area to collect debris. That would cut down on the number of time-consuming round trips to the county’s landfill. But county emergency manager John Elfers estimates nearly 250,000 cubic yards of debris needs to be hauled away, equivalent to 305 dumpsters. That would cost the county more than $137,000. Officials say Warren County must pay for the work itself and isn’t eligible for federal disaster reimbursement. Outgoing supervisors asked county employees to make a new estimate of the amount of debris, as well as determine whether it’s all on public rights-of-way. Mississippi counties are barred by state law from working on private property.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Education officials said they have a plan that would not only increase teachers’ pay but also offer raises and attract them to positions that are challenging to fill. The state has one of the worst teacher compensations in the country, ranking at 40th with the average salary of $48,000, according to data from the National Education Association. But a new proposal could lift Missouri up to 26th with an average salary of about $54,000. Paul Katnik, an assistant education commissioner at the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, presented a nearly $400 million proposal to the State Board of Education during its December monthly meeting. The three-part plan calls for increasing the base pay for teachers from $25,000 to $32,000, offering teachers a $4,000 raise and creating a fund to lure teachers to take on hard-to-fill positions. The fund would allocate $75 million to recruit teachers to work in high-poverty or rural schools or teaching subjects such as high school science or English as a second language classes for immigrants. Education officials, teachers and education associations penned the plan.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: State parks across Montana will offer guided hikes on New Year’s Day as part of the “First Day Hikes” annual tradition across the U.S. Some 55,000 people walked more than 133,000 miles in state parks nationwide on New Year’s Day last year, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. This year, among the Montana parks participating, Missouri Headwaters State Park will offer a 3-mile family friendly loop at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The land had been used for thousands of years by the Bannock, Salish, Shoshone, Crow and Blackfeet tribes, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The Lewis and Clark expedition camped at the site in 1805 on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Later, the land was used by fur traders as a meeting place. It was also where the state’s first flour mill was built. The mill supplied flour to gold miners throughout southwest Montana. Missouri Headwaters State Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Participants can meet at the main picnic grounds near the Gallatin River. The hike will begin at 11 a.m. David Andrus, manager of the 532-acre park, said the event will include hot chocolate and toasted bagels beginning at 10 a.m.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific is continuing its fight against reinstating a train engineer who defecated on a locomotive connection knuckle. The company filed an appeal last week to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Last month a district judge in Omaha upheld an arbitration board’s decision that the fired engineer should be reinstated because termination was “excessive discipline.” Union Pacific had sued the employee union to overturn the board’s order to put Matthew Lebsack back on the job. The lawsuit says Lebsack walked past the locomotive cab bathroom on Nov. 20, 2016, when the train was stopped. It said he left the locomotive and defecated on the metal knuckle that connected the locomotive to a rail car. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Buescher said in his ruling that he didn’t understand why the board didn’t think Lebsack’s conduct was worthy of upholding his termination. But Buescher also said the law didn’t let him consider the merits of the arbitration board’s decision, but only whether that decision fell within the board’s discretion under the provisions of railroad-union contract. He said Union Pacific presented no evidence showing the board’s decision was not within its discretion.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Veterans Village has announced plans to add 150 affordable units to the Nevada housing community and change its name to SHARE Village Las Vegas. The master-planned community will also be opened to nonveterans, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday. The nonprofit organization had been planning to expand the affordable housing community, and a fatal fire accelerated the timeline, Veterans Village founder and President Arnold Stalk said. Six people died and 13 were injured Saturday in a fire at Alpine Motel Apartments. A Las Vegas Fire Department official said the blaze was the deadliest in the city’s history. In addition to those killed or injured, 30 to 35 residents were displaced from their homes and were assisted by the American Red Cross. Five of the 13 injured were initially listed in critical condition, including a pregnant woman. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but it appeared to have originated at a stove. There was no evidence of criminal activity, the fire department said. After the Alpine Motel fire, Stalk wanted to “let the public know that we are expanding our mission and services,” he said. SHARE Village Las Vegas also offers year-round crisis intervention centers, medical and mental health services, employment training, nutrition programs, and other services as part of its public-private partnerships.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Two state senators hope to increase accountability and transparency in the budgeting process for the state’s community college system. Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, and Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, sit on the Senate Finance Committee. They expressed concern after the New Hampshire Technical Institute announced that it is laying off 10 people Dec. 27, including senior professors in the departments of English, education, accounting and social science. Although the layoff announcement came after the filing deadline for new legislation, the senators said they will seek some kind of legislative fix to address the issue. College President Gretchen Mullin-Sawicki has said the decision was “very painful, but unfortunately necessary to create a more sustainable institution” at a time when enrollment has dropped 8% in the last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township:A home that caught fire Christmas Day reignited early Thursday morning as multiple fire crews were back on the scene in the southeastern corner of town, Capt. Greg Carpino said in a news release. A video of the fire posted by News 12 showed smoke and flames coming from the second floor of the three-story house at 2379 Peter Court. Smoke could be smelled all around the area toward Point Pleasant Beach because of weather conditions preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere Thursday. The fire had been extinguished again as of 9 a.m. and the cause remains under investigation, Carpino said. Township police said the fire first started around 2:05 p.m. Wednesday. Everyone in the home was accounted for and were uninjured, but a family pet died, according to a GoFundMe page set up for the family. As of Thursday morning, more than $2,000 of the $20,000 goal had been raised. On Wednesday, dozens of emergency vehicles blocked off the cul-de-sac on Peter Court as scores of firefighters worked in and around the smoking house into the late afternoon.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: State officials are planning another public meeting focused on the state’s oversight and scientific monitoring of environmental impacts at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Environment Department has scheduled the next meeting for Jan. 9 at the University of New Mexico campus in Los Alamos. The focus will be a 2016 agreement the state signed with the U.S. Energy Department regarding the cleanup of contamination and other responsibilities of the lab. The order spells out milestones the lab needs to meet with its cleanup campaigns and establishes corrective actions for the release of hazardous wastes or groundwater contamination. Watchdogs have been critical of the pace of cleanup projects at the northern New Mexico lab. Earlier this year, environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit over water pollution downstream from the lab. The groups asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue a permit that would specifically regulate urban stormwater runoff from developed areas at the lab, the town of Los Alamos and the nearby community of White Rock.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed Thursday a study to look into what it would take to bring high-speed rail to New York. Cuomo is proposing bringing together outside experts to look at the state’s past reports on high-speed rail and come up with a new plan. The Democrat’s idea was released Thursday as part of the governor’s 2020 State of the State agenda. Cuomo said previous plans over the last two decades have long said high-speed rail projects would take decades and prove too expensive for New York. The governor said most of New York’s population lives along the Amtrak’s Empire Corridor through New York City, Albany and Buffalo, and those lines often average 51 mph. He has said that makes travel on them the “slowest method available for New Yorkers.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fight over the critically endangered red wolf has returned to court as Gov. Roy Cooper sought immediate help for the dozen or so remaining in the wild and federal biologists planned to transfer wolves into the recovery area for the first time in years. In late November, Cooper sent the secretary of the interior a sharply worded letter warning that, with no more than 14 known wolves in the wild, “the American red wolf is on the brink of extinction.” He noted that in 2019, no litters of red wolf pups were born in the wild for the first time in the history of the reintroduction program. Red wolves once occupied much of the Eastern U.S. but were driven to near-extinction by trapping, hunting and habitat loss before they were reintroduced to North Carolina in 1987. Their range is limited to five North Carolina counties. Another 200 live in captive breeding programs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Police Department said it has received numerous reports of mail being stolen from residential mailboxes. Two suspected vehicle descriptions have been provided to police. One is a dark colored-sport utility vehicle and the other is a white four-door sedan, according to police Sgt. Mike Jennings. Police have no further details. Jennings said the thefts have happened in the late night and early morning hours in an area south of 24th Avenue and east of 20th Street South. Police are recommending that residents do not leave outgoing mail for pickup in their mailboxes overnight and that they ask the Post Office to hold their mail then they are out of town.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A New York-based sports network has turned to the federal courts in its trademark dispute with Ohio State University over use of the letter “O.” Overtime Sports Inc., an online network focusing on high school basketball and football, has a capital O with sloping corners as its logo. Its application to trademark the logo is pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Ohio State asked the company in July to stop using the logo, saying it was too close to its own trademarked octagonal “block O” letter. Overtime Sports disagrees with Ohio State’s position and on Monday filed a federal lawsuit in New York City asking that the university be prohibited from trying to stop the use of the logo. The lawsuit noted that Ohio State’s “O” contains neither rounded edges nor a rectangle in the center, as the company’s logo does. It also argued there’s no danger of someone confusing the letters, and that Overtime Sports has not unfairly competed with Ohio State or violated any of its rights. Ohio State declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking a public vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma has temporarily abandoned its effort. The two proponents of the initiative petition – Amy Young and Vanessa Avery – notified the Secretary of State’s office Monday that they were withdrawing the petition they filed earlier this month. Young said in a statement she grew concerned about the impact that recreational marijuana might have on existing medical marijuana businesses and on children who are able to receive medicinal marijuana. A spokeswoman for the group, Michelle Tilley, said they plan to rewrite the petition to include greater protections for the medical marijuana industry and submit it again. If passed, it would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to allow adult use of marijuana and impose a 15% tax on the sale of marijuana, in addition to state and local taxes. Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program launched last year and has been wildly successful, with more than 220,000 patients and 1,500 dispensary licenses issued so far.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: Authorities are searching for a skier from California who went missing while skiing at an Oregon resort on Christmas Day. The search for Ashlee Gingerich began around 5 p.m. Wednesday when Deschutes County deputies were alerted she had not reunited with her skiing partners at Mt. Bachelor. The Ski Patrol swept all the runs right away and did not find her. Deschutes County Search and Rescue professionals and volunteers then got involved. The search resumed early Thursday. KOIN reported that Gingerich, 30, was last seen around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorth Huntingdon: Police said a western Pennsylvania woman and her boyfriend were both charged with assault for a fight she said began when he found her wrapping presents for another boyfriend. The Tribune-Review said Daniel W. Hill and Diedra L. Dibucci, both 50 years old, were arrested after the incident in the North Huntingdon apartment they shared. Police answered a call about a man with a knife and had to force their way inside. That’s where they said they found Hill on the floor, with injuries and scratches to his face and neck. Dibucci told officers Hill threw a chair at her and grabbed a kitchen knife. Hill was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest. He was jailed after failing to post bail. An attorney was not listed for him in court records. Court records indicated Dibucci faces an assault charge. She did not appear to have a listed phone number.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza, who has three years left in his second mayoral term, is considering a run for governor in 2022. He said he still has to consider various factors, including whether he can raise enough money to compete in what will likely be a competitive Democratic primary field, The Boston Globe reported. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo won’t be able to run in 2022 because of term limits. Elorza has more than $600,000 in his campaign account. Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Lieutenant Gov. Daniel McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea are widely expected to run in the Democratic primary for governor in 2022.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAndrews: Members of Spirit Filled Ambassadors for Christ church said someone broke into a building they use for gatherings and set several fires. Someone also broke nearly all the windows on a church bus sometime early Sunday morning, Pastor Deshawn Rouse said. Several tablecloths in the Georgetown County church’s Executive Hall were set on fire. Pictures posted to the church’s Facebook page show burned tables, soot on the walls and other damage. The church’s sanctuary was not damaged, so services went on even with heavy hearts, Rouse told WMBF-TV. The State Law Enforcement Division is helping Andrews Police investigate the fire and vandalism. The state agency has been called in to investigate most church fires in South Carolina since a series of blazes at houses of worship in the 1990s. Rouse said the FBI has also been called in to help the investigation at the predominately African American church, also something that routinely happens in arson cases with mostly black congregations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: An acting supervisor has been selected for the Black Hills National Forest until a replacement is named for the outgoing leader. Andrew Johnson, the supervisor of the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, will manage the South Dakota wildness area for up to four months, the Forest Service said. The current supervisor, Mark Van Every, is retiring next week. Johnson will start on Jan. 6. The Black Hills National Forest covers 1.2 million acres in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. Offices are located in Sundance and Newcastle, Wyoming, and Custer, Rapid City and Spearfish in South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:A new poll shows Tennessee voters strongly support the spending of federal dollars to provide child care options. As well, voters want to see increased early childhood education opportunities in the state, according to the poll released on Wednesday by Tennesseans for Quality Early Education. The poll comes days after a Vanderbilt University survey also showed similar results – that voters support spending the state’s federal grant reserves to subsidize child care for low-income workers. The TQEE survey found 71% of voters said the state should use all of the federal funding it receives because there are not enough quality, affordable child care options for families. The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies surveyed 600 likely Tennessee voters from Nov. 18-21 and sampled voters across the state’s political, demographic and geographic lines, according to a news release. Overall, 93% of state voters view early childhood education – including the role of child care – as a bedrock to the short- and long-term success of children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Texas woman who drove to Mexico to deliver Christmas gifts to a sprawling refugee camp housing people waiting for U.S. court dates said Wednesday she was detained by authorities there for two days. Anamichelle Castellano said she and another volunteer for her nonprofit group were stopped Monday at a bridge crossing from Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Mexico. She said authorities discovered a small box of ammunition inside the car she was driving, which she said was left inside by her husband. Mexico has strict laws against entering the country with guns or ammunition. Those laws occasionally ensnare Americans crossing the border. Castellano said she spent Monday night sleeping on a couch with her 9-year-old daughter in a government office. She gave a statement Tuesday to someone she believed to be a prosecutor, then was allowed to leave a few hours later. The prosecutor’s office in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah firefighters are among the U.S. federal and state personnel who have traveled to Australia to help stop brush fires that have prompted a national emergency, officials said. Five federal agencies and 10 states including Utah have sent 21 firefighters to Australia, The Deseret News reported Tuesday. The state of emergency was declared because of a massive fire near Sydney, with other national park and mountain fires expected to fuse as brush fires continue to spread across 1,563 square miles of Australia, authorities said. The fires have been fueled by 25 mph winds amid temperatures reaching 113 degrees, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Two women have started a pet food pantry to assist animal owners in need. Linda Groce and Theresa Jones opened the pantry Dec. 17 and plan to keep it open until January, the Rutland Herald reported. Groce said she was inspired by a similar effort in another city. The pantry will accept pet food donations Monday through Thursday. If the pantry continues to do well, and if space permits, the pair would like to bring it back next year, Groce said. Leftover donations will be donated to the Rutland Cupboard, local rescue organizations and the Feline Connection.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A lawmaker has filed a bill that would scrap the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and add one on Election Day. Del. Joseph Lindsey’s measure is one of hundreds lawmakers will consider when they convene next month for the start of the 2020 legislative session. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. For a time, the holiday was merged with the one celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But the 2000 General Assembly brought an end to Lee-Jackson-King Day when it voted to create a separate holiday for King. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slave-holding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. Lindsey, a Democrat whose district includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, is the new chair of the House privileges and elections committee. He is the first black lawmaker to serve in that role, according to the legislative black caucus.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that drivers must use their signal every time they turn or change lanes on a roadway. Thursday’s ruling reverses a Court of Appeals ruling that said a signal is required only when public safety is affected. The high court ruled that the plain language of the law requires drivers “to ensure turns and lane changes are done safely and with an appropriate turn signal.” The ruling was issued in the case of David Brown, who was arrested for driving under the influence in Kennewick in March 2015. State patrol officers pulled him over after he briefly turned on his left turn signal while approaching a light in a designated left turn lane but turned it off and did not reactivate it while at the light or making the turn. He was arrested after his breath test showed .26 breath alcohol content, more than triple the legal limit. Brown had argued that the evidence of the breath test should be suppressed because the underlying traffic stop was without cause, and a lower court agreed and dismissed the case. The only issue before the Supreme Court was whether Brown violated traffic laws. The case now goes back to the lower courts to proceed in accordance with the high court’s guidance on the initial stop.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The city isn’t going to force retired police officers and firefighters to return miscalculated and overpaid pension payments. The City Council decided Monday to keep the overpaid pensions where they are and correct any underfunded pensions, The Herald-Dispatch reported. Those whose pensions were underpaid will also receive back pay. Mayor Steve Williams said the city’s pension funds are now the strongest they have ever been, and the fund is making payments on time after having been late for months. In 2013, the police officer fund’s net worth was about $22.3 million. It has nearly doubled since then. The firefighter fund was about $13 million in 2013 and now sits at about $30 million. A 2017 review of the city’s pension calculations found that some workers were being paid too much and some were being paid too little.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A large number of people donated kidneys this year at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison – and in each case, it was a donation to a stranger. It’s unclear why there was a surge in kidney donations this year – 28 in all – but a staffer at the hospital has a simple theory: “Society in general just wants to do good right now,” Leza Warnke, a UW Hospital transplant coordinator, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We’re hurting for some ‘feel good.’ ” The 28 people who donated their kidneys are a rare type of donor known as “nondirected donors” because they’re willing to give to anyone, regardless of whether they know the person. Of the 28 donors, 22 were women and six were men. The ages of donors ranged from 23 to 78. Garet Hil, founder and CEO of the National Kidney Registry, said there were about 300 such donors nationwide this year, which still makes the act unusual. “We don’t know what’s driving it,” Hil said. “It’s still about one-in-a-million. These are very special people.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A woman from Alaska has donated body armor to a Wyoming K9 officer, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office said. The bullet and stab protective vest for K9 officer Arie comes from a donation by Denise Nading of Anchorage through a nonprofit organization called Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. Nading made the donation in memory of Mel Nading, an Alaska State Trooper and pilot who died in a helicopter crash in March 2013 while returning from rescuing a stranded snowmobiler in Talkeetna, Alaska, according to news reports. The vest is embroidered with: “In memory of Mel Nading, Pilot of Helo 1,” the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. Arie, who joined the sheriff’s office this fall, is trained in narcotics detection, suspect tracking and apprehension, building search and officer protection.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/01/pooch-hit-car-goes-ride-manatee-rescued-unusual-toilet-paper-roller-news-around-states/40525603/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: Selma University is holding an event Saturday to raise money that’s needed to pay off a more than $785,000 debt to the federal government. The school is trying to raise $2 million total. Any proceeds will also go to improve the campus, restore the school’s athletics program and establish an endowment fund. President Alvin Cleveland said the private school wasn’t recertified for the Federal Student Financial Assistance Program because of inadequate paperwork and incomplete files, so it’s being required to pay back financial aid. Selma University is affiliated with the Alabama State Missionary Baptist Convention. Another small, church-affiliated school in Selma, Concordia College, closed last year amid declining enrollment and financial problems.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: An accidental release of a smelly nontoxic chemical commonly added to propane and natural gas to give them a fragrance that can be detected caused multiple people to report a gas leak in downtown Fairbanks. The city said there was no gas leak or fire hazard. The owner of C&R Pipe and Steel Inc., Dennis Wilfer, said the chemical was mixed with water inside an unmarked cylinder that had been dropped off at his business for recycling. As workers sorted the metal, mercaptan leaked out, releasing a foul odor that moved north into downtown Fairbanks. City officials said the Fairbanks Fire Department responded to reports of a possible gas leak. The city confirms there was no gas leak or fire hazard.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Republic reported that the new downtown nightclub Track Club has closed less than a month after opening, according to a statement posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday afternoon. The post notified fans of the immediate closure and included instructions for what to do if you bought tickets for an upcoming show at the venue. Track Club was a collaboration between Phoenix developer Charles “Chuckie” Duff, Relentless Beats music promoter Thomas Turner and Rattle and Rum cocktail master Damon Scott. Duff, known for his adaptive reuse projects around Phoenix, oversaw the development and remodeling of DeSoto Central Market, transforming the space into a music venue complete with a full stage and multiple bars. Turner took the reigns for the music, scheduling EDM DJs to perform at the new nightclub. Scott designed cocktails for inside the music venue and more complex craft drinks for the outer bar area. The partners did not respond to request for comment before publication.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:The city will continue to levy 2.0 mills on real estate and personal property, the City Council decided Monday night. Council members on Oct. 17 voted to keep the city’s general millage at 2.0 mills for next year, but then later that meeting expressed an interest in revisiting the topic. The city’s millage rate was one of three topics scheduled to be discussed at Monday night’s meeting. All cities in Baxter County – and most in the state of Arkansas – levy a millage against real estate and personal property. That millage is collected by the county tax collector’s office when residents pay their property taxes and goes toward that city’s General Fund for various city expenses. During Monday night’s meeting, council member Jennifer Baker made the motion to raise the millage. The city is struggling with how to pay for a 23% increase in its health insurance premium. The city will need an additional $400,000 in 2020 to cover the rise in its health insurance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLake Elsinore:A small earthquake rattled the Lake Elsinore area on Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake struck at 2:44 a.m. with a magnitude of 3.0 at a depth of 5.6 miles. Its epicenter was 6.5 miles west-northwest of Lake Elsinore and about 7 miles northwest of Lakeland Village, according to data from the USGS.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Most school districts in the Denver and Colorado Springs area canceled classes Wednesday, a day after many of them sent home students early because of snow. The weather shut down a stretch of Interstate 70 east of Denver International Airport but it reopened early Wednesday. The snowy weather has been accompanied by cold temperatures. Denver broke a record for the lowest maximum temperature for Tuesday by reaching 18 degrees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: A New England aquarium beloved for its beluga whales is hoping to get five more of the marine mammals as part of a research project. Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut is home to the largest outdoor beluga whale habitat in the country. Three of the whales live in the habitat. The aquarium said it’s awaiting approval from the federal government for the transfer of five belugas that were born at a facility in Canada. Stephen Coan, president of Sea Research Foundation, said the whales would become part of a research program designed to increase general knowledge about the species and inform conservation efforts. The foundation operates the aquarium. Belugas are white whales that can weigh up to 3,500 pounds. Some of their populations are considered endangered.\n\nDelaware\n\nSlaughter Beach: Officials said three homes near the coast were heavily damaged in an accidental fire. News outlets reported the State Fire Marshal’s Office said an outdoor generator sparked the flames that burned the houses Wednesday afternoon in Slaughter Beach. Delaware Assistant State Fire Marshal Michael Chionchio said the damage is estimated at $800,000. No injuries were reported. The town doesn’t have fire hydrants. Mayor Harry Ward said 11 fire companies responded to help douse the flames. The fire happened on the same street where flames erupted on Christmas night in 2017 and destroyed at least two homes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The U.S. Air Force sent a letter to Balfour-Beatty Communities, one of the private companies that manage military housing, to demand an improvement plan, WUSA-TV reported. The letter follows up on issues WUSA-TV has been reporting on for months. Military families told the station they have been living with mold, lead paint and maintenance issues, which create safety concerns. The Air Force is requiring Balfour-Beatty to submit a comprehensive improvement plan by the end of the year. The letter goes on to detail the consequences if the Air Force does not see “prompt and substantial improvement.” WUSA-TV contacted a spokesperson for Balfour-Beatty Communities, which has its headquarters in Philadelphia, who said, “The company is redoubling its efforts to address the issues raised in the letter. We are committed to ensuring that the housing we provide to all of our residents is of a high standard. We are taking a number of steps to address maintenance concerns, including hiring specialists to provide additional oversight, training our people on best customer service practices, and hiring more maintenance and quality control experts. Balfour Beatty Communities is working directly with Air Force representatives to ensure their expectations are met.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A Bengal tiger has died at Busch Gardens after getting into an “atypical altercation” with its brother. The park announced Bala’s death in a statement Tuesday. Officials said a necropsy was being completed. Siblings Bala and Bhutan had lived in the park since 2007. Park spokeswoman Rebecca Romzek said Bhutan isn’t being treated for injuries, but they are closely checking him. The Tampa Bay Times reported eight tigers live at Busch Gardens and they rotate on and off in the park’s Jungala habitat where visitors can see them. Bala was known as the “redhead” of the park’s tigers. She had a strawberry white/blonde coloration, which is caused by a gene mutation that makes the tiger’s striping paler than usual.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Wildlife officials used a bulldozer to help rescue a manatee that got stuck in sand near Savannah. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources said the manatee was navigating a manmade shortcut between rivers near Savannah on Oct. 1 when it got stranded at low tide. That’s because the cut is being filled by the Army Corps of Engineers to create wetlands. The state agency posted a video online that showed wildlife workers keeping the manatee wet until a bulldozer plowed a trench that allowed river water to reach the animal. Workers then rolled the manatee onto a stretcher and guided it to deeper water. Manatees are protected as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They pass through Georgia waters on their way to Florida for the winter.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Federal geologists are examining samples of water from a growing pond in a Hawaii volcano’s crater. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory used a drone to collect water samples from a growing lake in Kilauea volcano’s crater, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. They will test the water’s chemistry to find out more about its origin and how much it is interacting with volcanic gases that come from deep magma. Geologists confirmed the presence of the water in the bottom of Halemaumau crater this summer. It is the first time in recorded history that water has appeared in the crater. Kilauea had a major eruption last year that caused the collapse of the crater to below the water table. Patricia Nadeau, a research geologist with HVO, said there has always been groundwater near the Kilauea summit but it had never reached the surface. Besides confirming that the water is not rain pooling in the crater, its composition can also tell researchers more about what’s happening deep underground where the volcano’s magma is.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal lawsuit challenging Idaho’s ballot initiative process as unconstitutional because it requires signatures from multiple legislative districts has been dismissed. Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye ruled Tuesday that Ryan Isbelle lacked standing to bring the lawsuit but didn’t rule on the merits of the case. Nye said Isbelle lacked standing because he hadn’t tried to get an initiative on the ballot. Nye didn’t rule on Isbelle’s claim that Idaho’s initiative rules violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Isbelle argued that an Idaho law passed in 2013 requiring signatures from 6% of registered voters in 18 legislative districts was unconstitutional. Before 2013, ballot initiatives required signatures from 6% of statewide registered voters. Isbelle argued the change unconstitutionally gave more weight to signatures in some districts.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: It was a real dog of a ceremony this week during a swearing-in at the state’s attorney’s office in Chicago. The newly sworn-in worker is a Labrador retriever named Hatty. The 2-year-old will ease the strain of criminal proceedings on young children and those with mental-health issues who have been victims of assault. She will handle up to 200 cases annually. Hatty is the office’s first emotional-support dog and was trained partly by inmates. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx presided over Tuesday’s swearing-in. Hatty stood on her hind legs over a table and placed her paw across a law book as an oath was administered.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:State officials are suspending work requirements for low-income residents who receive their health insurance through Medicaid while a federal lawsuit challenging the plan is sorted out. The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said it won’t be enforcing rules that require those not qualifying for exemptions to report 20 hours a month of work or related activity or face coverage loss after Dec. 31. The move comes after a lawsuit was filed in September against Indiana’s plan. Federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from allowing similar work requirements for Arkansas and Kentucky. Attorneys for Medicaid recipients said Congress intended medical care as the Medicaid program’s goal, and the Trump administration failed to account for potential coverage losses for thousands of people from work requirements.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: Some Iowa State students are pressuring the university administration to take action against people who have scrawled anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi slogans on campus. Dozens of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon at university President Wendy Wintersteen’s office to push their goal of a zero-tolerance university policy toward racism and anti-Semitism. Protest organizers said “Heil Hitler,” “no trans rights” and anti-Semitic slogans were written in chalk at various places on the campus last week. The Des Moines Register reported that posters and stickers advocating white nationalist viewpoints have been found on campus since 2016. Wintersteen spoke to a couple of the protest organizers and later emailed a statement that said she was proud of the students “for standing up against bigotry and racism.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Topeka Zoo officials said a 30-year-old Malayan sun bear was euthanized after suffering from several age-related medical conditions. The female bear, called Cup Cake, was euthanized Monday. She and a bear called Ho Ho came to the zoo in 2017 after their exhibit at a previous zoo was closed for construction. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said both bears were elderly when they arrived in Topeka and zoo officials anticipated they would not live long. He said they were kept in an area with keepers who specialized in working with geriatric animals. Cup Cake began limping on Saturday and her hind legs were useless by Sunday. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported the decision was made to euthanize Cup Cake when she developed head tremors Monday morning.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Distillers’ Association said distilleries filled more than 2.1 million barrels of bourbon in 2018. The state’s inventory of aging spirits reached 9.1 million barrels, mostly bourbon. The group said both figures are modern-era records. It’s the highest inventory in the 52 years that records have been kept. It’s also the only time since 1967 that Kentucky distillers filled more than 2 million barrels. The association said the figures came from Kentucky Department of Revenue data. Despite the continuing surge, the group said trade disputes and tariffs pose an industry threat. The association said Kentucky bourbon exports to European Union countries – the industry’s largest market – have plummeted through August, compared to the same time last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A Louisiana appeals court has overruled a judge who said prosecutors could not use the word “rape” during a man’s rape trial. In a ruling filed Wednesday, Judge Ben Willard in New Orleans granted a defense request to bar prosecutors and prosecution witnesses from using the word rape in an ongoing trial. Prosecutors appealed, noting the defendant faces multiple charges, including first-degree rape. A three-judge panel of Louisiana’s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that Willard was wrong to ban the use of the word rape by prosecutors. It’s unknown why attorneys with the New Orleans Public Defenders office made the request. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Willard did not spell out his reasoning in a filing with the appellate court.\n\nMaine\n\nArundel: A report from the Maine Center for Disease Control found PFAS chemical contamination in nearly half the public water supplies tested. The agency had 19 water supplies tested because of their proximity to potential sources of PFAS contamination, such as airports, landfills and paper mills. PFAS chemicals, which are sometimes described as “forever chemicals,” were found in nine of the water supplies. Maine CDC provided its report on Tuesday to a PFAS task force organized by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. PFAS chemicals were found in towns including Arundel, Georgetown and Topsham. Maine CDC’s summary of the findings said a high percentage of water systems declined to take part. A Maine CDC spokesperson said the data is evidence for mandatory monitoring for the chemicals in community water systems.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: A community service agency has come to the rescue of a deaf Maryland woman who faced a nearly $5,000 water bill because she couldn’t hear her toilet running. The Frederick News-Post reported the Frederick Community Action Agency stepped in Tuesday to help cover Denise Sansonese’s bill. Agency Assistant Director of Community Services Brad Peterson said it wants the city to reduce the bill by any amount and will do what’s necessary to take the balance down to zero if that doesn’t happen. Blake Sansonese said his mother went to the city to address the bill but was told there wasn’t an interpreter available to help her. Denise Sansonese said she never saw a letter city left on her door about the bill.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSpringfield: An MGM dealer said the casino has been paying him less than minimum wage and shorting overtime pay. Shawn Connors, of Uncasville, Connecticut, filed a complaint Monday in U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, alleging that he is entitled to more than the wage MGM Springfield has been paying. The Boston Globe reported Connors began working at the casino last summer, shortly before it opened. Connors said he should be paid more than the approximately $5 per hour rate he has been paid because he also receives tips. He added MGM never notified him that he would earn such a low basic wage, as is required by law. The lawsuit also claimed the casino underpaid tipped employees who worked overtime. An MGM spokesman said they have received the filing and will “respond accordingly.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: State environmental regulators are promising faster reviews of applications to protect homes or structures threatened by rising Great Lakes levels. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said Wednesday it will expedite permits for actions such as placing rocks or building seawalls to prevent erosion. Director Liesl Clark said permit consideration requires a balance between protecting property and safeguarding environmental features such as dunes, shorelines and bluffs. She said excessive or poorly designed shoreline protection structures can disrupt natural processes and damage neighboring properties. It usually takes 60 to 90 days to process shoreline permits. EGLE said it will act much faster where homes or infrastructure are at risk. The number of shoreline protection permits granted has risen sharply in recent years. In many cases, permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also are required for placing materials along the water.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A plan to dispose of deer carcasses during Minnesota’s upcoming rifle hunting season is unraveling over a waste hauler’s fears of spreading chronic wasting disease. The state placed special dumpsters in parts of central and southeastern Minnesota where the fatal deer brain disease has been found. The plan was to use the containers to safely dispose of potentially infected deer carcasses. But Waste Management will not accept deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting or that have the potential of being infected. With Minnesota’s rifle season about to start, officials are worried hunters will toss bones onto the land where the disease can spread to other deer. Officials of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources told state lawmakers Tuesday that Waste Management does not want to be held liable if the infectious material that causes chronic wasting spreads into the wild, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Waste Management spokeswoman Julie Ketchum told the Associated Press that the waste disposal company will handle any deer carcasses already in the dumpsters. But Waste Management is concerned about the prions, a misshaped protein that causes the disease in deer and elk and remains infectious in the environment for years, Ketchum said. The DNR has had difficulty convincing landfills to take potentially infected deer, MPR reported. Chronic wasting is still rare in Minnesota, but its potential spread is a worry for state conservation officials who oversee Minnesota’s $1 billion annual deer-hunting industry.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Construction will begin next year for a veterans’ nursing home near the Gulf Coast. The 100-bed facility will be in the Tradition development north of Gulfport. News outlets reported that the executive director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board, Stacey Pickering, spoke at a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday. He said the state has 189,000 veterans and 26% of them live in the three coastal counties. The closest veterans’ home to the coast is in Collins, about 2 hours away. Pickering said the state Legislature agreed to provide $16 million to go with a federal grant of $29.3 million to build the center.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it has signed a lease for permanent office space at a building in downtown Kansas City for two of its research agencies. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a news release Thursday that signing the lease is an important next step for the agencies’ efficiency, effectiveness and service to customers. The USDA announced plans in June to move roughly 550 employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture by the end of September to the Kansas City area. The announcement of the new office space comes amid charges from a federal employees union that the move has left them critically understaffed, saying it will take years to hire replacements for the highly specialized positions.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: With snow on the ground in Montana, fire agencies from across the state are sending 20 engines and 72 firefighters to California to help battle wildfires there. Gov. Steve Bullock approved sending crews as part of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. About 18 agencies are sending personnel and equipment for 14-day deployments. Flathead County Fire Services Manager Lincoln Chute and Helena firefighter Owen Koeppen said the work will allow Montana firefighters to gain experience, knowledge and skills they can use at home. Helena Assistant Fire Chief Mike Chambers said six firefighters are going to California and the rest of the department will fill in and maybe work some overtime to cover shifts. Blazes fanned by strong winds are burning in northern and southern California, destroying homes and threatening others, forcing thousands of people to evacuate\n\nNebraska\n\nMaxwell: The Nebraska State Patrol said troopers have seized 91 pounds of marijuana found in a sport utility vehicle during a traffic stop on Interstate 80 near Maxwell. The patrol said the stop happened Tuesday night when the driver of the SUV was pulled over on suspicion of having an obscured license plate. During the stop, a police drug dog indicated the presence of drugs in the vehicle, and a search turned up the marijuana, which was concealed in bags in the SUV’s cargo area. The 36-year-old driver and 61-year-old passenger, both from Kansas City, Missouri, were arrested, as was a 34-year-old passenger from Mexico, on suspicion of various drug violations.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists are suing the Trump administration to try to block mining exploration in Nevada they said would wipe out the only known population of a desert wildflower. The Center for Biological Diversity filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this month to list Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species. The new lawsuit accuses the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations requiring a formal environmental review and public comment on any land disturbances larger than 5 acres. BLM lists one of the exploration projects as 4.98 acres and the other as 4.04 acres in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County about 120 miles southeast of Reno, where a lithium and boron mine is planned. Bureau spokesman Rudy Evenson said the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation. But he said it “takes the protection of this species seriously and is committed to the deliberate process to ensure it is protected.” The delicate wildflower – typically about 2 feet tall with white to cream to yellow blooms – plays an integral role in the desert ecosystem by stabilizing soils and dispersing seeds, the lawsuit said. The estimated 20,000 to 43,000 individual plants that remain are found only in specific soil conditions on 21 acres spread across 3 square miles of Nevada in a narrow elevation band between 5,960 and 6,200 feet, according to the petition filed Oct. 7 seeking protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A watchdog report based on a review of child fatalities called on New Hampshire’s child protection agency to address systemic problems, including an outdated filing system, strained relationships with other agencies and internal biases among staff members. The Office of the Child Advocate was created in 2017 as part of a larger effort to reform the state’s Division of Children, Youth and Families. It released a report this week based on a monthslong review of six cases that focused not on the actions of particular individuals, but rather the environment in which they occurred. Child Advocate Moira O’Neill said the goal is to shift from “blame and shame” to system accountability. DCYF officials noted the report raises several long-standing issues that are already are being addressed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Transportation Security Administration agents at Newark Liberty Airport uncovered a more decorative than deadly item when they checked a passenger’s carry-on. Agents on Tuesday thought there was a gun in the bag when they put it through the X-ray machine. However, a closer inspection revealed a gun-shaped toilet paper roller. The realistic replica gun was designed to spin paper instead of bullets. Travelers are not permitted to bring real or replica firearms through security checkpoints. TSA said it gave the man the option to place it in a checked bag, hand it off to a companion or surrender it. He decided to give it to the TSA.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHolloman Air Force Base: The Air Force said a pilot successfully ejected from an F-16 before the fighter crashed in southern New Mexico during a training flight. Holloman Air Force Base officials said the F-16 assigned to the 49th Wing at the base crashed Tuesday night about 80 miles southeast of the base. Officials said in a statement that the pilot was taken to a hospital for treatment, but it did not provide information on any injuries to the pilot, whose identity was not released. The statement said a board of officers will investigate the crash and that its cause wasn’t determined immediately.\n\nNew York\n\nRotterdam: A dog hit by a car in upstate New York rode for 45 minutes wedged between the broken bumper and the grille before the driver realized she was carrying an injured passenger. Coco the Shiba inu was being treated for a fractured elbow after being struck Monday morning in Albany. Rotterdam Police Lt. Jeffrey Collins said the driver knew she hit something and noticed the car’s damage but didn’t see the dog at first. She drove about 15 miles to Rotterdam before hearing noises and stopping to recheck her car’s front end. She called 911 after she saw the dog gazing from below the license plate. A Schenectady veterinary clinic worker told WNYT-TV that 16-pound Coco “fit perfectly” in the space behind the bumper and was lucky to be alive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A gleaming abstract sculpture that’s lit from within will be the centerpiece of a new park honoring the contributions of African Americans to North Carolina that has been in the planning stages for more than a decade. The state Historical Commission approved the new design for Freedom Park on Wednesday. The park will be located on a 1-acre site between the state legislature and the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh. Inspirational quotes from African Americans from North Carolina will be engraved on walls along walkways that lead to the 48-foot-tall Beacon of Freedom sculpture. Plans for the park began in 2002, and an architect was chosen in 2004. But the Great Recession dampened fundraising, and supporters learned that potential donors found the design’s focus on slavery too depressing, board member Reginald Hodges said Wednesday. The design includes no monuments; the walls carry no quotes from people outside North Carolina. The walls will be made of precast concrete and tinted to resemble the red clay of North Carolina, said architect Michael Stevenson of Perkins and Will. One quote located in a prominent place comes from John H. Wheeler, president of Mechanics & Farmers Bank from 1952 to 1978 and a founder of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs: “The battle for freedom begins every morning.” A groundbreaking for the park is planned for December. Stevenson estimated that completing it will take about a year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Water Commission has unveiled a new interactive mapping tool that provides information on potential flooding in the state. State risk map coordinator Laura Horner said the map shows where flooding might occur and to what extent it could happen in various scenarios. The Bismarck Tribune reported that the North Dakota Risk Assessment Mapservice was on display Wednesday at the Bismarck Event Center. The tool is intended to help people make informed decisions about flood protection and provide resources to community leaders who want to keep citizens safe. It uses base-level engineering that combines elevation data with advancements in modeling technology. The state partnered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the project.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringfield: The 178th Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard is set to get its first female commander. Col. Kimberly Fitzgerald is scheduled to assume duties as commander of the 178th Wing from Col. Gregg Hesterman during a ceremony Sunday at the Springfield Air National Guard Base. Fitzgerald is currently the vice commander of the 178th Wing. She has 26 years of service including a total of more than 4,000 flight hours as a KC-135 navigator, a KC-135 pilot, MQ-1 Predator pilot, and MQ-9 Reaper pilot. She transferred to the 178th Wing in 2011 and served as the 162nd Flying Squadron commander and Mission Support Group commander before taking on the role of vice commander. Hesterman will serve as the director of staff for the Ohio National Guard.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma judge on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a Democratic state lawmaker and gun safety advocates to block a new law that will allow most people in the state to carry a firearm in public without a background check or training. Oklahoma County District Judge Don Andrews rejected a request by Oklahoma City Democratic Rep. Jason Lowe for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the “permitless carry” law from taking effect on Friday. Lowe’s attorney, Melanie Rughani, argued that the bill violated the state’s constitutional single-subject rule that requires bills to deal with only one topic. But the judge said Rughani failed to prove that the law taking effect would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. Lowe promised to appeal the judge’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. According to the National Rifle Association, at least 14 states have approved some version of permitless carry.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Wildland firefighters worked to contain blazes across Western Oregon as windy conditions and low humidity gripped the state. KVAL reported strong east winds caused wildfire danger levels to climb, the Coos Forest Protective Association said Wednesday. The agency said southwestern Oregon is experiencing a similar weather pattern as California, where multiple fires have destroyed homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The Coos Forest Protective Association responded to four fires since Sunday, one of which the agency said was power-line related. Firefighters in Lane County have brought two fires that started Tuesday under control. Firefighters also contained a small blaze near Eagle Point on Tuesday. Firefighters continue to work a small fire in Josephine County that started Saturday. Fire crews are also working to control two somewhat larger fires in northwest Oregon east of Molalla and near Detroit. No injuries have been reported and no structures have been reported destroyed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A proposal to allow hunting on three Sundays a year in Pennsylvania is on its way to the state Senate for a final vote. The House voted 144-54 on Wednesday for the bill that would also require a landowner’s written permission. The bill would permit Sunday hunting one day during rifle deer season, one during statewide archery deer season and a third day the Game Commission would select. It also would make it easier for wardens to enforce the anti-trespassing law.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Public utilities regulators said a natural gas outage that affected more than 7,000 customers during a particularly cold spell last winter was caused by low pressure in a pipeline. The 74-page Division of Public Utilities and Carriers report released Wednesday blamed the low pressure on high demand for gas driven by low temperatures; failure of a power system at a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporization facility in Providence; and a malfunctioning valve at a meter station in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The agency said it will oppose any efforts by National Grid to recover the $25 million in costs related to the outage from ratepayers. Thousands of residents of Newport and Middletown went without gas or heat for nearly a week last January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJoint Base Charleston: Melania Trump and Karen Pence traveled to South Carolina on Wednesday to get briefings about some of the military’s emergency preparedness and humanitarian efforts in a state where both are often needed because of active hurricane seasons. During a few hours in and around Joint Base Charleston, where several branches of the military have operations, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence were updated by a handful of agencies, whose officials described how they mobilize federal resources before and after natural disasters. That often means natural disasters in South Carolina, where the coast was evacuated earlier this year as Hurricane Dorian swirled in the Atlantic Ocean. Skirting the Carolina coast just after Labor Day, Dorian’s high winds and rain spun off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles. Earlier, at an elementary school just off the base, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence also met with fifth-grade students participating in the Red Cross Pillowcase Project, which helps children mentally and physically prepare for natural disasters. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence have previously toured military installations together, including North Carolina’s Fort Bragg earlier this year. To close out their South Carolina trip, both women made remarks to several hundred service members and their families on the base, thanking them for serving the country. Mrs. Pence reminded the crowd of the importance of military spouses and families, and Mrs. Trump focused on heralding the strength of the U.S. military.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Authorities have been staking out a cornfield in northern Sioux Falls for more than 24 hours, waiting out a loose, recluse moose that has taken shelter in the field near 60th Street North and Marion Road. \"He kind of disappeared on us. We think he's napping,\" said Julie DeJong, the animal control supervisor. Animal Control responded to the report around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Game, Fish and Parks and South Dakota Highway Patrol also are involved in the situation. There were also reports of a moose in Hartford over the weekend, DeJong said, though she didn't know if this was the same moose. Authorities will continue to monitor the cornfield until the moose comes out, DeJong said. When he does come out, the moose will either wander out of town and authorities will leave it alone or, if it moves closer to Sioux Falls, authorities will try to contain him, sedate him and move him outside of the city. There have been two other instances of a moose on the loose in the Sioux Falls area within recent years. The two were weeks apart in fall 2016 when a female and then a male wandered into Brandon and the Sioux Falls area. October and November are part of the mating season for moose. The moose could have come from northern Minnesota or from North Dakota, DeJong said. For now, the moose is taking its time, likely eating corn in the field, as authorities wait it out, DeJong said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country star and Grammy winner Marty Stuart will be the celebrity guest on the annual CSX Santa Train, which visits towns in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia in November to hand out gifts for families. The holiday train, which has run every year since 1942, makes a dozen stops in three states, starting in Shelby, Kentucky, and ending in Kingsport, Tennessee, on Nov. 23. The train delivers food, toys and winter clothing on the 110-mile trip. Stuart, who was recently prominently featured in Ken Burns’ “Country Music” PBS documentary, has released 18 studio albums. Born in Mississippi, Stuart started his career playing bluegrass with legend Lester Flatt and later in Johnny Cash’s band. He’s also a photographer and is planning to open a music museum in Mississippi.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A woman is accused of spraying blood and urine on security guards and paintings of governors at the state Capitol. According to an affidavit, Amber Lynette Green was arrested Monday after spraying a Texas Department of Public Safety corporal and another employee with “an unknown liquid in a bottle.” Green sprayed the liquid on paintings of governors in the Capitol rotunda before telling the corporal “there was blood and urine in the bottle.” The officer said he could smell urine. The officer tried to arrest Green, but she ran from the Capitol grounds. Department of Public Safety officers arrested her. Green was charged with harassment of a public servant, evading arrest and other counts. She was booked into Travis County Jail. Bail was set at $25,000.\n\nUtah\n\nBrigham City: Officials in a Utah community say they have received “more than a few” complaints about a family’s Halloween display that includes a guillotine chopping off the heads of baby dolls. However, the city attorney for Brigham City, Michael Christiansen, said the display isn’t a public nuisance under the city code even though “it’s distasteful to some.” KUTV-TV reported that In addition to the guillotine, the lawn display also includes a bloody nurse standing over a baby incubator containing angry-looking babies and baby parts. Julie Bawden said her family’s annual Halloween displays are just intended “to be spooky and fun.” Neighbor Claudia Perry said she objects to the display, saying it’s too much. In Perry’s words, “how far are they going to go? And where are we going to stop?”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Officials said a dam previously deemed a public safety hazard has been demolished. The Dunklee Pond Dam in Rutland came down Wednesday. The Rutland Herald reported that the city and state have been looking at removing the dam since at least 2016. In August, city officials said the structure was one bad rainstorm away from complete failure, which would be compounded by the dam’s massive sediment buildup. Houses downstream were evacuated in early 2017 when erosion from a sudden rainstorm triggered fears it might fail. The Board of Alderman declared it a public safety hazard last year. A no-bid contract for emergency measures was approved last week after a dam retaining wall shifted 3 ½ inches following an Oct. 17 storm.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The Virginian-Pilot reported Thursday that a juvenile humpback whale washed up dead on the north end of Virginia Beach. The spot is along the Atlantic Ocean and just south of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The whale might have been the same animal that someone spotted floating near the bay’s mouth earlier in the week. Alexander Costidis of the Virginia Aquarium said the whale was “pretty decomposed.” He said the whale was tossed around in the waves so much that there wasn’t much left inside the animal to test for a cause of death. But he said that a ship strike was unlikely. The mammal was 26 feet long and was probably between 1 and 3 years old.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court said in a split decision that the state cannot be held at fault for an accident that caused the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River to collapse in 2013. A truck carrying an oversized load struck the overhead support beams of the bridge, causing the structure to fall into the water. No one was killed, but three people in two vehicles plunged into the water. The state sued the Canadian trucking company, Mullen Trucking 2005 Ltd. The company countersued, saying the state was partially at fault and should have to pay some of the damages. Mullen Trucking said the state was negligent in issuing a permit for the load and in maintaining the bridge. In a 5-4 decision, the court Thursday pointed to a state law that said vehicle owners or operators must exercise due care in making sure their vehicles can pass under a structure, and that the state can’t be held liable for damages caused by an overheight vehicle. The dissenting justices said the state could not be found liable under that law, but that it still could be at fault if it failed to properly maintain the bridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Regulators said a state-record chain pickerel was caught in Preston County. The Division of Natural Resources said in a news release that Matt Born of Reedsville used an in-line spinner to catch the fish Oct. 13 at Upper Deckers Lake. The fish measured a record 27.87 inches, besting the record of 27.75-inches caught by Steven Demma at Tuckahoe Lake in 2001. The chain pickerel is a member of the pike family.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A large storm system moving through the Midwest delivered some early season snow to much of Wisconsin. As much as 6 inches of snow was expected in the southern part of the state. Forecasters expected lesser amounts elsewhere, including near Lake Michigan. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory Thursday from northeastern Wisconsin to southern counties. Falling snow slowed the morning commute. In Milwaukee County, the interstate system was slick. Temperatures Thursday night were expected to drop to the 20s.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Wildlife managers have authorized 375 permits for this year’s elk hunt at Grand Teton National Park, which begins Saturday. They will allow hunting in an area mainly east of U.S. Highway 89 in the southeast part of Grand Teton in western Wyoming. Hunting in two different portions of the hunt area will end on Nov. 25 and Dec. 8. Hunting typically isn’t allowed in national parks but the 1950 law authorizing Grand Teton allows elk hunting in the park. Park officials call the hunt an “elk reduction program” intended to cull animals in the Jackson elk herd. Hunters must abide by several rules that often don’t apply outside the park. They include requirements to carry bear spray and use nonlead ammunition", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/21/news-around-states/39791115/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nJasper: Live stand-ins for Santa’s reindeer won’t be allowed in the state this year, as part of the state’s precautions against a deadly deer disease. So far, there hasn’t been any chronic wasting disease in Alabama, and the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources wants to keep it that way. The Daily Mountain Eagle reports that the department’s deputy commissioner told the Rotary Club of Jasper on Tuesday that reindeer typically arrive days before a show and might bring in the disease. Ed Poolos of Jasper told the group that reindeer already in the state can stay. Chronic wasting disease is highly infectious and caused by malformed proteins called prions. Animals can spread those for a year or two before symptoms show.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: At least 14 cities in Alaska have employed police officers whose criminal records should have prevented them from being hired under state law, according to The Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica. The news organizations reported Saturday that they found more than 34 officers who should have been ineligible for these jobs. They said that In all but three cases, the police hires were never reported by the city governments to the state’s Department of Public Safety, as required. In eight additional communities, local tribal governments have hired tribal police officers convicted of domestic violence or sex crimes. All 42 of these tribal and city police officers have rap sheets that would prevent them from being hired by the Anchorage Police Department and its urban peers, as Alaska state troopers or even as private security guards most anywhere else in the United States. Many remain on the job.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s 1950s adobe home is being listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service approved Arizona’s nomination of the house for placement on the register, which the office described as the nation’s list of properties considered worthy of preservation. The home was originally in Paradise Valley but was relocated in 2009 to a Tempe park for use by the Sandra Day O’Connor Institute. O’Connor lived in the home from 1958 until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan named the state appellate judge and former legislative leader to the Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Small Business Administration says $10.8 million in disaster assistance loans have been made in Arkansas. SBA director Tanya Garfield in Sacramento, California, said Friday that the loans are to businesses and residents to help rebuild and recover from severe storms and flooding that inundated western, central and southeastern Arkansas from May 21-June 14. Businesses and residents in Arkansas, Conway, Crawford, Desha, Faulkner, Jefferson, Lincoln, Logan, Perry, Pope, Pulaski, Sebastian and Yell counties who have damage from the storms or flooding can register for the loans through Aug. 7. Interest rates can be as low as 4% for businesses, 2.75% for private nonprofit organizations and 1.938% for homeowners and renters with terms up to 30 years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The agency overseeing the state’s legal marijuana market is struggling to hire sufficient staff and set an overall strategy for the nation’s largest cannabis economy, an audit found. About two-thirds of the 219 staff positions authorized for the Bureau of Cannabis Control remain unfilled, according to an audit by the state Finance Department. A shortage of staff in the enforcement unit is hindering the agency’s ability to conduct investigations. The problems outlined in the audit provide a backstory to the uneven rollout of the state’s legal pot market, which kicked off sales on Jan. 1, 2018. By just about any measure, California’s effort to transform its longstanding illegal and medicinal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry remains a work in progress.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Some people stayed cool on their commutes by tubing down a snow-fed creek. The Daily Camera reports that 1,000 people participated in the 12th annual Tube to Work Day on Friday, one of the hottest days of the year. The event is aimed at promoting alternative transportation and celebrating the city’s quirkiness. Organizers bill it as the “world’s greatest traffic jam.” Television helicopter footage showed people going through mild rapids as they made their way down Boulder Creek in tubes, including some dressed in suits. People gathered on bridges over the creek to watch. The event was delayed this year until the water subsided to safe levels following a winter of plentiful snow in the mountains.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: A new agreement will allow graduates from two community colleges to easily transfer to Quinnipiac University. The president of Gateway Community College in New Haven and Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport has reached an agreement with Quinnipiac’s president, guaranteeing Gateway and Housatonic graduates are admitted into a bachelor’s degree program as third-year students. They must have graduated from the state-run community colleges with a minimum grade0point average of 3.0 and an associate degree in arts or an associate degree in science in business, engineering science, nursing or allied health. The students must also satisfy other transfer admission requirements at the private university and requirements for their major.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Sweltering temperatures reached near-record levels Saturday with highs of 96 in Wilmington and 98 in Georgetown — two locations where the National Weather Service collects official data. The record high temperature on July 20 in Wilmington is 100, set in 1895. Georgetown’s record-setting day, where temperatures also hit 100, came in 1977. But the heat index, which takes into account temperature and humidity, reached 109 in Wilmington and 111 in Georgetown. The weather service does not keep heat index records. A reprieve from the warm weather should come Monday as a colder front moves in and pushes out the hot and humid air mass that has lingered over the area since Wednesday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Multiple firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion while trying to put out an apartment fire in Southwest, D.C. on Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services crews responded to a seventh-floor apartment fire in the 200 block of I Street. Officials reported smoke conditions on several floors and many residents were evacuated from the building. The fire was put out quickly. Two civilians were taken to a hospital for evaluation and two firefighters were taken for heat exhaustion.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A retired 68-year-old Tennessee banker has won Key West’s Hemingway Look-Alike Contest on his eighth attempt. Joe Maxey of Cedar Hill triumphed Saturday night at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, a hangout of Ernest Hemingway during his Key West residence in the 1930s. A judging panel of former winners chose Maxey from 142 white-bearded contenders who competed in two preliminary rounds and Saturday’s finals. Maxey said he loves Hemingway’s writing and shares the author’s fondness for mojitos and women. During his Key West years, Hemingway penned literary classics including “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “To Have and Have Not.” The contest is a highlight of the annual Hemingway Days festival that honors the author’s literary legacy and adventurous lifestyle. The celebration ends Sunday, the 120th anniversary of his birth.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A private room that breastfeeding mothers can use to pump breast milk has opened in a building near the Capitol. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports the lactation room in the James H. “Sloppy” Floyd Building – which houses state agencies and a cafeteria – is the second in state offices in downtown Atlanta. Another site at a different state building has been open for six years and averages about 355 visits per month. The new room is open to state employees with a badge, but visitors can access the room through security staff. Its opening came after state Sen. Jen Jordan, an Atlanta Democrat, introduced legislation requiring a lactation room be provided at the Capitol. The legislation stalled, but Republican Gov. Brian Kemp helped secure the room nearby.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A newly appointed, taxpayer-funded attorney representing a former prosecutor wants to delay her trial on bank fraud and identity theft charges. Gary Singh was appointed to represent Katherine Kealoha after her former taxpayer-funded attorney asked to withdraw from the case. Kealoha and her retired police chief husband were convicted last month of conspiracy in a plot to frame her uncle. Their fraud and identity theft trial is scheduled for October At a hearing Thursday, Singh said he needs more time. The timing of that trial will affect scheduling for another trial faced by Katherine Kealoha with her pain physician brother on drug-dealing charges. U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright wants to Singh to consult with other attorneys involved about new trial dates.\n\nIdaho\n\nJerome: A music festival in southern Idaho has been canceled because organizers say they feared potential raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The music festival called the El Tour de Idaho de Los Inquietos was supposed to take place last Saturday. Event organizers with the Colombia Event Center posted the cancellation notice on Facebook. Leo Morales of ACLU of Idaho said he couldn’t confirm that any Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in southern Idaho, but he said community members were panicked. Jerome City Police Dan Hall said he didn’t have information about ICE agents in the area. Hall said the agency is not required to tell local law enforcement that it is conducting raids. But he did say ICE would inform local police if its activity involves a case that police are already working. Ticket-holders were told to get refunds from where they purchased tickets.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Efforts to organize an open-water swim on the Chicago River this fall will be delayed by at least one year. Doug McConnell and his co-organizer Don Macdonald wanted to coordinate a 2.4-mile swim on the Chicago River in September. But McConnell says convincing the relevant city authorities to allow the swimming has proved to be tougher than anticipated. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events informed the team last week that they would need to postpone their swim. The organizers’ new target for the swim is September 2020. McConnell says the swim would raise money for Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine to conduct research for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The city where Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is mayor is updating its police officers’ body camera technology following the recent fatal police shooting of a black man. Police Sgt. Ryan O’ Neill fatally shot Eric Logan on June 16, but the incident wasn’t captured on video because his body camera wasn’t activated. The shooting sparked protests, prompting Buttigieg to leave the campaign trail for several days to answer questions about public safety and race. O’Neill resigned from the department last week. The South Bend Tribune reports that the technology upgrades will mean officers’ body cameras can be activated manually or automatically when a squad car door is opened. And soon, sensors will activate the cameras when an officer’s gun when it is drawn from the holster.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Officials have announced new inspection rules for pigs that will be shown at the Iowa State Fair. A state Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship news release says the additional exhibition requirements are designed to promote biosecurity and animal health as African swine fever continues to spread across China and other parts of Asia and Europe. All pigs must be individually inspected and identified on a certificate of veterinary inspection that was completed within seven days of the fair, which runs Aug. 8-18. A veterinarian will inspect all pigs as they arrive at the fairgrounds before they are unloaded or mixed with other livestock. Biosecurity concerns led organizers to cancel the World Pork Expo scheduled for last month at the fairgrounds. The National Pork Producers Council says African swine fever affects only pigs and presents no human health or food safety risks. There is no vaccine to treat the disease.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Electric charging stations have been introduced at the Topeka, Lawrence and Towanda services areas on the Kansas Turnpike. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Gov. Laura Kelly announced the charging station additions Wednesday, calling them “a game-changer” for electric vehicle drivers. The Topeka Service Area, similar to the ones in Lawrence and Towanda, has three charging stations. The charging station additions came as a result of an alliance between the Kansas Turnpike Authority, Westar Energy and Kansas City Power and Light. Turnpike officials say the charging stations will help to eradicate “range anxiety,” or the concern an electric car battery will run out of power before reaching a destination. Westar Energy officials say manufacturers expect to spend around $500 billion in the next eight years on electric car development.\n\nKentucky\n\nHenderson: The city’s downtown experienced a full-on military assault Thursday night — complete with a forced building entry, flash-bang grenade explosions, fake gunfire and troops being whisked away under the cover of darkness in Black Hawk helicopters. Fortunately, it was all friendly U.S. forces carrying out a supervised training exercise in cooperation with local officials. There was some minor collateral damage, though. When the troops stormed the old, empty Immanuel Baptist Temple church building on Second Street that is owned by the city, Holy Name School next door got a little roughed up by the helicopter rotor wash.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State officials say high water means people are seeing more alligators than usual, and feeding them is dangerous. State wildlife officials sent out a news release during the week, and Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted about the subject Friday. The governor wrote, “It feels like we shouldn’t have to say this, y’all. But please don’t feed the alligators.” Wildlife biologists say feeding gators makes them view people as an easy food source, increasing the chance that they will bite someone. The statement from the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries notes that throwing fish scraps into the water or leaving them on shore is a bad idea for the same reason. It says fish scraps, like other garbage, should go into garbage cans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: America’s harvest of scallops is increasing to near-record levels at a time when the shellfish are in high demand. Sea scallops, harvested mostly by boats from the cold Atlantic Ocean, are the target of one of the most valuable fisheries in America. New data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the harvest topped 58.2 million pounds last year, the highest total since 2011 and the fifth-highest in history according to NOAA statistics dating to 1945. The availability of scallops for consumers hasn’t changed as the U.S. harvest has long been supplemented by foreign sources. Prices to consumers have also held about steady. NOAA says American scallops were worth $532 9 million at the docks last year. That’s the third-highest figure.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: Roller coaster riders were stuck atop a hill for nearly two hours at a Six Flags amusement park when the ride malfunctioned. News outlets quote Six Flags America spokeswoman Denise Stokes as saying the ride came to a stop at the top of the lift hill on the Firebird ride Thursday night. All guests were escorted safely off the ride, but officials said passengers had to wait for nearly two hours on the floorless coaster as the park followed safety procedures. Six Flags officials told news outlets the ride will remain closed while it undergoes an inspection. WJZ reports this is the third time in the past three years that people have been removed from one ride or another at the park.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: A family fishing in Cape Cod Bay had an up close and personal encounter with a great white shark that leaped out of the water to snatch a fish they had caught right off the line. Doug Nelson of Franklin, who caught the leaping shark on video on Saturday, told New England Cable News it “gave us a pretty good scare.” His son, Jack, can be seen on the video jumping back as the shark breaches the water’s surface. The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy confirmed it was a great white, as did Marc Costa, captain of the Columbia Sportfishing vessel. Costa said the boat was about three miles west of Great Island in Wellfleet when the shark made its leap.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The John Ball Zoo is closing a month early this season to work on improvements. Over the next five years, zoo officials are hoping to widen the entryway to enhance accessibility and build an 18-acre playground. The parking lot will also move from the front to the rear of the zoo to make room for the playground. Peter D’Arienzo, who heads the zoo, tells WOOD-TV the zoo is also planning to offer annual exhibits. The zoo recently added toucans, a spider monkey and the popular red pandas. The zoo draws nearly 500,000 people each year. It opened 128 years ago, making it the nation’s 10th-oldest zoo.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State conservation officials say there’s a small, but noticeable increase in loon deaths and the likely cause is West Nile virus. The Department of Natural Resources says the virus was confirmed as the cause of death in two of three loons from northeastern Minnesota earlier this month. Minnesota Public Radio News says the agency is asking lake property owners and others using the lakes to contact a wildlife office if they see two or more dead loons with no obvious injury or cause of death. West Nile was first confirmed in Minnesota in 2002. The virus is spread through mosquito bites. Most people and animals fight off the virus and develop antibodies against future infection. The DNR says loons and crows, however, are especially susceptible to the infection.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: Elvis Presley fans will soon be able to rent bicycles to pedal around in the city where he was born. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports that a local entrepreneur, Ethan Nolan, is starting a bike rental service in Tupelo. It is called King City Cycles. Nolan belongs to a bicycle club and says rentals will make downtown more attractive to locals and tourists alike. Tupelo attracts big crowds for its annual Elvis Festival. People will rent bikes using a smartphone app, and the app will track the bikes’ location to guard against thefts. Biloxi is among the Mississippi cities that have had bicycle rental services.\n\nMissouri\n\nBolivar: A woman who knows her snakes encountered a weird one while riding her bicycle on the Frisco Highline Trail. Near one of the first bridges on the southbound route, Christy Dablemont, 47, rode past the snake, then turned around for a closer look. The snake was a venomous copperhead, but with unusual markings down its back. Instead of “Hershey’s Kisses” markings along its side, the snake’s back was mostly a pattern of bronze-colored lines. Dablemont, who worked for 16 years as a wildlife interpreter at Pomme de Terre State Park, said it was the most unusual Missouri snake she has ever encountered. After photographing the snake, she left it to continue sunning along the side of the trail, which runs between Springfield and Bolivar. She noted that the venomous snake’s unusual appearance is a good reminder for people to leave wild snakes alone, especially if you don’t know what it is.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nonprofit group trying to create the nation’s largest nature reserve in central Montana is planning a buffalo hunt on its land later this year. American Prairie Reserve officials say the quota will be 20 based on the approximately 800 bison in the privately owned herd. They will hold a drawing on Aug. 1 in which 16 people will be randomly selected. Six tags will go to residents who live near the reserve, four to Montana residents, four to members of the Fort Peck, Fort Belknap or Rocky Boy tribes and two more to the general public. The fee is $300. Four tags will be donated to local charities for fundraising. Reserve superintendent Damien Austin says limited hunts serve as a management tool to check the bison population.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials are warning those in Douglas County to take precautions after West Nile virus was found in mosquitoes in the county. The Douglas County Health Department says in a news release that four local mosquito pools at two locations have tested positive for the mosquito-borne illness. The pools are located at Seymour L. Smith Park in Ralston and Zorinsky Lake Park in western Omaha. The department says high populations of mosquitoes have been reported since May. Residents are urged to apply mosquito repellant and wear long-sleeved shirts, pants and socks and shoes, particularly at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. Residents should also remove standing water to prevent mosquito breeding. Those who contract West Nile can suffer symptoms ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to death.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe is the fullest it has been in nearly two decades. Officials say the alpine lake on the California-Nevada border is approaching the legal limit after snowmelt from a stormy winter left enough water to potentially last through three summers of drought. For three weeks, Tahoe has been within an inch of its maximum allowed surface elevation of 6,229.1 feet above sea level, It crept to within a half-inch earlier this week. Chad Blanchard, a federal water master in Reno responsible for managing the water, told the Reno Gazette-Journal it is the longest he’s seen the lake stay that high for so long. Lake Tahoe, the second-deepest lake in the U.S. at about 1,645 feet, typically holds enough water to cover the entire state of California with 14 inches of the wet stuff. Only Oregon’s Crater Lake is deeper.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A Republican lawmaker is standing by comments made on social media that slavery was motivated by economics rather than racism, even as he was criticized by his own party. In a Facebook exchange with a former lawmaker, state Rep. Werner Horn wrote that owning slaves didn’t necessarily make someone a racist. He was responding to the former lawmaker’s comment questioning how President Donald Trump could be the most racist president when other presidents owned slaves. Horn on Saturday defended his comments that slavery was a business decision but said he was referring to the 17th and 18th centuries. By the 19th century, he said, racism was used to maintain slavery. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu called Horn’s comments racist and said the “legislature would be better off without” him.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack:Nearly two dozen protesters gathered Saturday outside the Bergen County Jail demanding that air conditioners that had been malfunctioning for weeks be fixed and warned that the weekend’s scorching temperatures create dangerous conditions for inmates. Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton says that the air conditioners were all working after two malfunctioned Friday night. Before Friday, the jail had been experiencing air conditioning problems for weeks and maintenance staff was working on installing replacement condensers. All those repairs, Cureton said, have been completed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlamogordo: Lincoln National Forest is undertaking a multiyear endeavor of creating a forest plan revision. This process is in its beginning stages and public input is needed on some criteria. Lincoln National Forest is wanting to hear from the public about its Draft Wilderness Inventory Criteria and Draft Wilderness Evaluation Criteria. Only public forest system land will be considered for wilderness designation. Privately-owned land will be exempt from wilderness designation, Lincoln National Forest Spokeswoman Laura Rabon says. Public comments must be submitted by July 31, either by email at LNF_FPR_comments@fs.fed.us or by mail to Lincoln National Forest, Attn.: Plan Revision, 3463 Las Palomas Road, Alamogordo, NM, 88310..\n\nNew York\n\nGrahamsville: A rare dragonfly has been spotted near a reservoir in the Catskills. A New York City Department of Environmental Protection field ecologist recently found a southern pygmy clubtail dragonfly living along a tributary to the city’s Rondout Reservoir. The city agency says the species is considered critically imperiled in New York. It can only survive and reproduce in clear, clean waters, making them an indicator of water quality. DEP ecologist Frank Beres says the dragonfly hopped on his finger and allowed him to take several photos before flying off. The species’ population in New York and the Northeast has reportedly been dwindling for years.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCandler:Buncombe County will get its first state park, where residents will get a front-row seat for viewing Mount Pisgah and watching wildlife, hiking ridge lines, and maybe even take in a horseback ride. Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law SB 535 on Friday, authorizing the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to create Pisgah View State Park, which will be roughly 1,600 acres, sitting mostly in Candler, with a small parcel in Haywood County. Earlier in the month the governor also signed into law two bills creating the Northern Peaks State Trail in Watauga and Ashe counties, the Wilderness Gateway State Trail in the South Mountains range in McDowell, Rutherford, Burke and Catawba counties, and the Overmountain Victory State Trail reaching across Avery, Mitchell, McDowell, Burke, Rutherford, Polk, Caldwell, Wilkes and Surry counties.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nEpping: The state’s Health Department says more than 12,000 gallons of oilfield wastewater has spilled from a pipeline in Williams County, impacting an unknown amount of pastureland. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says the pipeline operator, Polar Midstream LLC, reported the produced water spill Thursday. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess says state regulators are investing the spill about 3 miles southwest of Epping. He says some of the spill was contained to a well pad. Polar Midstream also reported a 21,000-gallon produced water spill on July. 14 near Williston. Regulators say some of that spill entered an unnamed tributary to the Missouri River.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21. The new law will take effect in October after Gov. Mike DeWine signed it last week. Ohio is one of 18 states that have raised the minimum age for purchasing cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. The new law also applies to rolling papers, filters and other smoking and vaping accessories. National statistics show Ohio has one of the highest rates of adult smokers at just over 21%. Backers of the new law say the goal is to prevent children from starting to smoke.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s rainy spring has provided an ideal environment for ticks. That could be bad news for people and their pets because the pathogens many ticks carry can cause serious diseases. The risk of getting a tick bite isn’t limited to hikers and campers in the woods. Plenty of the bloodsuckers live in urban parks and neighborhoods. Will Hagenbuck, head park naturalist at the Oklahoma City park system, says park visitors can avoid most of the ticks by staying on the trails, but that’s no guarantee. Tick-borne diseases can be dangerous, causing everything from a food allergy to red meat to miscarriage to death. Look behind ears, at the collar line on the back of the neck, armpits, joints, waist and groin, and on your socks and shoes. Adults may be easy to spot, but nymphs might look like a freckle, he said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Amazon on Friday kicked off a hiring spree for more than 800 positions at its packing and shipping warehouse. The Seattle e-commerce giant is taking a staggered approach to fill its earlier promised target of about 1,000 jobs at the approximately 1-million-square-foot outpost. The warehouse opens in August. Workers can expect to pack and ship larger products including sports equipment, gardening tools and patio furniture. Amazon has adopted a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Oregon’s minimum wage in the Salem area rose to $11.25 on July 1 and will increase to $13.50 in 2022 under state legislation enacted in 2016. The company offers employee benefits such as up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave. Candidates for the Salem jobs have to be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or equivalent. Applicants can go online at www.amazon.com/salemjobs or text SALEMNOW to 77088.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: Mayor Wally Scott has reversed course and says he will allow the LGBTQ rainbow flag to fly over City Hall for the first time. Scott last week called off a scheduled ceremony to raise the “pride flag,” calling it a political symbol. But the Reading Eagle reports that Scott posted a video on his Facebook page Saturday saying he had changed his mind. Scott says his change of heart came after a “very prominent woman” he would not name visited him and spoke to him about her experience of realizing she was gay and telling her mother.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers are praising the signing of legislation that establishes guidelines for a diversion program within the Superior Court. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed the legislation Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey says it’s another step forward for criminal justice reform because the program will offer supervision and services instead of incarceration. McCaffrey of Warwick sponsored the legislation, along with Rep. Robert Jacquard, D-Cranston, in the House. Jacquard says it’s imperative that the state helps people with addiction issues get healthy rather than incarcerating them at great cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: An extremely rare albino alligator that lived at the South Carolina Aquarium has died. The aquarium posted on its Facebook page that the 22-year-old alligator named Alabaster died Friday morning. He had lived at the aquarium since 2009. South Carolina Aquarium spokeswoman Caroline Morris tells The Post and Courier that Alabaster was believed to be one of about 50 albino gators in the world. Staff at the aquarium said they noticed Alabaster showing signs of infection last week. The statement says workers began treating the gator and officials sought advice from other experts across the country. South Carolina Aquarium President and CEO Kevin Mills says Alabaster served as an ambassador for his species and “captivated the hearts of staff and guests alike.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Gov. Kristi Noem’s approval rating has remained steady, but her disapproval rating has crept upward in her first six months in office, according to a new poll. Noem’s 49% approval rating hasn’t changed during the first and second quarters this year. However, her disapproval rating has increased from 32% to 40%, according to Morning Consult’s quarterly governor poll. Eleven percent didn’t have an opinion of Noem’s job performance during the second quarter. Morning Consult’s poll had a 3% margin of error. The latest disapproval rating puts Noem at eighth among the top 10 most unpopular governors, according to Morning Consult.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Two Southwest Airlines planes collided on the tarmac of Nashville International Airport. Airline officials say no injuries were reported in Saturday night’s collision. An emailed statement from Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Michelle Agnew says the winglet of the St. Louis-bound Southwest Flight 1555 came into contact during pushback with the winglet of Southwest Flight 4580, headed for Atlanta. A photograph provided by a passenger on board the flight to Atlanta showed rainy weather and what appeared to be the top of the other plane’s fin clipped off. The airline says both planes returned to the gate under their own power and were taken out of service for evaluation.\n\nTexas\n\nAbilene:A park dedicated to Dyess Air Force Base personnel who died in crashes or other services to their country has been expanded to include memorial plaques. Ceremonies were held Friday at updated Dyess Memorial Park, which was a project of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Committee. The site previously featured a flagpole, a covered area and bricks. The expanded park now recognizes the 79 military personnel who gave their lives since what originally was known as Abilene Air Force Base opened in 1956. The design involves a sundial memorial, allowing the sun to enter and mark precise points on the grounds and shine on various monuments.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: Children are honing their business savvy at entrepreneur fairs in Utah after a legal change that allows children to run a business without a license or permit. The Herald Journal reports children between the ages of 5 and 16 lined the streets of downtown Logan on July 13 to sell their wares as part of The Libertas Institute’s annual Children’s Entrepreneur Market. The libertarian think-tank hosts the event in 11 cities across Utah. Market manager Lynee Fife says it helps children gain confidence, interact with adults and learn other social skills. Some items for sale included pancakes, homemade slimes and beeswax products.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is going to be receiving nearly $100,000 from the federal government so schools can get more food from local farms. The office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy says the Farm to School grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will strengthen farm-to-school programming in 20 schools in Franklin and Grand Isle counties. Anson Tebbetts, the secretary of the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, says the project will help schools, students and Vermont farmers. This award was part of more than $9 million in USDA grants for 126 projects in 42 states.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Gov. Ralph Northam says he could soon be rolling out a plan for free community college tuition. In a Wednesday announcement, the Democratic governor described a program that would allow Virginia residents to attend community colleges for free in exchange for a year spent working in public service or a high-demand field. Northam said it would be called G3 for “get skilled, get a job and give back.” He says he expects more details and a formal announcement to come in a few weeks. The Virginian-Pilot reports Northam’s proposal follows a plan he laid out while campaigning in 2017. At the time, he said the program would initially cost the state $37 million but would earn more than twice that amount back in income taxes after five years.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Puget Sound beaches were temporarily closed after millions of gallons of sewage flowed into the water. The state Department of Ecology says early Friday the West Point Wastewater Treatment Plant released an estimated 3 million gallons of untreated sewage over about 27 minutes after backup pumping systems failed during power disruptions. On Thursday, officials say a separate power failure at the Renton Wastewater Treatment Plant resulted in potentially limited disinfection of treated wastewater. That plant discharges into Puget Sound northwest of Duwamish Head in Seattle.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A West Virginia sailor and veteran is among those honored on a recently dedicated World War I memorial in New York City’s Times Square. The monument was authorized by the World War I Centennial Commission to honor six sailors who died when the USS San Diego, the largest U.S. Navy warship, sank off the coast of Long Island. The Gazette-Mail reports Frazier Oran Thomas’ hometown was listed as Charleston in Navy casualty reports. He was among more than 1,000 sailors on the ship 100 years ago and died when it exploded from coming into contact with an underwater mine. The plaque was unveiled in May during Fleet Week New York. The commission says it’s set to be permanently placed in Ocean Beach, New York, this summer.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A report shows 11 rural hospitals in Wisconsin stopped routinely delivering babies in the past 10 years. The state Office of Rural Health report shows that the closures were the result of the challenge of a low number of on-call providers and number of deliveries. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the most recent obstetrics closures were in Grantsburg and Ripon in 2017. The report, which was released last week, indicates that 56% of the state’s rural hospitals perform routine deliveries, compared with 40% of rural hospitals nationally. The report says nearly 99% of women of child-bearing age in Wisconsin live within a 30-minute drive of a hospital that provides obstetrics.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Campbell County could lose out on more than $30 million in mineral production taxes owed by a bankrupt coal company following a decision by a judge. Delaware U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Kevin Gross ruled Campbell and Converse counties don’t have first priority when it comes to collecting from Cloud Peak Energy. The Gillette News-Record reports the ruling could make it difficult for the counties to collect. They must wait in line behind other creditors. Local officials say Campbell County alone could be owed $30 million or more. Gillette-based Cloud Peak Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May. The loss will be a hit for school districts across the state. As much as 75% of the tax revenue goes back to the state for redistribution to districts statewide.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/us/five-things-march-6-trnd/index.html", "title": "Start your week smart: Ukraine, Tornado, Gas prices, Sydney ...", "text": "Do you ever get a “case of the Mondays” – that feeling of dread brought on by the thought of having to go to work after a carefree weekend?

The prosecution was led by Jennings and the state's top public corruption watchdogs and centered on allegations that McGuiness gave her child a do-little job in the office, criminally intimidated her employees and rigged payments for a state contract to avoid oversight.\n\nShe was convicted of crimes associated with hiring her daughter and the state-contract payments, but the presiding judge tossed the conviction tied to the contract payments. She was sentenced to probation and lost her reelection bid. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently considering an appeal of her remaining convictions.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday, names as defendants Chief Investigator Frank Robinson in the Department of Justice's Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust, the state's primary public corruption watchdog as well as Mark Denney, a prosecutor who until recently ran that office. Attorney General Jennings, a longtime prosecutor who has been the state's top law enforcement official since 2019, is also named as a defendant.\n\nEditor's Note: Read the complaint at the bottom of this story.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed by Dover-attorney Ron Poliquin, claims that Robinson and other officials under Jennings included false statements that they knew or had reason to believe were incorrect in a sworn search warrant affidavit that led to the confiscation of McGuiness' laptop as well as other electronics from her office before charges were filed.\n\nThese false statements violated McGuiness's constitutional rights and warrant damages that are unspecified in the complaint, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAdditionally, the litigation accuses Jennings and Denney of defamation for how they characterized the criminal charges tied to the state contract payments in a press conference in 2021 announcing the indictment against McGuiness. The complaint claims the false statements damaged McGuiness' political career.\n\nMcGuiness did not reply to a text message seeking comment.\n\n\"This is yet another sad, desperate, and wasteful attempt by the ex-Auditor to change the consequences of her actions,\" said Mat Marshall, a spokesperson for Jennings, in a written statement. \"We’ve heard this tirade before. It was rejected and she was convicted by a jury of her peers. That she continues to proclaim her innocence is not news.”\n\nIn a written statement, Denney, who recently left the Department of Justice, called the lawsuit \"frivolous.\"\n\n\"No matter how much McGuiness and her current and former attorneys want to spin and relitigate the case — and feign confusion over her structuring conviction — the jury understood it,\" Denney wrote.\n\nStructuring charge center to lawsuit:\n\nThe allegations of the lawsuit center around the criminal charge prosecutors referred to as \"structuring.\"\n\nIt was one of three foundational bad acts associated with the allegations against McGuiness. The others were hiring her daughter to work in the office, which she was convicted of, and retaliating against employees who knew about or sought to report her wrongdoing, a felony which she was acquitted of.\n\nMcGuiness has sought to minimize those charges by noting that other public officials, particularly in the Delaware General Assembly, engage in nepotism and that the people who accused her of intimidation were insincere.\n\nCompared to those bad acts, the structuring allegation carried the most overt criminal act: a statewide elected public official using the purse and power of her office to promote her own political brand and taking steps to hide that spending from state regulators.\n\nThe crime got top billing in Jennings statements to the press announcing the charges. Jennings went into the background of how consultant Christie Gross and her firm, My Campaign Group, first worked with McGuiness during McGuiness' failed 2016 campaign for Lieutenant Governor.\n\nJennings said once McGuiness assumed the role of State Auditor in 2019, she went back to Gross and \"informed her of a loophole that would allow them to avoid the competitive bidding process\" by structuring a contract with the Auditor's Office under the $50,000 threshold over which state contracts must be competitively bid.\n\nEditor's Note: The video at the top of this story is from that press conference.\n\nJennings also accused McGuiness in the press conference of structuring payments within that contract to avoid oversight by state officials in the Division of Accounting.\n\nEvolving allegation of misdeeds\n\nJennings called it a \"sweetheart deal,\" but when it comes to the actual law, the crime was something prosecutors seemed to have trouble describing in court documents.\n\nCharging papers never accused McGuiness of breaking the law by circumventing state bidding rules and instead focused on payments made pursuant to the contract with Gross, accusing McGuiness of splitting those payments up so they were less than the $5,000 threshold that triggered an additional review by state regulators.\n\nThe indictment specifically referenced payments in August and September of 2020, which prosecutors alleged were knowingly fragmented to avoid scrutiny. The indictment came down in September 2021.\n\nIn the following months, prosecutors began to share evidence with McGuiness's defense attorneys. Eventually, it became clear that prosecutors were incorrect and that the August and September payments were over $5,000 and approved by Division of Accounting regulators.\n\nProsecutors then reindicted McGuiness, changing the alleged bad act to splitting payments between funding sources and eventually took her to trial based on those charges.\n\nAt trial, prosecutors accusations eventually centered on certain forms that were not submitted alongside some of the payments. But trial testimony showed comparable paperwork problems are common, happen on a much larger scale in state government and don't result in criminal prosecution.\n\nStill, the jury found McGuiness guilty of structuring.\n\nMonths later, presiding Judge William C. Carpenter, now retired, threw out the conviction. His opinion tracked the state's changing theory on what exactly about the payments were criminal, noting there may have been paperwork infractions, but concluded that there was \"no evidence\" of intentional manipulation to avoid accounting review.\n\n“The situation here was simply a comedy of errors and not criminal conduct,\" Carpenter wrote.\n\nIncorrect search warrant argument\n\nThe basis of the constitutional violations alleged by McGuiness' lawsuit are incorrect statements about the structuring charge in an affidavit submitted by Department of Justice prosecutors to a magistrate for permission to execute a search warrant on McGuiness' office ahead of filing criminal charges.\n\nPolice must show cause to search an office, home or property generally. They do that through an affidavit that lays out what they want to search, why they want to search it and why they believe the search will produce evidence of criminal conduct. The author of those affidavits must swear that the information included is true.\n\nIn McGuiness' case, investigators applied for a search warrant to seize her laptop and other electronic devices from her office in September 2021, weeks before she was charged.\n\nIn the accompanying affidavit, Robinson, the DOJ investigator, wrote that payments to My Campaign Group had been structured to avoid scrutiny in August and September of 2020.\n\nBy then, the Division of Accounting had turned over to investigators information that showed that was not true. At trial and in hearings preceding the trial, Robinson conceded that investigators should have known better, but did not intentionally seek to deceive.\n\nThe affidavit also included what the lawsuit essentially characterizes as a lie of omission.\n\nThe search warrant sought video surveillance from McGuiness' office and, to justify that, Robinson wrote in the affidavit that an employee that was friends with whistleblowers in the case had reported that a notebook had been stolen from their desk.\n\nHowever, Robinson also knew at the time that police had investigated the reported theft, viewed records from the video system, concluded that those records did not depict theft and that the reporting employee was \"10-81,\" police code for \"crazy,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit states that absent the false statements about both the contract payments and notebook theft, there would have been no probable cause to execute the search warrants and that those lies violate McGuiness' Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nSteve Wood, McGuiness' defense attorney took the issue further.\n\nHe emphasized that he is not representing McGuiness in the civil lawsuit, but said the former auditor spent \"a hell of a lot of money defending herself on a structuring charge\" which was first based on \"false allegations\" and then based on a \"wholly bogus theory of law\" that led Carpenter, the judge, to toss the conviction.\n\n\"She was always innocent of structuring,\" Wood said.\n\nThe contested search warrant and Carpenter's handling of the fallout is also central to McGuiness' post-conviction appeals. Delaware's Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the appeal in September.\n\nDefamatory statements made by prosecutors, suit says\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses Jennings and Denney of defamation, centering on statements they made about the structuring charge at the press conference announcing the indictment.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint picks out Jennings statements about McGuiness structuring payments to avoid oversight.\n\nIt states that Jennings and Denney had information that showed that was not true and either \"intentionally or recklessly\" failed to determine the truth by the time the press conference was held.\n\nThe lawsuit adds that McGuiness's career has been harmed and she has also been forced to hire an attorney. McGuiness was defeated in the Democratic primary for the auditor's office last year.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/10/delaware-supreme-court-former-auditor-kathy-mcguiness-convictions/70194337007/", "title": "Delaware Supreme Court to decide fate of former auditor's convictions", "text": "Last year, McGuiness became the first sitting, statewide public office holder to be convicted of criminal charges.\n\nMuch of McGuiness’ appeal contests decisions Carpenter made before trial, specifically around documents that may help a defendant show they are not guilty.\n\nThe briefs will now be reviewed by the Delaware Supreme Court, which may schedule oral arguments to discuss the case or rule just using the briefs.\n\nDelaware’s former State Auditor Kathy McGuiness has asked the state’s highest court to overturn her criminal conviction, arguing state prosecutors were unfairly allowed to smear her character and snuff out her inquiries into which officials in the Delaware Department of Justice were involved in her criminal prosecution.\n\nIn appeal briefs filed earlier this week, state prosecutors argue that McGuiness is reworking arguments the trial judge already properly rejected and that the investigation into her conduct and her subsequent conviction were fair and warranted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/19/delaware-auditor-mcguiness-conviction-sentencing-corruption-politics/69571392007/", "title": "Delaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness sentenced on misconduct charges", "text": "The only statewide-elected official in Delaware history to be accused and convicted of crimes while in office was spared prison time and resigned her office on Wednesday.\n\nDelaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness was sentenced to a year of probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $10,000 fine for her misdemeanor conflict of interest and official misconduct convictions, guilty verdicts that stemmed from hiring her daughter to work in the auditor's office.\n\nThrough tears, McGuiness addressed the court during Wednesday's hearing, thanking her family and supporters, stating that she never intended to betray the public's trust and affirming that she will continue her effort to \"clear\" her name.\n\n\"I regret that my decision to hire my daughter has been seen as a violation of trust,\" McGuiness said.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence McGuiness to 30 days in prison based on her lack of remorse. McGuiness' attorney argued that a $1,000 fine was sufficient punishment.\n\nA jury found the Rehoboth Democrat guilty after a multi-week trial in July, a proceeding that also saw her acquitted of felony theft charges related to her daughter's employment as well as felony intimidation charges in which prosecutors said she spied on employee emails and sought to intimidate whistleblowers. McGuiness was also acquitted of a misdemeanor tied to payments made to a campaign and issues consultant through her office.\n\n\"We believe there is a message to be sent by virtue of the court’s sentence,\" said Mark Denney, the lead prosecutor, during Wednesday's hearing.\n\nSince her guilty verdicts, McGuiness has presented an unabashed face, claiming that hiring her daughter, who worked as a part-time employee and continued to be paid while she was enrolled in an out-of-state college, was not illegal.\n\nSteve Wood, her defense attorney, called prosecutors' request for prison time \"unjust,\" comparing it to other cases where public officials were actually caught funneling public money to themselves and were spared prison time.\n\n\"Remember: what we are here to sentence her for today is hiring her daughter as a college intern,\" Wood said.\n\nAs she unsuccessfully ran for a second term as auditor, a position that is elected statewide and is meant to be a fiscal watchdog over state and school district spending, McGuiness pointed fingers at state lawmakers whose children have been employed by the General Assembly.\n\n\"They have never been prosecuted,\" Wood said during Wednesday's hearing.\n\nProsecutors have punched back at this comparison saying they are not aware of a situation where a public official's child was both hired and allowed special privileges under their parent's supervision in state office.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wood took the judge through a litany of what he described as \"distortions\" and \"half-truths\" by prosecutors regarding the employment of McGuiness' child and how it compared to other part-time employees. Ultimately, the jury was convinced that McGuiness' child received benefits not afforded to similar employees in convicting the auditor.\n\n\"It is true that she didn't think hiring her daughter was a crime, and to be candid, she didn’t think that then and she doesn’t think that now,\" Wood said, adding that McGuiness intends to appeal her guilty verdicts to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nWood also defended McGuiness' characterization of the prosecution as political, listing a number of missteps in the prosecution of the case. Those included Department of Justice attorneys and investigators presenting incorrect information in a sworn affidavit and prosecutors failing an obligation to turn over certain evidence to the defense in a timely manner.\n\n\"This has hardly been an exemplary prosecution,\" Wood said.\n\nThe Verdict:Jury returns verdict in Delaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness criminal corruption case\n\nOne Guilty Verdict Tossed: State auditor has two criminal guilty verdicts upheld, one tossed ahead of election\n\nUltimately, presiding Judge William C. Carpenter Jr. opted for no prison time, a sentence of probation and a fine.\n\n\"Your lack of good judgment and common sense at times is reflected in the facts of this case and have led you to this day,\" Carpenter told McGuiness.\n\nMcGuiness lost her reelection bid in the September Democratic primary and her term expires at the end of the year.\n\nTrial Coverage: Why the state auditor's daughter took the stand in ongoing public corruption trial\n\nA push by Democrats in the state legislature to remove McGuiness was rebuffed largely due to a legislative roadblock created by House Speaker Peter C. Schwartzkopf, a Democrat and longtime ally of McGuiness.\n\nGov. John Carney's office has said he could not remove McGuiness from office until her sentencing. During Wednesday's hearing, Wood said that McGuiness resigned on Tuesday, effective Nov. 4. After Wednesday's sentencing hearing, she confirmed sending that resignation the day prior.\n\nLater Wednesday, a spokesperson for the governor said McGuiness sent a letter to the governor \"this afternoon\" resigning effective 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

The Democrats had publicly declared victory before 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThese results also mean that every statewide race in Delaware was won by a female Democrat, including U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. (Every other Republican candidate, besides Greg Coverdale who ran for state treasurer, was also a woman.)\n\nAt the Democratic Party watch party in downtown Wilmington, Gov. John Carney and other elected officials like Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long praised the representation of women among these races.\n\n“We call this the woman wave,” Carney said.\n\nIn an interview, Blunt Rochester said she was \"humbled, honored and pumped\" to be among the women who won their elections.\n\n\"Just being on the campaign trail and being with these women who are more than qualified, that have lived and work experience and brought integrity to the process,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"It was easy for me to lead this ticket because they were incredible.\"\n\nHere’s more of what happened in the state auditor, attorney general and treasurer races on Tuesday, and a few key things to know about each one.\n\nDelaware attorney general\n\nIn the attorney general election, Democrat incumbent Kathy Jennings will keep her seat with 53.8% of the votes compared with her Republican opponent Julianne Murray’s 46.2%.\n\nThroughout her term, Jennings has been known to take strong political stances on often contentious issues like reproductive rights. When Seaford attempted to pass an ordinance that critics claimed would limit abortion access after a Planned Parenthood clinic recently opened in the city, Jennings issued a scathing statement and sued Seaford on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n\nAs the top law enforcement officer in the state, Jennings also commented on the conviction of the former state auditor, stating that “abuse of office will not be tolerated in Delaware.”\n\nIn declaring victory late Tuesday night, Jennings returned to some of these top issues like gun reform legislation and reproductive rights. As she highlighted the successes of her previous term, the polarization of national politics shined through, too:\n\n\"Most of all, we fought, during the Trump administration and after, the 'big lie,' and we stood up for people everywhere, and we will always tell you the truth,\" Jennings said.\n\nCONVICTION:State Auditor Kathy McGuiness sentenced for public corruption convictions\n\nThis is the second time that Murray has taken on a Democrat incumbent in a statewide office after losing the governor race to Carney in 2020. The Georgetown attorney’s campaign in the last election cycle came after she sued Carney’s administration earlier that year over its short-term rental ban.\n\nVOTE BY MAIL:Delaware Supreme Court finds vote by mail, same-day registration unconstitutional\n\nIn this year’s attorney general race, Murray pointed to that lawsuit, as well as another one in which she sued to force the General Assembly to resume meeting in person in 2021. More recently, Murray won the state Supreme Court ruling that struck down vote-by-mail legislation.\n\nPresenting herself as a candidate who “backs the blue,” Murray was also endorsed by the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police and watched the results come in at the Delaware State Trooper’s Association Headquarters in Cheswold.\n\nState auditor\n\nIn the only statewide race where an incumbent wasn’t up for reelection, Democrat candidate Lydia York came out on top. Unofficial results showed York received 54.2% of the votes over her opponent Republican Janice Lorrah with 45.8% of the votes.\n\nFollowing the conviction and later sentencing of former State Auditor Kathy McGuiness, York’s platform focused on restoring the office to its “proper functioning,” and Lorrah similarly promised to bring integrity and transparency to the position.\n\nWhile visiting polling locations and volunteers, York told Delaware Online/The News Journal that her top priority will be to stabilize and enhance the office of the state auditor.\n\n\"We're going to do the work that's required of this office,\" she said. \"Not just the prior administration, but even prior, all the work wasn't getting done.\"\n\nELECTION DAY 2022:Amid busy polls, residents and candidates say every vote counts\n\nThat means providing people with the information they need, York said. For example, she said she met with tenants of a high-rise building who knew that millions of dollars were allocated to improvements in their building, but they didn't know where that money went.\n\n\"You should be able to see $9.5 million of improvements or maintenance, even for that matter,\" York said. \"So that's how this office can help the people. And I think that's what's been missing for a while.\"\n\nLorrah took a different approach than her opponent by touting her ability to challenge the government, pointing to a moment earlier this year when she filed and won a lawsuit against the governor for extending mask mandates in public and private schools.\n\nUltimately, York – who was backed by the Democratic Party even in the primaries – will likely become the state’s next auditor.\n\nWhen introducing York at the Democratic Party watch party in Wilmington, Carney thanked York for stepping forward and running for office.\n\nState treasurer\n\nIncumbent Colleen Davis secured her seat with 53.6% of the votes, according to unofficial election results; her opponent Greg Coverdale was behind her with 46.4%.\n\nDavis' campaign leaned on her experience as treasurer, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when her office was charged with overseeing the distribution of federal funding. Some of the issues that Davis has focused on include strengthening state workers' retirement plans and supporting Delaware's students by expanding college savings accounts.\n\nSTATE RETIREMENT PLAN:Delaware officials change course, revert to old health plan for state retirees\n\nCoverdale worked to appeal to voters on both sides of the political spectrum through his professional experience in finance, having worked with major companies like Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade and Merrill Lynch.\n\nIn campaign conversations about the fiscal health of Delaware, Coverdale talked about ensuring that Medicare is adequately funded so Delawareans can get the health care they need.\n\nStaff reporter Meredith Newman contributed to this reporting.\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches, with a focus on health-related issues.

The Department of Labor ruled in May 2018 that Wagner did not have sufficient cause to fire Davies, though it noted it could not review the full Grant Thornton report because Wagner did not provide it.\n\nEight Auditor of Accounts employees interviewed by Grant Thornton described a “hostile workplace” environment in which they felt pressured to deviate from generally accepted auditing practices, the report said.\n\nRuling: Auditor didn't have sufficient cause to dismiss Kathleen Davies\n\n“Several of the employees, as well as the state auditor, also said that (Davies’) extreme and disparaging behavior was a direct factor in multiple former employees leaving the office for employment elsewhere,” the report said. “It was clear to us that (Auditor of Accounts) employees feared that speaking out against (Davies) would cause retribution and worsen already tense office conditions.”\n\nEmployee allegations\n\nThe Auditor’s Office had not had any dealings with Grant Thornton before 2017 and in the last two years paid it $120,527, according to Delaware’s Open Checkbook.\n\nThe report said Davies, who oversaw auditing staff and other non-elected Auditor of Accounts positions, appeared to have:\n\nAbused authority temporarily delegated to her by Wagner­\n\nRefused to follow state travel expense requirements and purchase card policies\n\nDisclosed confidential information to a legislator\n\nDeliberately withheld information, and directed employees to withhold information, from the state auditor\n\nInfluenced contract awards to parties with whom she had personal relationships\n\nThreatened staff by incorrectly telling them that no whistleblower protections existed for state employees\n\nCreated a hostile office environment and a culture of fear and intimidation\n\nIntercepted Wagner’s email and postal mail\n\nEach of the allegations is addressed and investigated separately in the report.\n\nA source said it took several months to negotiate a contract with Grant Thornton and decide how the investigation would be split up between the contractor and Delaware’s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nGrant Thornton was eventually retained to conduct the entire investigation after Davies’ attorney said the budget office was being audited by Davies, which could create a conflict.\n\n‘Abuse of power’\n\nAccording to the report, Wagner told Grant Thornton he has historically relied on the chief administrative auditor to maintain the day-to-day operations of the state Auditor’s Office.\n\n“He informed us that, for this reason, he had allowed (Davies) to take on certain functions or operate with limited oversight,” the report said, which led to her “abuse of power.”\n\nBy the time Davies was put on leave, Wagner had come to believe Davies was abusing his trust, the report said.\n\nIn March 2011, Wagner signed a temporary delegation of authority order that granted Davies the power to act on the state auditor’s behalf in the event of his “temporary disability or absence from the office,” the report said.\n\nAt the time, Wagner had undergone several minor medical procedures causing him to miss work time, the report said.\n\nA deputy attorney general reviewed the order and suggested revisions so Davies would only be able to exercise the authority in specific instances, according to the report.\n\nBut Davies frequently made administrative decisions, even when Wagner was in the office, the report said. She signed several documents that should have been signed by Wagner, the report said, and removed Wagner as the signatory on certain contracts and authorization forms.\n\nAfter Davies was put on leave, Wagner recovered several stamps with his signature on them from Davies’ office, the report said.\n\nDavies’ understanding of the delegation of authority differed, she told The News Journal.\n\n“In January of 2011, the Deputy position became vacant and was never filled throughout my tenure,” she said. “Mr. Wagner himself testified under oath at the (unemployment insurance) hearing ‘I did not care what title you used.’ He formally delegated authority to me through signed documents and consistent and undisputed past practices.”\n\nThe Department of Labor’s unemployment division said in its final ruling that “no evidence was provided by (Wagner) that the Auditor’s Delegation of Authority was limited in scope or time or had been revoked.”\n\nIn April 2013, Davies stopped listing the state auditor as her supervisor on forms and began approving her own forms, the Grant Thornton report said.\n\n“(Davies) informed us that authority to sign contracts was granted to her by the state auditor and that she would ‘keep things moving’ around the office unless the state auditor expressed issues or concerns,” the report said. “She also informed us that she kept the state auditor apprised of documents she signed on behalf of him and the (office).”\n\nThe state’s Division of Accounting questioned why Davies was signing documents, according to the Grant Thornton report. They emailed Wagner to ask if she had the authority to do so, but it was unclear whether he ever responded or even saw the message, the report said.\n\nEarlier that year, Davies had pressured an employee to give her complete access to both Wagner’s email account and his Outlook calendar, the report said.\n\nAfter Davies gained access, Wagner’s assistant noticed several appointments disappear from the auditor’s calendar, the report said.\n\nDavies also instituted a new office policy requiring that all of Wagner’s mail be delivered to her first, the report said.\n\nShe opened the mail and logged it, before passing it on to Wagner. Wagner told Grant Thornton’s investigators that he thought it was odd that he was no longer getting invitations to certain state events, such as the annual Governor’s Prayer Breakfast, but didn’t inquire further about them, the report said.\n\nDavies told The News Journal the policy regarding Wagner’s mail was “based upon the fact the office would receive extremely time-sensitive information and communications regarding licensing issues and lawsuits.”\n\nShe said Wagner received all his mail after it was logged.\n\n“Further, during the (unemployment hearing) Mr. Wagner testified that he forwarded emails and calls directly to me for handling,” Davies said.\n\nThe Department of Labor’s unemployment benefits division also investigated allegations that Davies had inappropriately accessed Wagner’s email.\n\n“The auditor testified that he forwarded all his calls to (Davies) and gave her access to his email account,” the Department of Labor ruling said. “The auditor’s testimony that he believed he was only giving (Davies) ‘read’ access to his email strains credibility in view of the Delegation of Authority to act in his absence.”\n\n“It is undisputed that the auditor was frequently absent from the office.”\n\nCircumventing state rules\n\nWagner said that at some point Davies started approving her own travel expenses and stopped submitting forms to him, the report said. It is unclear why Wagner didn’t question the change.\n\nDavies failed to submit receipts for various expenses, and instead of using a state-issued credit card, improperly claimed a per diem, the report said.\n\nState policy urges employees to use government-issued credit cards for those kinds of costs whenever possible. Software allows state department and division heads to easily track spending made on the cards, and they can get alerts about spikes or odd patterns.\n\nInstead of routinely doing that, the report said, Davies frequently sought reimbursements for her out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAuditor’s office employees said Davies told them not to comply with state travel guidelines, either, and to use their personal credit cards while on business trips, the report said.\n\nWagner said the issue involving credit cards was brought to his attention, but he could not remember why he didn’t act on it, the report said.\n\nDavies told The News Journal that she followed the state’s guidelines.\n\n“All reimbursements processed over my tenure at (Auditor of Accounts) went through various approvals and sign-offs,” she said. “This included approvals required in the state accounting system. No one person at (Auditor of Accounts) can process an expenditure on their own, including travel. Further, I did not calculate or prepare my reimbursements, that was prepared by administrative/accounting staff.”\n\nIn a separate incident, employees said Davies asked them to circumvent state rules regarding purchase orders by telling them to transfer $10,000 in travel funds in increments of less than $5,000, the report said. Purchase orders are required for purchases over $5,000, individually or in aggregate.\n\nBreach of confidentiality\n\nEmployees said Davies did not follow office policy when she performed audits, the report said.\n\nIn 2016, Davies sent a draft report of a unit count audit to state Rep. Kim Williams, D-Newport, the report said. The annual audit examines whether schools are reporting accurate enrollment numbers, which affects how much state funding they receive.\n\nFollowing a rash of scandals where several charter school leaders were found to be using taxpayer money for personal purchases, Davies made appearances in the Legislature to testify in support of one of Williams’ bills. It would have given the state auditor authority to select the firms that audit charter schools, which unlike traditional schools, work out their own contracts.\n\nAudit: School leaders misused charter funds\n\nWhile the Department of Labor’s unemployment benefits division determined she had the authority to send Williams the audit, the Grant Thornton report disagreed.\n\n“The policy does not state that it is acceptable for the (chief administrative auditor) to release confidential client information, which was transmitted in the form of a draft report,” the report said. “Davies breached those provisions in providing the Unit Count Performance Audit draft report to Ms. Williams.”\n\nWilliams, the legislator, might have received other information from Davies, the report said.\n\nGrant Thornton believes Davies also sent her a draft report regarding petty cash usage at charter schools, the report said. Later, Williams requested the report in a Freedom of Information Act Request, using its exact, working title, which she would not have known unless someone in the Auditor’s Office supplied her with it, the Grant Thornton report said.\n\nDavies told Grant Thornton investigators during an interview that she had authorized the report’s release.\n\nThe report itself was never publicly released. Only eight people had access to it. Staff, in consultation with the state auditor, instead provided letters informing schools of proper policies and procedures, the report said.\n\nDavies denied any wrongdoing in her communications with Williams.\n\n“My actions were within my responsibilities, duties, consistent with past practices throughout my tenure, and in accordance with professional audit and investigations standards,” she told The News Journal. “Under Government Auditing Standards and (Auditor of Accounts) Policies and Procedures draft reports are not considered ‘confidential.’”\n\nAuditor: Delaware oversight of federal aid program weak\n\nWithholding information\n\nThe report said Davies selectively withheld information from Wagner regarding audits, security upgrades and office finances.\n\nIn one example, Davies had silent alarms and cameras installed without Wagner’s knowledge and approval, the report said. “He (Wagner) noted the only other office he is aware of that has silent alarms is the governor, and moreover, that the alarm trigger button was not even in his office, but rather in (Davies’) office.”\n\nDavies purchased law-enforcement style badges for the office for $1,705, but verbally directed staff not to order one for Wagner or let him know she bought them, the report said.\n\nIn another example, Davies instructed staff not to tell him about a $90,000 balance in the office’s training fund because “he’ll want to spend it on a junket,” the report said.\n\n“The state auditor stated that he is a strong proponent of training, and would have liked to use that money to help send his staff to educational and networking events,” the report said. “He intends to start using the funds in the account to do so.”\n\nIn an audio recording from May 12, 2016, Davies instructed staff not to provide updates to the state auditor on an open investigation, the report said.\n\n“(Davies) stated, ‘Even when Tom comes up to you, the proper way to deal with that is to keep it light and generic. I’m not telling you to be rude to him or anything, but you could inadvertently tell him something and he doesn’t realize that it can’t be out for public … it will negatively impact the investigation and something he doesn’t always realize … that it is not public information,” the report said.\n\n“We are not aware for any reason for the acting state auditor, present or future, to not have insight into the operation, projects or files of his/her own office,” the report continued. “Furthermore, the state auditor has been in the office for over two decades and is familiar with audit practices and necessary confidentiality standards.”\n\nDavies told The News Journal she did not withhold any information from Wagner or direct other employees to do so.\n\n“In fact, Mr. Wagner admitted during the (unemployment) hearing that ‘we would have discussions all the time,’” she said. “The auditor was routinely kept apprised of information and I answered any questions he needed to know.”\n\nObjectivity in contracting\n\nGrant Thornton investigated whether Davies awarded contracts to close acquaintances and friends.\n\nIn one instance, the office was deciding between two contractors, Santora CPA Group and Zelenkofske Axelrod LLC, the report said. A committee originally selected Santora, using a point system, but after Davies talked negatively about the company, staff felt pressured to change their scores, the report said.\n\nLater, Zelenkofske Axelrod was also chosen to conduct a peer review over the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers. Wagner said Davies had personal conflicts with several members of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, including its executive director and review committee chairman, the report said.\n\nDavies told The News Journal that the auditor’s office continued to contract with the firm after she was put on leave. The most recent contract listed on Delaware’s General Support Services site was awarded in June 2017 to audit the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control’s hazardous substance cleanup fund.\n\nAnother contract was awarded to Crystal Feliciano, who attended Davies’ wedding and worked with her in the New Jersey Comptroller’s Office, according to the Grant Thornton report. She was to train local volunteer fire departments how to use QuickBooks, on behalf of the auditor’s office.\n\nEmployees discovered Feliciano had recently been fired from that New Jersey position for misusing state time and resources while volunteering for a local political campaign, according to the report.\n\nThe contract was eventually canceled, but not until after the Auditor’s Office spent $10,908 buying laptops for the training Feliciano was hired to perform, the report said. Those computers are in the process of being sold to another state agency at a loss.\n\nDavies told The News Journal that other Auditor of Accounts staff recommended hiring Feliciano for the QuickBooks training, and the office had also contracted with her for training in 2011 or 2012.\n\n“Her second contract was canceled by me after considerable time had passed with no progress on the project,” Davies said. “She did not receive any payment for services.”\n\nWhistleblower protections\n\nEmployees said Davies told them on multiple occasions that they were not eligible for whistleblower protection, according to the report.\n\nIn one audio recording that Grant Thornton reviewed, Davies said “If you want to whistle blow, you’re on your own or you go to the whistleblowing unit at the AG’s office, and there’s very select cases that they take for that…we have proven that there is no protection for anybody that even wants to say that something is illegal or inappropriately done in this state.”\n\nIn Delaware, employees cannot be fired for reporting violations of financial management and accounting standards laws. Employers are required under the Whistleblowers’ Protection Act to inform employees that they will not be retaliated against for whistleblowing.\n\nDavies told The News Journal she talked to staff about whistleblower protections after a deputy attorney general informed the office that employees would have to provide their own defense at their own expense if involved in such a case.\n\n“In (Auditor of Account)’s spring 2016 public training session, attended by staff, we had a deputy attorney general out to train staff on Delaware tremble (sic) damages and whistleblower act,” Davies said.\n\nTreble damages refer to financial compensation awarded by a court to a prevailing plaintiff that are three times the actual or compensatory damages.\n\nA hostile workplace\n\nEmployees said Davies created a hostile work environment and openly berated staff, the report said.\n\nVarious staff members were instructed not to speak to Wagner, or to certain other members of the staff, the report said. Wagner noticed that people stopped talking to him, but thought they were mad at him, the report said.\n\nIn May 2016, Davies accused Wagner of sexually harassing an employee, the report said. Davies said Wagner had touched a young, female staff member during a whistleblower training session, the report said.\n\nAn audit manager was instructed by Davies to talk to the young female staff member and document the incident, but the staff member had no complaint, the report said.\n\nThe young woman said Wagner had touched her shoulders, but not in a bothersome or offensive nature, she confirmed in an email later that month, according to the report.\n\nDavies told The News Journal none of the staff filed grievances against her during her tenure in the office.\n\n“I have been supportive and provided professional and educational opportunities for employees,” she said. “I personally paid for holiday events and various functions to support the morale of the staff. I worked to obtain promotions and a series of pay increases for the professional staff.\n\n“I did require that staff work on behalf of the taxpayers when on the clock including political appointees who consistently insisted on doing campaign endeavors during work hours. There were, and still are staff that are good workers and are committed to doing the right things. This has been and continues to be my point during my campaign.”\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Tom Carper extended his 42-year win streak Thursday by soundly defeating political newcomer Kerri Evelyn Harris in what many expected would be the most contested primaries of his career.\n\nHis 65-35 percent victory represents a triumph for both the Democratic Party establishment and the vaunted \"Delaware Way\" that the 71-year-old has long spearheaded.\n\nAfter Harris called to concede about 9:45 p.m., Carper entered a room full of supporters at Frawley Stadium in Wilmington with a broad smile and a cheer of \"Play ball!\"\n\nHe began his victory speech by acknowledging Harris and the energy she brought to the race.\n\n\"All the young people who got energized,\" he said. \"The people who got involved ... congratulations to you.\"\n\nHe emphasized that Democrats must now come together and prepare for the general election.\n\n\"We need to unite as a party,\" he said. \"We share the same values.\"\n\nCarper’s return to Congress is still not assured. He first must face Sussex County Councilman Rob Arlett, who defeated former PayPal executive Gene Truono by 67-28 percent on Thursday to become the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate. California businessman Rocky De La Fuenta received 5 percent of the vote.\n\nDue to Democrats’ overwhelming voter-registration advantage in Delaware, that Nov. 6 general election contest could prove to be an easier contest than Carper's win over Harris.\n\nThe primary was a major test for Carper, a centrist who previously served multiple terms as Delaware’s governor and lone U.S. Congressman.\n\nDespite her lack of political experience, Harris’s campaign drew national attention for its potential to continue the progressive insurgency that has helped candidates of color topple entrenched Democrats around the country.\n\nThat did not happen in Delaware, where progressives have gained ground in legislative races but have yet to find success in landing statewide offices.\n\n\"It's still very hard to unseat an incumbent, despite what you might think from all the attention paid to the few instances where it's occurred recently,\" said David Redlawsk, chair of the University of Delaware's political science and international relations department.\n\n\"Two of the notable Congressional districts where upsets did happen occurred in more urban districts,\" he said. \"A statewide election, even in a small state, is a different thing, especially in Delaware, which has a history of middle-of-the-road politics.\"\n\nDespite the loss, Harris appeared energized even as she delivered a concession speech to her supporters at Washington Street Ale House in Wilmington in which she promised to back Carper in the general election.\n\n\"They know we have awoken,\" she said of the Democratic establishment. \"They have to start working for us ... We need change and we need it now.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old Dover community activist and Air Force veteran, had campaigned on Bernie Sanders-style promises of a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, Medicare for all, eliminating all student loan debt and abolishing the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nShe also rejected personal attacks against Carper in favor of challenging the three-term incumbent’s voting record and financial backing from banking and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nHer platform won the backing of groups outside Delaware, such as the partisan website The Intercept and the Working Families Party, a New York-based coalition of unions and activists that reportedly spent close to $100,000 for a slew of online ads, mailers, door knockers and robo-texts on her behalf.\n\nBut Carper secured support from the traditional pillars of Democrat power in Delaware, including the AFL-CIO and the Delaware State Education Association – unions that historically have delivered votes on election day.\n\nThe Delaware Democratic Party also backed Carper, in a rare primary endorsement that helped to stave off the identity crisis that Harris’s campaign posed.\n\n\"The future of our party – and indeed the state has always been in the hands of voters,\" party chairman Erik Raser-Schramm said in a release. \"The Democratic ticket they delivered is a formidable one that from top-to-bottom has the best interest of Delawareans at heart.\"\n\nThe First State has long prided itself on taking a bipartisan approach to politics that has long produced state leaders with an economically conservative but socially liberal bent.\n\nMany of the state’s highest-ranking leaders earned their stripes under Carper’s tutelage, including current Gov. John Carney, U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester and Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo Strine.\n\nCarper also has wielded considerable local influence within the party by helping to fill the coffers of down-ballot Democratic candidates for decades.\n\nWhen it came time to tout the backing they received from national party leaders, Harris held two events with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, a progressive darling who defeated a 10-term Congressman in June.\n\nCarper, meanwhile, pushed robo-calls and radio ads featuring former vice president Joe Biden, arguably the most popular political figure in Delaware history.\n\n\"I've seen some reports that Carper spent close to $3 million on this race,\" Redlawsk said. \"That kind of money has a big influence on getting your word out to voters.\"\n\nThe fact Harris was unable to overcome those obstacles is not nearly as surprising as how close she came.\n\nJust four years removed from making fried chicken at Royal Farms, her message and presence on the campaign trail impressed many party insiders.\n\nIt also forced Carper to the left, as evidenced by his recent support for a $15 minimum wage and is adamant opposition to U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a judge he previously helped confirm to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, who backed Carper, said he was impressed by Harris.\n\n\"Kerri Harris is a star,\" he said. \"I hope she continues to fight.\"\n\nRedlawsk said many other Democrats were impressed as well.\n\n\"She did quite an astoundingly good job for having relatively no money and no experience going into this,\" he said. \"It will be interesting to see if we hear more from her in the future.\"\n\nElection Must-Reads\n\nMcGuiness wins close 3-way Democratic primary for auditor\n\nKathy Jennings wins Democratic nod for Delaware attorney general\n\nWalker takes U.S. House race, will face Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nLiveblog: Live analysis of election results\n\nFor full Primary coverage and statewide election results, go to DelawareOnline.com\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/24/till-statue-lin-manuel-miranda-buried-convertible-news-around-states/50868009/", "title": "Till statue, Lin-Manuel Miranda: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRussellville: A northern Alabama community with large numbers of Hispanic immigrants is using federal COVID-19 relief money to fund an experiment to better serve students who are still learning English. They are hiring and certifying more local, Spanish-speaking staff. More than half of 2,500 students in the small Russellville city school district identify as Hispanic or Latino, and about a quarter are learning English. But the district at times has struggled to find the people and money necessary to help those students achieve. As part of a recent exercise to help the class learn English, a third grader pulled a block from a Jenga tower and read aloud a question written on one side. “Where,” the boy read, then slowly sounded out the other words: “Where would you like to visit?” “Disneyland,” one student said. “Space,” another chimed in. “Guatemala,” one girl said. Kathy Alfaro, a new English language teacher at Russellville Elementary, exchanged a few words with the girl in Spanish, then turned to the other students. “Do y’all know what she said?” Alfaro asked the class. “She said she has a lot of family in Guatemala because she was born there. And I told her that I was born here, but I also have a lot of family in Guatemala.” Districtwide, the percentage of students who met their language proficiency goals increased from 46% in 2019 to 61% in 2022. At the two elementary schools, proficiency jumped by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, received a hero’s welcome Thursday when the Democrat gave the keynote address at the Alaska Federation of Natives conference in Anchorage. Those attending the largest annual gathering of Natives in Alaska showered her with standing ovations, spontaneous songs and gifts, including a bolo tie worn by her Republican predecessor, the late Don Young. Young’s daughter Joni Nelson presented the tie to Peltola, saying it was a passing of the mantle to her. The surprise presentation came after Young’s adult children joined Peltola on stage as she paid tribute to Young, who held Alaska’s sole seat in the House for 49 years until his death in March. Peltola defeated Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich in an August special election to finish out Young’s term. Those three, along with Libertarian Chris Bye, are competing for a full two-year term in the November election. Another of Young’s daughters, Dawn Vallely, later said on stage that her father would have been happy with the results of the special election, won by Peltola. Nelson wore the white beaded tie – which features the state of Alaska in blue beads – onstage but removed it to place it around Peltola’s neck when she greeted the family.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sued the federal government to be able to keep more than 100 double-stacked shipping containers that Republican Gov. Doug Ducey had placed to fill in gaps along the U.S.-Mexico border near the southwestern desert community of Yuma. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Arizona on Friday asks that the state be allowed to take the unilateral action it believes necessary to defend its residents from migrants illegally crossing the border. Ducey complains the U.S. government is not doing enough to stop migrants from coming to Arizona, forcing the state to take action. The shipping containers went up in August. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation last week sent a letter telling Arizona to take down the containers, saying they are unauthorized and violate U.S. law. Arizona refused. The Cocopah Indian Tribe in southwestern Arizona also complained that some of the containers were placed on its reservation without permission. The Bureau of Reclamation also demanded that no new containers be placed, saying it hoped to prevent conflicts with federal construction contracts to fill the gaps in the wall near the Morelos Dam in the Yuma area.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended her avoidance of local media in her bid for governor Friday as she appeared in her only debate ahead of next month’s election. Sanders, the Republican nominee who is heavily favored in the November election, has conducted few local interviews during her bid for the state’s top office. Sanders had agreed to only one debate with Democratic nominee Chris Jones and Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington. Sanders said she’s been speaking directly to voters by campaigning around the state. “Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press comes a great deal of responsibility,” Sanders said. “When they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside the box, which I have done every single day for the past two years.” Public polling has shown Sanders leading by double digits, and she’s shattered fundraising records in the predominantly Republican state. Early voting begins Monday in Arkansas. During her two year term as ex-President Donald Trump’s chief spokeswoman, Sanders scaled back televised news briefings after repeatedly sparring with reporters who aggressively questioned her. Sanders often sought to justify the lack of formal briefings by saying they were unnecessary when journalists could hear from Trump directly.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAtherton: Three decades after a car was reported stolen in Northern California, police are digging the missing convertible out of the yard of a $15 million mansion built by a man with a history of arrests for murder, attempted murder and insurance fraud. The convertible Mercedes Benz, filled with bags of unused concrete, was discovered Thursday by landscapers in the affluent town of Atherton in Silicon Valley, Mayor Rick DeGolia said, reading a statement from police. Although cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains Thursday, none had been found more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car, DeGolia said. Police believe the car was buried 4 to 5 feet deep in the backyard of the home sometime in the 1990s – before the current owners bought the home. The car was reported stolen in September 1992 in nearby Palo Alto, he said. By Friday, the technicians had been able to excavate the passenger side of the convertible, which was buried with its top down. They also opened the trunk, where they found more bags of unused cement. Cadaver dogs were again brought back to the house and again “made a slight notification of possible human remains,” DeGolia said.\n\nColorado\n\nCastle Rock: Brewing beer, cooking food, and refilling water bottles with recycled wastewater could soon become standard practice in a state that’s synonymous with its pristine-tasting snowmelt and mountain springs. Last week, Colorado’s water quality agency gave unanimous preliminary approval to regulate direct potable reuse – the process of treating sewage and sending it directly to taps without first being dispersed in a larger water body. Pending a final vote in November, the state would become the first to adopt direct potable reuse regulations, according to state and federal officials. “Having well-developed regulations … helps ensure projects are safe and that project proponents know what will be required of them,” said Laura Belanger, water resources engineer with the non-profit Western Resource Advocates. As the state’s population explodes, and regional water supplies dwindle, recycling water for drinking is a significant opportunity for stretching a limited supply, said Kevin Reidy, conservation specialist for the Colorado Water Conservation Board. And he said it’s a game changer in a place like Castle Rock, a city of 75,000 just south of Denver nestled under its prominent namesake butte, that relies primarily on pumping finite groundwater for drinking.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hartford: The grieving widows of two slain police officers gave tearful tributes to their husbands Friday during a funeral attended by thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country. Others who spoke at the service for Bristol Officers Dustin DeMonte and Alex Hamzy pleaded for an end to hatred and suspicion against the police. “To Alex and Dustin, you were both true heroes, amazing people, and you will be missed beyond words by everyone,” said DeMonte’s wife, Laura, who is pregnant with their third child. “I am so sorry this happened to you. Two of the very best humans. So kind, positive and fun-loving.” DeMonte, Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato were shot Oct. 12 in what police believe was an ambush set up by a 911 call made by the shooter, Nicholas Brutcher. Iurato, who survived a gunshot wound to his leg, struggled to get behind a police cruiser and fired a single shot that killed Brutcher. Brutcher’s brother, Nathan, also was shot – possibly by his brother – and survived. DeMonte was a sergeant with 10 years’ experience on the force, and Hamzy was an officer for eight years. The funeral included formal, posthumous promotions of DeMonte to lieutenant and Hamzy to sergeant.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor was sentenced Wednesday to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service for official misconduct and conflict of interest convictions. Auditor Kathy McGuiness avoided jail time for the misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, news outlets report. McGuiness maintains her innocence, and prosecutors sought a sentence of 30 days in prison for the Rehoboth Beach Democrat based on her lack of remorse. Her attorney argued that a $1,000 fine was sufficient. In July, a Kent County jury convicted McGuiness on three misdemeanor counts but acquitted her on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. A judge later threw out a misdemeanor conviction for improperly structuring contract payments to a consulting firm, rejecting her request for a new trial. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of her daughter Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness. Prosecutors alleged that Saylar McGuiness, 20, and a friend were hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden will host a roundtable Monday on breast and cervical cancer, part of the administration’s “moonshot” effort to reduce deaths from cancer, the White House said. The event is one of many being launched by the American Cancer Society. Singer Mary J. Blige, an advocate for cancer screening, will participate in the roundtable with Biden. President Joe Biden announced in February his goal of halving cancer deaths in the next 25 years. The issue is personal for the president, whose son Beau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer. Biden launched the cancer moonshot the following year when serving as then-President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than 230 pythons were removed from the Everglades as part of an annual competition to eliminate the invasive species from the South Florida wetlands preserve. Florida wildlife officials said Thursday that 1,000 hunters from 32 states and as far away as Canada and Latvia removed 231 Burmese pythons during the 10-day competition known as the Florida Python Challenge. Matthew Concepcion won the $10,000 top prize for removing 28 Burmese pythons. Another hunter, Dustin Crum, won a $1,500 prize for removing the longest python, a snake that measured over 11 feet long. Pythons became invasive in Florida after they were brought into the state as pets and then abandoned in the wild by their owners, wildlife officials say. Since 2000, more than 17,000 wild Burmese pythons have been removed from Florida, where they are a destructive presence for native species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Every one of the pythons removed as part of the Challenge is one less preying on our native birds, mammals and reptiles,” said Rodney Barreto, the commission’s chairman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters. Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection in the midterm elections Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock’s behalf: composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Who I’m really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda because I’m a really big fan of his,” said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock. Georgia Democrats spent the first week of the state’s 19-day early voting period in frantic activity, as they implore supporters to vote in advance. Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams each held multiple events a day. Miranda also appeared with Abrams at a restaurant in suburban Lawrenceville on Wednesday, while the Abrams campaign later rolled out a recorded chat with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday night. Almost 575,000 people had voted in Georgia by the end of Thursday, roughly on pace with the 2020 presidential election, when 5 million votes were cast in the state, buoying Democratic hopes that a big turnout might help them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines will operate 10 cargo planes for Amazon.com starting next fall under a deal that could eventually involve more planes and give Amazon a 15% stake in the airline. The airline’s parent company, Hawaiian Holdings Inc., said Friday that it will fly and maintain an “initial fleet” of 10 leased Airbus A330-300 jets for the retail giant. The fleet could grow “depending on Amazon’s future business needs,” the company said. Hawaiian said it issued warrants that Amazon can exercise over the next nine years and acquire up to 15% of Hawaiian stock. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings jumped 13% in afternoon trading Friday. When travel plunged and consumer spending spiked early in the pandemic, airlines began carrying more cargo and demand for freighter planes grew. More recently, the cargo business has cooled off as consumer spending shifted away from goods toward services including travel, and airlines have been stuck with excess cargo capacity. Global demand for cargo fell 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association reported this month. Hawaiian said it won’t use any of its current planes to serve Amazon. Instead, Amazon’s air division will lease the first 10 planes -- which will be converted from passenger jets to freighters -- from leasing company Altavair.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not uncommon for Idaho wildlife officials to be called for help when a moose, mountain lion, black bear or other wild animals wander into one of the state’s rural communities. But Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking the public for help with a particularly unusual find – a 3.5-foot alligator that was discovered hiding in the brush of a rural neighborhood about 40 miles northwest of Boise. Southwest Region spokesperson Brian Pearson told the Idaho Statesman that a New Plymouth resident was walking their dog Thursday evening when they noticed something moving in the brush. Further investigation revealed the alligator – a creature commonly found in the coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S., but certainly not native to Idaho. Pearson said the resident put the alligator in a nearby horse trailer until Idaho Fish and Game conservation officer could pick it up Friday morning. The department has the animal in captivity for now, but Pearson said it will be euthanized or given to a licensed facility unless the owner is located. Idaho Fish and Game officials are hoping members of the public will call the department if they have any information about the alligator’s origins.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three young men were fatally shot and two more seriously wounded early Sunday during what police called a caravan of street racers involving about 100 vehicles that took over an intersection on the city’s Southwest Side. The shooting happened about 4 a.m. in Brighton Park after the caravan blocked streets leading to the intersection for illegal street racing, Chicago police Cmdr. Don Jerome said during a news conference. Those killed were between the ages of 15 and 20, Jerome said, adding that the two wounded are expected to survive. Police made no immediate arrests. Caravans blocking streets for drag racing, cars turning doughnuts and “drifting” are a “semi-recent phenomenon where they gather throughout different points of the city, and there were several others last night of no consequence … until this one,” Jerome said. The City Council member for the neighborhood where Sunday’s shooting happened said police and other city officials needed to act more aggressively to shut down such caravans. “This is not just fun and games on the street,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told reporters at the scene. “We are seeing gangs and criminality join into the drifting and drag racing.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A northwestern Indiana man who pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his 9-year-old daughter as he was talking to her two brothers about gun safety won’t serve any prison time for her 2017 death. A Lake County judge sentenced Eric S. Hummel, 38, on Thursday to one year to be served in the county’s community corrections program while living at home, followed by 31/ 2 years of probation. Judge Natalie Bokota accepted the Hobart man’s guilty plea to reckless homicide and neglect of a dependent charges in Olivia Hummel’s death, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Prosecutors had sought an 81/ 2 -year prison sentence for Hummel, but Bokota said she agreed with Hummel’s attorneys that incarcerating him would result in further trauma to his boys. According to court records, Hummel said he was showing a handgun to his sons and telling them to never play with it “because it can kill someone” when he accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Hummel told a 911 dispatcher he didn’t realize the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. He admitted in his plea agreement that he was talking to his sons about gun safety in a bedroom of his Hobart home in June 2017 when he pointed a handgun at the boys and pulled the trigger.\n\nIowa\n\nGrinnell: In a rare move, leaders of Grinnell College and the city appealed this month for the public’s help to put an end to racial harassment, slurs and graffiti that have shaken the campus community this fall. In an open letter to the public Oct. 16, Grinnell Mayor Dan F. Agnew and Grinnell College President Anne F. Harris asked residents to mobilize against the harassment against black citizens, students and community members and not be complacent to any racism they may witness. They urged residents to report any harassment or vandalism to police, tip police if they know any individuals who have been involved, and to enroll in bystander intervention training to help prevent future incidents. Grinnell police said Friday that they had only one formal incident report, and no arrests had been made. But in a statement to the campus community Oct. 12, the private college said there had been several incidents, including defacement of campus signs and vehicles with racist and white supremacist graffiti and harassment of community members by “unknown individuals screaming slurs from moving vehicles.” “We also know that additional incidents may not have been reported,” the statement said. Grinnell, routinely ranked as one of the nation’s best liberal arts colleges, has a diverse student body.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two years after her mate’s death, a female lion at the Topeka Zoo has grown a mane. The confident, sassy African lion named Zuri was always pretty much in charge of her three-member pride at the zoo, said her animal curator, Shanna Simpson. But staff members were still taken aback when, in the wake of her mate’s death two years ago, the aging lioness began growing what appeared to be a “mohawk” atop her head. That was followed by a rare and significant growth of the fur around Zuri’s head and neck, Simpson said. Zuri is intelligent, feisty and easy to train, Simpson said. The Topeka Zoo acquired Zuri and sister Asante in 2005 from the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, then in 2006 it acquired Avus from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisconsin, to mate with Zuri and Asante. Avus had a large mane. Female African lions are attracted to males with large manes, Simpson said. Those manes help protect the males as they fight with other lions and with predators such as leopards and hyenas, she said. Zoo staff suspect Zuri’s increase in fur was triggered by the death of Avus, which left she and her sister as the only remaining members of their pride, Simpson said. “She feels like she needs to protect her pride, so her testosterone increases,” Simpson said. “And boom, she’s got more fur around her neck.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Local public transit workers have authorized a strike, but they aren’t walking out just yet. Union members with the Transit Authority of River City voted 95% in favor of the strike authorization Thursday, amid contentious contract negotiations. For now, buses will continue to run as scheduled, with no immediate plans to initiate a strike, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1447 President Lillian Brents said after the vote. The two sides are set to return to the bargaining table Nov. 2. Union leadership said workers want “a safe workplace and a fair contract.” The union is asking for a 6% raise for all workers after one year and 4% raises after years two and three, along with a cost-of-living adjustment of 1.25% every six months. TARC has offered a 3% raise for technical maintenance workers and radio room employees, a 2.5% raise for coach operators and a 1% raise for nontechnical maintenance workers, according to the union. The raises would take place in each year of the three-year contract. They do not include a cost-of-living adjustment. TARC claims the union’s salary demands are unrealistic and would exceed TARC’s annual budget, which is set by Louisville’s mayor and Metro Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Prohibitions against nonunanimous jury convictions – outlawed by Louisiana voters in 2018 and, later, by the U.S. Supreme Court – do not have to apply retroactively to earlier convictions, Louisiana’s highest court ruled Friday. The ruling came in the case of Reginald Reddick, convicted of murder by a 10-2 jury vote in 1997, but the court acknowledged it had implications for hundreds of others convicted with 10-2 or 11-1 jury votes. In 2018, Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting nonunanimous verdicts in trials for crimes committed after Jan. 1, 2019. At the time, Louisiana was one of only two states allowing such verdicts. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that nonunanimous verdicts were unconstitutional, broadening the effect of the state constitutional amendment. But in 2021, the Supreme Court made clear in a case known as Ramos v. Louisiana that its decision against nonunanimous verdicts applied only to future cases and cases in which the defendants’ appeals had not been exhausted. Friday’s state high court majority ruling by Justice Scott Crichton cited the Ramos case and other jurisprudence in determining that neither federal nor state law required a retroactive application of the prohibition.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: A Republican congressional hopeful in a highly competitive race is spreading misinformation about the state’s housing policies, public housing directors said. Former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin is challenging Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who narrowly defeated the Republican in 2018. During his campaign, Poliquin has relayed a story about a woman living in her car who allegedly told him she was taken off a housing list because of immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Poliquin, who has focused his campaign on issues such as curtailing immigration and protecting gun rights, used the anecdote as part of his argument for increased border security. The Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors rebuked the story on Thursday with a statement to the Bangor Daily News that did not name the candidate but came in response to his statements. The statement said: “Such misinformation erodes trust in the public housing system on which so many individuals and families depend for safe, quality affordable housing, and it cannot be left uncorrected.” Eligibility for federal housing assistance is limited to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who have eligible immigration status, federal rules state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A video shows Republican Dan Cox, who is running for governor, accepting a gift from a young man wearing a shirt with a Proud Boys insignia during the candidate’s primary victory party this summer. The video, obtained by The Washington Post, shows Cox accepting a comb from him. “Here, this is a present from Maryland Proud Boys to you,” the young man said in video footage publicly posted on Cox’s Vimeo account. Members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, were involved in storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After accepting the gift, Cox asked the man’s name and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you,” Cox said, before greeting other supporters. The Washington Post reports the clip was removed after the newspaper contacted Cox’s campaign, which responded with a statement denying an association with the young man. “In the noise of the victory celebration, it was hard to hear what was being said,” Cox said, adding that he was surprised by the man handing him something and that “frankly, I did not even keep the comb.” Cox has reiterated false claims that the 2020 presidential election “was stolen” from Donald Trump, and he volunteered to help decertify results in Pennsylvania. He has also issued denials and apologies about his conduct surrounding Jan. 6. Although he said he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally, he has said he left before the march to the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: A nearly three-week strike by truckers at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor has come to an end with a new labor agreement, the Teamsters union said. The five-year agreement includes an immediate $5 per hour pay raise, an $11 per hour raise over the course of the agreement, improved retirement benefits, and keeps drivers on the union health insurance plan, the Teamsters Local 653 said in a Facebook post Thursday. About 300 workers at the Sysco facility in Plympton south of Boston went on strike Oct. 1. “I’ve never been prouder to be a Teamster. This fight proves that we truly are the biggest, fastest, strongest union in the world,” Local 653 shop steward Kevin Whitten said. “This strike brought members together like never before and built solidarity that will continue for years to come.” An email seeking comment was left Friday with a spokesperson for Houston-based Sysco. More than a dozen picketers at the facility were arrested early Monday after blocking the exits with tractor-trailers and preventing some employees from leaving. Sysco, which has distribution facilities across the country, supplies food to schools, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants and other businesses. The Plympton facility remained operational during the strike with third-party drivers.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A teenager accused of killing four fellow students and injuring more at his high school is expected to plead guilty to murder this week, authorities said Friday. Ethan Crumbley had created images of violence during a classroom assignment last November but was not sent home from Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. He pulled out a gun a few hours later and committed a mass shooting. Authorities have pinned some responsibility on Crumbley’s parents, portraying them as a dysfunctional pair who ignored their son’s mental health needs and happily provided a gun as a gift just days before the attack. They also face charges. Crumbley, 16, is due in court Monday. “We can confirm that the shooter is expected to plead guilty to all 24 charges, including terrorism, and the prosecutor has notified the victims,” said David Williams, chief assistant prosecutor in Oakland County. A message seeking comment was left for the boy’s lawyers. Crumbley was 15 when the shooting occurred at Oxford High, roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death are heading to trial on state aiding and abetting counts, the third and likely final criminal proceeding in a killing that mobilized protesters worldwide against racial injustice in policing. J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted of federal counts for violating Floyd’s civil rights and begun serving those sentences. Many witnesses expected to testify at their state trial have already done so at both their federal trial and at the state trial against their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. While much of the evidence in this proceeding will look similar, there will be some key differences. Jury selection gets underway Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: Hundreds of people applauded – and some wiped away tears – as the community unveiled a larger-than-life statue of Emmett Till on Friday, not far from where white men kidnapped and killed the Black teenager over accusations he had flirted with a white woman in a country store. “Change has come, and it will continue to happen,” Madison Harper, a senior at Leflore County High School, told a racially diverse audience at the statue’s dedication. “Decades ago, our parents and grandparents could not envision that a moment like today would transpire.” The 1955 lynching became a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago so the world could see the horrors inflicted on her 14-year-old son. Jet magazine published photos of his mutilated body, which was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. The 9-foot-tall bronze statue in Greenwood’s Rail Spike Park is a jaunty depiction of the living Till in slacks, dress shirt and tie with one hand on the brim of a hat. The rhythm and blues song “Wake Up, Everybody” played as workers pulled a tarp off the figure. Dozens of people surged forward, shooting photos and video on cellphones.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a top Republican prospect for governor, wants to block public funding for library books that might appeal to the “prurient” – meaning sexual – interests of minors. Ashcroft proposed the new rule on libraries last week. It does not include a more-detailed definition or include examples of which specific books would be restricted as appealing sexually to children or teenagers. In a statement, the Missouri Library Association called Ashcroft’s rule “an infringement on the professional judgment of librarians, and an effort to further stoke division in the communities that libraries serve.” The group warned that small and urban libraries, which rely most on state funding, would face the greatest impact from the policy. Ashcroft on Friday said he didn’t propose the rule in response to any particular book but hoped it would prevent potential issues. “I know that a lot of Missouri libraries are doing a good job on this and reflecting the values of the taxpayers that paid for the materials,” Ashcroft said. “But I just think it’s good to have some guidelines to make sure that we’re reinforcing that parents are in control.” The proposal would require state-funded libraries to adopt policies on the age-appropriateness of literature, which is already common at both school and public libraries in the state. And under the rule, anyone could challenge access to books. The proposal is what’s known as an administrative rule, which would have the same effect as a law if enacted.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two physician groups have asked state election officials to issue a correction to statements printed in a voter information pamphlet that they argue are false and and could confuse voters as they consider an abortion-related ballot measure. The complaint comes from two groups that oppose a referendum that would raise the prospect of criminal charges for health care providers unless they take “all medically appropriate and reasonable actions to preserve the life” of an infant born alive, including after an attempted abortion. At issue is language in the pamphlet written by supporters that explains the proposed measure. Supporters say the referendum requires medical care to be provided if an infant is born alive after induced labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion or other method. The physicians say that supporters dropped a word from the language of the proposal and that the law, if passed, would also apply to an infant born as a result of natural labor, even if a fetus was born extremely preterm, and regardless of the infant’s prognosis or the family’s wishes. The complaint was made Friday by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology on Friday. They asked the Montana Secretary of State’s Office to issue a correction to statements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific delivered 13% more profit in the third quarter, but the railroad predicted Thursday that its customers will ship fewer items than it expected, confirming the economy is slowing down in the face of soaring inflation. The Omaha-based railroad said it now expects the number of shipments it handles to be up about 3% this year and match the third-quarter number. Previously, Union Pacific had predicted that volume would be up 4% to 5% this year. “I have no idea if we’re in a recession or one is looming,” UP CEO Lance Fritz said. “I do know that the economy is slowing down.” Union Pacific reported $1.9 billion profit, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter. That’s up from $1.67 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year ago, but this year’s results were weighed down because the new contracts the railroads agreed to with their 12 unions cost $114 million more than Union Pacific had been planning on. Without that one-time charge for the new contracts, which only half of the unions have approved, Union Pacific would have reported earnings per share of $3.19. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.06 per share.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A rural county can start hand-counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, but it won’t be allowed to livestream the tallying and must make other changes to its plans. The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County’s plan to start hand-counting votes this week. The ACLU said in its lawsuit that the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said that rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive and that the county violated state law with its “stringent signature verification” for voter ID. Located between Las Vegas and Reno, rural Nye County was one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. Alongside the primary machine tabulation process, Interim County Clerk Mark Kampf’s plans to publicly hand-count all paper ballots. The hand count was first proposed to county commissioners by Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant in response to false claims about Dominion voting machines. Sadmira Ramic, the ACLU of Nevada’s voting rights attorney, praised the ruling.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: A small plane crashed into a building, killing the two people on board and sparking a large fire on the ground, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Saturday that a single-engine Beechcraft Sierra aircraft crashed into a building north of Keene Dillant-Hopkins Airport in Keene on Friday evening. City officials said on their Facebook page that no one was injured in the building hit by the plane but that “those on the plane have perished.” “The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. The NTSB will be in charge of the investigation and will provide additional updates,” the FAA said. Keene Mayor George Hansel told the Associated Press that two people on the plane died but that they have not been identified. He said the the plane hit a two-story barn connected to a multi-family apartment building. All eight people were evacuated from the apartment building due to the subsequent fire. At a morning press conference, Hansel said the plane was owned by Monadnock Aviation, which is based at the airport. He said it was unclear where the plane was headed, and no one answered the phone at Monadnock. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and the operations at the airport were not affected, he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s new K-12 public school mental health plan is facing lots of opposition from state lawmakers who say they won’t back its proposal to eliminate the decades-old School Based Youth Services program, which provides critical counseling and support for teens in low-performing districts. The School Based Youth Services program, set up in 90 of the state’s public schools, is scheduled to be eliminated by June 2023 to make way for NJ4S, New Jersey Statewide Student Support Service Network, an expanded and revamped system that would be available to all or most of the state’s 2,400 schools. Unveiled in October as a “first-in-the-nation” effort to centralize services and spread them beyond schools and into libraries, group homes and social service agencies, NJ4S was in the works for more than a year and created as a response to the pandemic’s teen mental health crisis under the guidance of Department of Children and Families’ Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer. But it was immediately met with intense criticism from educators and advocates who support expanding services but said the time-tested school-based programs must also stay.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Department of Agriculture will waive cost-sharing requirements for farmers and ranchers affected by the largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján on Thursday announced that the agency will cover cost sharing for emergency forest restoration, conservation and other environmental improvement programs. The move follows the approval of a massive federal spending bill that included $2.5 billion in relief for those affected by the fire and post-fire flooding. That bill included a provision to waive cost sharing for all programs administered by the USDA. The wildfire was sparked by two government planned burns earlier this year. It ripped through hundreds of square miles of forest and grazing lands, destroying homes and the livelihoods of many of the rural residents. Through no fault of their own, Luján said, residents lost large swaths of cherished lands and will have to grapple with the effects for years. “Our farmers and ranchers, business owners and families deserve relief to recover,” he said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: The victims of a racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket will be honored with a permanent memorial in the neighborhood, elected and community leaders announced Friday. The shooting “is part of the Buffalo story forever going forward,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. “We want to do something that people remember. A place to come and reflect. A place to honor. And a place to say never again.” Former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, whose 86-year-old mother Ruth Whitfield was among the 10 Black people killed May 14, is among those appointed to a planning commission tasked with acquiring land, seeking input on the design, securing funds and maintaining the monument. Buffalo NAACP President Mark Blue will lead the effort. “It’s not going to take the place of my mother or the lives of the other loved ones that were lost here,” Whitfield said. “So we will forever miss them and honor their legacy by what we do going forward.” The officials did not specify a budget or timeline for the project’s completion. Brown said numerous businesses and people have offered to contribute. Payton Gendron, 19, has been charged with killing 10 and wounding three others at the Tops Friendly Market. Investigators said he drove 200 miles from his Conklin home intending to kill as many Black people as possible at the store, which he targeted because of its location in the predominantly Black East Buffalo neighborhood. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: A man who was shot during a weekend concert at Livingstone College has been identified as a suspected shooter and is now facing charges, officials said Tuesday. The shooting took place Saturday during a performance featuring rapper Asian Doll at the historically Black college in Salisbury. Police are also asking for help identifying another person of interest. Salisbury police obtained a warrant charging Talib Latrell Kelly, 21, of Salisbury, with attempted first-degree murder, discharging a firearm on educational property and possession of a firearm by a felon, the department said. Kelly is not a Livingstone student, Salisbury police Capt. P.J. Smith said at a news conference. Officers were called to the campus about 11 p.m. and found gunshot victims and others who had been hurt as concertgoers fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Video footage from the event shows that a fight broke out while Asian Doll was on stage. Two male victims were taken to Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center in Charlotte with gunshot wounds, and officials also identified a woman who had a superficial wound to her neck, Smith said. None of the victims’ injuries were considered life-threatening, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A North Dakota farmer who had been detained in Ukraine since November 2021 on accusations he planned to kill his business partner is back home, the state’s two U.S. senators announced Friday. Kurt Groszhans, from Ashley, North Dakota, has ancestors from Ukraine and went there to farm in 2017. The relationship with his partner, law professor Roman Leshchenko, crumbled after Groszhans alleged that Leshchenko embezzled money from him. Groszhans and his assistant were arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate Leshchenko, who was then Ukraine’s agriculture minister. Groszhans said in a statement Friday that the Ukrainian officials made up the charges in an “effort to shut me up” after he discovered corruption “at the highest levels” of the government. “I am grateful to be home after this horrible ordeal,” Groszhans said in a statement. “My family and supporters worked tirelessly over a long period of time to make this happen and it was nice to be able to celebrate my birthday on North Dakota soil. The fact they refused to classify me as a wrongful detainee was an unfortunate and politically cowardly act that cost me almost a year of my life,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state of Ohio will not require the COVID-19 vaccine for school students despite a recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel. A panel with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the federal government’s list of routinely recommended vaccinations. The panel’s decision, likely to be adopted by the CDC director, formally adds the shot to a list often used by schools and health officials in making vaccination requirements. Ohio leaders made it clear Friday that the vaccine would not be required for Ohio students. “The State of Ohio does not mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for school attendance. The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) vote does not change Ohio law. The state’s list of required vaccines can only be changed through legislation,” Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said in a statement. Indeed, not every vaccine on the list has been adopted by Ohio as a requirement for schoolchildren, such as flu shots. A list of required vaccines for schools and child care in Ohio can be viewed on the Ohio Department of Health website.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A private foundation has raised more than $6 million to build a residence for future Oklahoma governors and their families, under a plan that calls for the current mansion near the state Capitol to be used for official meetings and special events, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt and people involved in the project. Talks about building a new home on the mansion grounds predate Stitt’s inauguration in 2019 and grew out of concerns about the cost of renovating the century-old structure. Stitt told reporters on Wednesday that he and his family – who lived only temporarily in the mansion – would not live in the new residence if he wins a second term next month. “It will not benefit Gov. Stitt,” he said. The foundation, Friends of the Mansion, is expected to announce plans for the residence after the Nov. 8 election. The foundation was created in 1995 by former Gov. Frank Keating and former first lady Cathy Keating to pay for renovations and additions. The new residence is envisioned for land behind the current mansion. Plans would have to be approved by two zoning commissions that oversee the area near the Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The mayor plans to ban camping on city streets and move unhoused people to designated campsites, as the growing homeless population has become the top concern for the vast majority of residents. “The magnitude and the depth of the homeless crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said Friday. “We need to move our scattered, vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need.” The resolution would establish at least three large, designated outdoor camping sites, with the first opening within 18 months of securing funding. Wheeler didn’t specify when the funding would be confirmed or how much the measure would cost. The designated camping sites would initially be able to serve up to 125 people and would provide access to services such as food, hygiene, litter collection and treatment for mental health and substance abuse, Wheeler said. The sites could eventually serve 500 people. Oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and drug addiction. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, and there are more than 700 encampments across the city, Wheeler said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections chief wants legal penalties against two Republican county officials and their lawyer for what she calls in a new court filing their “unprecedented, reckless decision” to give an outside group access to voting machines during pending litigation on that subject. Lawyers for acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman last week asked the state Supreme Court to hold in contempt the two Fulton County commissioners and to dismiss the litigation that had been scheduled for oral argument before the justices this week. Chapman was appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. On Friday afternoon, the justices appointed Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer as a special master to gather evidence on the contempt request and make a report with recommendations by Nov. 18. During their long-running dispute with the state, Fulton County GOP Commissioners Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch had allowed one group, Wake TSI, access to voting machines as part of the failed effort to locate fraud that might overturn ex-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat. That prompted the Department of State to tell counties they “shall not” allow such access to voting machines. Ulsh and Bunch were moments away from permitting a second group, Envoy Sage, to inspect the machines in January when the state Supreme Court put that on hold. The inspection planned in January was to involve computers, electronic poll books, ballot scanners and possibly more.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit claiming that Brown University failed to protect female students from sexual harassment and assault can move forward in part, a federal judge ruled last week. Four former students filed a federal class action suit in August 2021 alleging that the university systemically and repeatedly failed to protect women from harm, including rape, despite knowing that sexual assault on campus is “endemic.” Two current students later joined the suit. The university moved to dismiss the suit in March. On Oct. 18, U.S. District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr. allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief to go forward but denied their efforts to seek monetary relief. The plaintiffs were enrolled between 2018 and 2021. The plaintiffs can sue to force Brown to “ensure that the Title IX office receives, investigates and resolves complaints.” The plaintiffs must still prove that their suit meets the criteria for class-action certification. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or in activities that receive federal financial assistance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Months after accusing disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh of killing his wife and son, investigators and prosecutors have released few details about the evidence that they believe connect him to the shootings. That’s led Murdaugh’s lawyers to file a flurry of court documents requesting information from the prosecution, seeking to publicly weaken the case before the January trial has begun. The defense attorneys argue that there was unknown DNA found under Murdaugh’s wife’s fingernails. They also have a different suspect, Murdaugh’s friend Curtis Eddie Smith, arguing that he failed a lie detector test regarding the killings. Murdaugh has already admitted to asking Smith to arrange Murdaugh’s own death to defraud his life insurance company. Those defense documents even boosted a story from Smith that prosecutors later said had no evidence to back it up – that Paul Murdaugh killed his mother, Maggie, when he caught her with a groundskeeper at the family’s Colleton County hunting lodge, and the groundskeeper then shot the son. Alex Murdaugh, 54, has proclaimed his innocence ever since June 2021, when he found the bodies, each shot several times. He has said through his lawyer he “loved them more than anything in the world.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nVermillion: The University of South Dakota may welcome a new sorority chapter in the coming years. Alpha Pi Omega, the country’s oldest Indigenous Greek letter organization, could open doors on campus if enough students express interest, according to a flier circulated on social media promoting an informational session held Oct. 13. APO is a sisterhood of Indigenous women who are committed to each other, communities, tribes, families, academic excellence and self-empowerment, according to the flier. Its philanthropic cause is the National Indian Education Association. Hanna Delange, a spokesperson for USD, said nothing has been solidified yet with the sorority’s plans but confirmed the informational session took place as a chance for students to learn about the potential organization. Brooke Poppe, director of sorority and fraternity life on USD’s campus, said while there is no current timeline to open the sorority, the plan moving forward is on hold until there is enough student interest. It takes five or more students to start any student organization on campus. When or if Poppe receives a list of interested students, USD can move forward with the APO national organization in the expansion process. Poppe said her office hopes to have that potential list together by the end of the semester.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Employees of Bess T. Shepherd Elementary School blasted a recent nighttime prayer meeting over the school’s exterior loudspeaker, although district officials said it was an accident. An unidentified neighbor who could hear the praying from inside his or her home Monday night posted a video on the Reddit website that recorded about two minutes of a speaker praying over the intercom, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. “This went on for 45 minutes,” the video caption said. The video included a woman’s voice repeatedly saying, “We need you in this school, God. We need you in every school, God.” She spoke of casting the things of hell “back to the abyss” and said: “You cannot rule in this school. You cannot rule in the hearts and minds of the children.” The speaker also prayed over staff members. District officials said the prayer meeting occurred about 6 p.m. Monday, although they were not aware of it until Thursday morning. “There were staff members inside the building praying who were unaware the external intercom system was enabled,” district spokesperson Steve Doremus said in an email. “As soon as they were made aware, the intercoms were turned off.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Department of Public Safety fired an officer Friday who was at the scene of the Uvalde school massacre and becomes the first member of the state police force to lose their job in the fallout over the hesitant response to the May attack. The department served Sgt. Juan Maldonado with termination papers, spokeswoman Ericka Miller said. No details were offered about his role at the scene of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School or the specific reason Maldonado was fired. The firing comes five months after the mass shooting that has put state police under scrutiny over their actions on the school campus as a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers. Maldonado could not be reached for comment Friday night. Body camera footage and media reports have shown the Department of Public Safety had a larger role at the scene than the department appeared to suggest after the shooting. State troopers were among the first wave of officers to arrive but did not immediately confront the gunman, which experts say goes against standard police procedure during mass shootings.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox hosted the first of what governors across the U.S. are planning to be a series of new discussions on how states could address mental health issues. Neither Cox nor other governors involved are proposing specific policy solutions so far, but that isn’t the point – the idea is to listen to physicians, pediatric psychologists, educators, parents and others to try to find areas of consensus. Cox, the vice chair of the National Governors Association, is among a bipartisan group of governors who have joined NGA chair Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, in forwarding the “Strengthening Your Mental Health” initiative, with the ultimate goal of finding nonpartisan policies that states everywhere might adopt. Over two days at a roundtable event in Salt Lake City, Cox, a Republican, and Murphy, a Democrat, hosted a series of conversations on the topic, hoping to hear experts’ opinions on potential solutions connected to prevention, early intervention and resilience building. “Youth mental health is an urgent issue in Utah and nationwide,” Cox said. “The (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the problem, and it’s important that we be proactive in bolstering support resources and letting young people know that help is available.”\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff of the county where he served was charged Friday with simple assault for kicking a shackled prisoner, authorities said. John Grismore, 49, of Fairfax, was cited on the charge Friday through his attorney. He is due in court Monday in St. Albans to answer the charge, Vermont State Police said in a news release. Surveillance cameras recorded the prisoner being kicked Aug. 7. In the Aug. 9 primary, Grismore won the nominations of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot for sheriff. But after the video became public, he was suspended and then fired by outgoing Franklin County Sheriff Roger Langevin. The county Republican and Democratic parties gave their support to a write-in campaign by Sheriff’s department Lt. Mark Lauer, a 27-year Vermont State Police veteran who has been at the department for nearly a decade. Gale Messier is also running a write-in campaign. He spent decades in law enforcement including 20 years at the sheriff’s department in Chittenden County, Vermont’s most populous county. On Friday, Grismore said in an email that “the story is still the same” and that he had nothing new to add.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Belvoir: A “barricade situation” drew the FBI and other law enforcement officials to a U.S. Army base outside the nation’s capital Sunday, according to the official Twitter account of Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia. The base tweeted shortly before 1 p.m. that its law enforcement officials, local police and the FBI had responded “to a barricade situation” Sunday morning. “The situation is ongoing, & we cannot comment further at this time,” the base tweeted. It provided no other details except to say some of the gates to the installation remained open. The situation was inside a home, WUSA-TV reports. Fort Belvoir sits on about 8,800 acres of land along the Potomac River in Fairfax County and is located about 20 miles south of Washington. The base is home to several Army command headquarters, elements of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard and nine Department of Defense agencies, according to a Department of Defense website that serves the military community. The installation has 2,154 family housing quarters and seven child youth service facilities, according to Fort Belvoir’s 2022 strategic plan.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities said Friday that they arrested three suspects in the slayings of two people and shooting of a police officer after a daylong search on a tribal reservation in northeastern Washington. The Colville Tribes Emergency Services said on Facebook on Friday evening that the third suspect was arrested in Elmer City, one of several small communities on the rural reservation. Two others were arrested earlier in the day. The search for the suspects began after the Colville Tribal Police Department responded to a report of a shooting Thursday in Keller, a small community about 275 miles east of Seattle. Officers found two people dead, and an officer who came across a vehicle described as having left the scene was shot in the arm, according to the department. He was doing well after being transported for medical care, the department said in a news release. Police identified two of the suspects as Curry Pinkham and Zachary Holt. Robin Redstar, a Colville Tribal member and Nespelem resident, said she and other residents waited in their home for hours, and at one point one of the suspects was believed to be in a gully behind her house. Authorities eventually arrested a man in front of her home around 10 a.m. after he tried to enter her neighbor’s back door, Redstar said. Her neighbor, a hunter with guns, was able to detain the man and get him to the street, where a tribal police car was waiting, Redstar said. “It was pretty quick. Corbie (the neighbor) was giving him a good speech about morals,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Voters will get the final say on a ballot question that would amend the state constitution to give the Republican-dominated Legislature control over virtually every aspect of public schooling. The vote comes amid a fight raging nationally over the politicization of schools. West Virginia’s Republican leaders have joined politicians elsewhere in pushing to regulate how subjects such as race are taught in classrooms and funnel public money into alternative education options, including charter schools and voucher programs. Just this year, the state Board of Education joined a lawsuit against top Republicans over a school choice program – one of the nation’s most expansive – alleging it unconstitutionally drains money from public schools. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which sided with lawmakers. And in a state that once was a stronghold of organized labor, some see the proposed amendment as part of an effort to defang the most formidable center of union power left standing: public school employees. Four years after more than 30,000 school workers went on strike in one of the nation’s poorest states, igniting teacher walkouts nationwide, many say they’re overworked and exhausted.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A Milwaukee County judge on Friday denied a Republican Party of Wisconsin request to stop the city of Milwaukee from continuing a get-out-the-vote effort that the city argues it neither runs nor funds. Judge Gwen Connolly wrote that the arguments made by the party and Milwaukee voter Elizabeth Burke were “deficient” and that issuing such an order would chill constitutionally protected free speech. The lawsuit was one of two filed by the Republican Party of Wisconsin and other plaintiffs in the weeks after Mayor Cavalier Johnson made comments Sept. 12 about an initiative dubbed “Milwaukee Votes 2022” and referenced door-to-door canvassing funded by the “private sector.” Johnson’s spokesman then said the campaign conducting the canvassing is privately funded, and the city’s association was “limited to the mayor voicing support for the work.” The first lawsuit, which centered on an open records request, was dismissed earlier this month after the party said it had received the requested records from the Milwaukee Election Commission and Mayor’s Office related to the get-out-the-vote effort. In the second lawsuit, filed Sept. 28, Burke and Republicans argued that though Milwaukee Votes 2022 is a purportedly nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort, the city would partner with an organization, GPS Impact, that openly works to elect Democratic candidates and advance progressive causes.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: A hunter accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to fight off a grizzly bear attack in west-central Wyoming – the second such attack in a week’s time, officials said. Lee Francis, 65, of Evanston, was taken to the University of Utah Health hospital for treatment after the encounter Friday, the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said. Francis was hunting with his son in an area south of Grand Teton National Park on Friday evening when the bear attacked him. He was able to fire several rounds from his handgun, causing the bear to run away, but one of the rounds hit Francis in the lower leg, the sheriff’s office said. His son used a satellite phone to call for help just before 6 p.m., then began providing first aid. His son was able to help his father onto a horse, and they headed toward a nearby lake to meet search and rescue crews. Francis was eventually taken to the hospital via helicopter, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Wildlife officials had not located the grizzly bear, Sgt. Travis Bingham with the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday. Because it was snowing, Game and Fish planned to try to search for the bear again Monday, weather permitting, he said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/05/25/new-york-amusement-parks-midway-state-park-six-flags-ny-coney-island/7286044002/", "title": "NY amusement parks worth a visit: Midway State Park, Six Flags ...", "text": "Last year was a rollercoaster for amusement parks.\n\nReady to open with new amenities and attractions, all were forced to close for the entire 2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic and government-mandated restrictions.\n\nWith vaccinations on the increase and the pandemic easing, restrictions have loosened.

The incident occurred during Trump’s visit to watch the University of Alabama football game. The balloon, which is more than 20 feet tall, was set up in a nearby park. Jim Girvan, the organizer of a group that “adopts” out the Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an 8-foot-long gash in the back. In a news release, Tuscaloosa police said Hoyt Deau Hutchinson, 32, was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mischief. The orange, diaper-clad, cellphone-clutching caricature of the president is often taken to Trump appearances as a way to protest him. “Baby Trump” first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now, several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas across the U.S. It is unclear whether Hutchinson has an attorney who could comment.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: State officials said they need another 10 years to reduce air pollution by half in Fairbanks, but the deadline is Dec. 31. The Daily News-Miner reported that U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan proposed a bill to push the deadline as late as December 2028 to comply with smoke pollution standards. Representatives under Sullivan said state officials requested the bill. The state Department of Environmental Conservation said in a state implementation cleanup plan that 2029 is the earliest Fairbanks could reach federal air quality standards. State officials said a five-year extension could be requested if they do not meet the clean air quality deadline. Officials said a new plan for clean air must be developed if the request is denied. Officials said they are already developing that plan.\n\nArizona\n\nKingman: Mohave County in northwestern Arizona is officially on the record as a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” in support of gun rights. The county Board of Supervisors’ unanimous vote last Monday followed similar actions by some state, county and local governments to take a public stance on the issue. The resolution said in part the board won’t authorize county spending or other resources for “enforcing laws that unconstitutionally infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar and GOP state legislators Sonny Borrelli and Leo Biasiucci spoke in favor of the resolution that County Supervisor Hildy Angius called a nonbinding “statement of fight.” Mohave County Democratic Party Chairperson Mary McCord Robison urged the board to delay consideration of the resolution, which she called divisive and redundant.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Senate has confirmed a former Arkansas solicitor general as federal judge in Little Rock. President Donald Trump nominated 40-year-old Lee Philip Rudofsky for the U.S. District Court in eastern Arkansas. The Senate approved the pick Thursday on a party-line vote. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that Democratic Sen. Patty Murray from Washington argued against Rudofsky’s confirmation, saying he supported abortion restrictions when he was a solicitor general and opposed LGBTQ rights. Rudofsky had said he would follow Supreme Court precedent. Arkansas Republican Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton backed Rudofsky’s confirmation. Rudofsky served as Walmart’s senior director of global anti-corruption compliance. He clerked for judges in Massachusetts and Alaska. Federal district judges can serve for life and earn $210,900 annually.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg will soon be staring down at pedestrians in the heart of San Francisco where an artist is painting a massive mural of the Nobel nominee. SFGate reported Friday that Argentine muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is set to finish the artwork in Union Square sometime this week. Iglesias told SFGate he is donating his time to complete the work and that he hopes the mural helps people realize “we have to take care of the world.” He also painted a mural of Robin Williams in downtown San Francisco that has since been demolished. Cobre said he had been searching for a building downtown for a new mural when he was approached by environmental nonprofit One Atmosphere.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: Researchers continue to study a series of destructive avalanches in Colorado last winter. Some of the avalanches from March 1-14 caused unprecedented damage, destroying a home and a mining structure dating to 1881. Brian Lazar with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center told an audience in Carbondale on Wednesday nobody alive had seen avalanches that severe in Colorado. The center recorded nearly 1,000 avalanches but Lazar suspected the real number was closer to 5,000. The center documented 87 avalanches at or above D4, or fourth-strongest on a D1-D5 scale. Officials documented 24 D4 avalanches in Colorado over the previous nine years. The Aspen Times reported some mountains got up to 12 feet of snow.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new group has been charged with finding ways to improve recycling efforts in Connecticut and lower costs for cities and towns. House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz’s Blue Ribbon Panel on Recycling is scheduled to hold its first meeting Tuesday at the Legislative Office Building. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities in March said municipalities across the state have seen municipal recycling move from being a revenue generator for their communities to a growing expense as the market price for recyclables has collapsed. In January 2018, China stopped accepted lower-grade recyclables, leaving many communities in the U.S. without a market. The conference gave the example of Bridgeport, where recycling shifted from a $129,000 revenue generator to a nearly $400,000 expense. And North Haven had gone from paying no cost to $70 per ton.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The sound of engines revving briefly filled Wilmington’s Hilltop neighborhood Saturday afternoon when members of the Pagan Motorcycle Club gathered to remember a man who was shot and killed by a Wilmington police officer 13 years ago. About 30 members gathered near the steps of a home in the 1400 block of W. Sixth Street, where Derek J. Hale was shot to death by Lt. William Browne during an investigation of the motorcycle club. Browne was cleared of wrongdoing by the state Attorney General’s office in 2007. The group’s motorcycles filled the block, arranged in two long lines between parked cars as the club’s leader, Paul Fitzwater, shared a few words with the motorcyclists and residents looking on from their porches. After less than 10 minutes, their engines roared and the group left. Hale was a decorated Marine who had served two tours in Iraq. He had a son and a daughter. In 2010, Wilmington settled a lawsuit filed by Hale’s widow, Elaine. She agreed to drop a federal lawsuit against Wilmington after she received $875,000 from the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: On Nov. 19, the district will say one of its hardest goodbyes, to beloved panda Bei Bei, WUSA-TV reported. The 4-year-old panda will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo for China as part of the panda diplomacy program between the U.S and China. An agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association requires all cubs born at the zoo to move to China when they turn 4. Bei Bei will play in his outside habitat for the last time on Nov. 19 between 7 and 8 a.m. before he makes his way to Dulles Airport for a long flight. To give his many adoring fans time to bid Bei Bei farewell, the Smithsonian National Zoo is holding a series of public events from Nov. 11 through Nov. 18. Panda Cam 1 will focus exclusively on Bei Bei for the duration of his “goodbye week.” Through Nov. 17 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., patrons can visit Bei Bei in his outdoor habitat and write a postcard that will get sent to China with Bei Bei. At 11 a.m., panda keepers will be on hand to answer any Bei Bei questions. Bei Bei was born on Aug. 22, 2015, and was given his name, which means ‘precious’ or ‘treasure’, five weeks after his birth by Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, the first lady of China. Bei Bei will be accompanied by one panda keeper and a veterinarian on his nonstop flight to Chengdu, China, and the team will monitor him throughout the flight, and make sure he has a ready supply of his favorite treats.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Shark experts said the coast of Florida is starting to heat up with great white shark activity. OCSEARCH, a research group, said the annual migration to warmer waters off the Florida and Carolinas coasts is underway. The Palm Beach Post reported that eight great white sharks tagged by the Utah-based research group were spotted from New Jersey to Florida in the last week. Three other sharks that had been tagged were detected Wednesday in waters on North Carolina beaches, and two more sharks – Helena and the 2,076-pound Unama’ki – made their presence known with toothy grins just west of Key West in September. Unama’ki had been tagged off Nova Scotia in September. She’s 15-feet, 5-inches long. It’s not unusual for great whites to call southern waters home during winter and sightings are common near popular fishing and diving spots in Florida through spring.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service is giving visitors an inside look at the life of Union soldiers occupying a captured Confederate fort on the Georgia coast during the Civil War. Veterans Day weekend events at Fort Pulaski National Monument include reenactors taking on the roles of troops in the 48th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment was stationed at Fort Pulaski east of Savannah for a year after it was seized from Confederate troops in 1862. The Union soldiers stayed ready for a counterattack that never came. Weekend visitors will see how the soldiers performed drills, as well as cannon and weapon firing demonstrations. Exhibits throughout the park include photographs of the 48th New York Volunteers during their time at Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Navy said it is considering a new plan to use double-wall tanks to upgrade a fuel storage facility in Honolulu. Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday that the Navy updated its initial proposal to reinforce tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The Navy said if the upgrade cannot be completed it will relocate the fuel in 20 tanks that sit atop the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer. A 2014 leak of 27,000 gallons of fuel at the facility threatened Oahu’s drinking water and prompted calls for improvements. The Navy’s Sept. 9 proposal had favored single-wall tank upgrades with added monitoring features. The plan was rejected by a Honolulu City Council committee last month and was opposed by the Board of Water Supply.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers is looking at making changes to Idaho’s only independent performance evaluations agency, possibly by having staffers focus more on legislative budgets and less on whether state programs are working properly. The Office of Performance Evaluations does deep-dive research and auditing of state agencies and programs, looking for ways the state can fix any problems and become more efficient. Often the reports have uncovered big issues, such as increasing delays in the parole process, rapidly growing caseloads for child welfare workers and problems with the monitoring of state contracts worth millions of dollars. Rep. Wendy Horman, the House vice-chair of the legislative budget-writing committee, said her committee needs more staffers available to quickly research and answer questions about the impact of state budgeting decisions. But House Minority Leader Mat Erpelding said the right solution would be to add more resources to the budget-writing committee, not to cannibalize another office.\n\nIllinois\n\nOlympia Fields: A suburban Chicago post office has been named in honor of Robert Martin, an original member of the famed all-black Tuskegee Airmen who flew scores of missions in World War II. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who introduced legislation in February to name the post office for Martin, called him “an American hero.” Martin’s children attended the unveiling of a plaque in their father’s honor at the post office. He lived in Olympia Fields from 2008 until his death at age 99 in July 2018. Martin was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on Feb. 9, 1919. Before the war, Martin earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He was a captain when he was discharged from the Army in 1945. He then worked as an electrical engineer in Chicago until retiring in 1988. Martin received his wings in 1944 and was commissioned a second lieutenant, then flew with a squadron based in Italy. On his 64th mission, Martin was shot down by enemy gunfire near Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in March 1945. He spent a month behind enemy lines with partisans in a secret Yugoslavian camp before the Allied advance allowed him to return to his base in Italy.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The Veterans Day Council of Indianapolis has canceled the annual Veterans Day Parade because of the possibility of inclement weather, The American Legion, Department of Indiana said Friday. “The projected freezing temperatures and possible snowfall/freezing rain could not only create a dangerous situation for all involved, but it could also hinder operations to clear the roads along the parade route,” the group wrote in a press release. The National Weather Service said that along with bitterly cold temperatures, there is a chance of rain and snow before 11 a.m. Monday, and that rain is likely between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. There is also a 40% chance of snow Monday night, the weather service said. The annual Veterans Day Service will still take place, but it has been moved indoors to the Indiana War Memorial’s Pershing Auditorium, according to the release. It will begin at 11 a.m. Monday. The Veterans Day Breakfast, scheduled for 8-10 a.m. in the Murat Arabian Room at 502 N. New Jersey St., will not be affected by weather, the release said\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Appeals Court has ruled against a convicted killer who said he “died” during a medical emergency and thus fulfilled his life sentence. Wapello County court records said Benjamin Schreiber has been serving the life term since being convicted in 1997 of beating a man to death. Schreiber said his heart stopped five times on March 30, 2015, at a hospital where he had been taken from the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison. Schreiber filed for release in April 2018. A district judge found little merit in Schreiber’s argument, saying his filing confirmed he was still among the living. The appeals court affirmed that ruling Wednesday, saying: “Schreiber is either alive, in which case he must remain in prison, or he is dead, in which case this appeal is moot.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city will add the state’s first electric buses to its public transit fleet in hopes of saving hundreds of thousands of dollars and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The first bus is expected to hit the road this month, and an additional 10 should come into service next year, KCUR reported. The city’s transit director, Mike Tann, won a $2 million federal grant that allowed the city to purchase four new electric buses from manufacturer ProTerra. Tann also bought seven smaller electric buses from a company called Custom Coach Works, and those vehicles will replace aging buses that look like old trolleys and run downtown Wichita routes. Wichita Transit has also remodeled its bus barn and placed0 charges for 14 buses. Transit workers will plug in buses to charge overnight, which should prepare buses to run for about 150 miles by morning. The agency estimates each electric bus will run for 12 years and save the city $462,000 in that time compared to its diesel counterpart. Tann estimated every diesel bus in the fleet will be replaced by an electric- or hydrogen-powered bus as early as 2027.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Officials have removed drought declarations for all 120 counties in the state. A Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet news release said recent rains have eliminated precipitation deficits and improved stream flows and soil moisture levels. Statewide drought declarations were issued Oct. 3, but officials said precipitation since then has helped ease the moderate to severe drought conditions. State climatologist Stuart Foster said October finished as the third-wettest on record.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly $10 million in 2010 oil spill money is rebuilding a barrier island bird rookery off Louisiana. Work on Queen Bess Island had to wait for this year’s nesting season to end in August and must finish by late February or early March before the next nesting season. Queen Bess Island was the first spot where brown pelicans were returned to Louisiana after the pesticide DDT wiped out Louisiana’s state bird in the 1960s. Today, the island supports Louisiana’s third-largest brown pelican nesting colony, with about 15% to 20% of all nests in the state. But its usable nesting area is now down to about 5 acres. The island also was heavily hit by oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, but that has been cleaned and birds are back. Plans call for 30 acres of pelican habitat and 7 acres for terns and skimmers, smaller birds that nest on gravel. The $9.8 million contract with New Orleans-based Pontchartrain Partners LLC. is only part of the project. Engineering, design, operation, maintenance and monitoring will be adding up to nearly $7 million more, said Chuck Perrodin, spokesman for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Many pelicans have stayed in the area despite the construction work, and biologists said that’s a good sign, WVUE-TV reported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine troopers are preparing to issue traffic citations via computers in their cruisers. The motorist gets a printout of the citation, which is electronically sent to court. Trooper Anthony Keim, the first to test the “e-citation program,” said it’s easier to type out the ticket than to write out a ticket by hand. It will be rolled out to all state police cruisers in December. But it comes with a cost of about $1,000 per cruiser. That’s a problem for smaller departments but some of them are hoping grants might eventually cover those costs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A Maryland lawmaker said legislation is being considered to resolve a long-running lawsuit in federal court over program disparities between four historically black colleges and traditionally white colleges. Del. Charles Sydnor, a Baltimore County Democrat, said Friday he is working with other lawmakers on proposals for a settlement of at least $577 million. That’s the amount that an attorney representing the HBCUs has recommended. Sydnor spoke at a news conference to discuss a rally this week calling for a fair resolution. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has offered to settle the lawsuit for $200 million over 10 years. House Speaker Adrienne Jones has urged Hogan to settle the case for $577 million. Hogan responded that lawmakers could find ways to reach the higher amount in the upcoming budget process.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNeedham: A solider killed in World War II has been laid to rest after his remains were recently identified. WCVB-TV reported a memorial service was held Saturday at St. Joseph Church in Needham for U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joseph Edward Finneran. He was buried with full military honors in Mount Benedict Cemetery in Boston’s West Roxbury neighborhood, alongside his mother. The 22-year-old was shot down north of Bucharest, Romania, on Aug. 1, 1943, during a bombing mission. He was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and other military honors. Finneran’s unidentified remains had been kept inside a military cemetery in Belgium for 70 years, along with other Americans killed during “Operation Tidal Wave.” The Pentagon last month announced it had accounted for Finneran using anthropological and DNA analysis.\n\nMichigan\n\nBowne Township: Quick-thinking hunters in central Michigan rescued two deer who became locked in battle. WOOD-TV reported that insurance agent Mark Johnson spotted the rutting bucks in a field with their antlers entangled. He figured the eight-point bucks would die from exhaustion or starvation if they stayed stuck. Video of Wednesday’s rescue on WOOD-TV’s website showed Johnson’s friend, Brad Lyons, deploying a specialized branch saw to cut part of an antler. That enabled the bucks to pull away and run off. The rescue came a week before the opening of firearms deer season. Johnson, Lyons and another acquaintance who showed up to help are hunters and in other circumstances, the bucks would have been prized trophies. What they got from the encounter instead was a good story to tell and a chunk of sawed-off antler.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFergus Falls: Gov. Tim Walz headed to Fergus Falls for the 17th annual Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener. Walz spoke at the Big Buck Brunch on Friday to kick off the event. He met later with local fourth- and fifth-graders to talk about the importance of outdoor education. The governor was scheduled to head into the woods in Austin on Saturday morning for the opening of Minnesota’s firearms deer season. It was Walz’s first Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener, a tradition that began under Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Walz is known mostly as a pheasant hunter. The governor bagged a rooster Saturday in mostly wet and windy conditions. The Star Tribune reported that Walz was joined by Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan, state Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen, Explore Minnesota Director John Edman, members of Pheasants Forever, as well as local elected officials and Austin Mayor Tom Stiehm. Nearly 500,000 hunters are expected to participate in Minnesota’s 2019 deer season. According to a 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report, all hunting-related expenditures in Minnesota totaled $725 million annually, with deer hunting helping to support 3,760 jobs.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A monument is being rededicated in a national park on a Civil War battlefield. A ceremony is scheduled for Monday at Vicksburg National Military Park. The Vicksburg Post reported the monument underwent a $75,000 restoration funded by the state and promoted by a group called Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park and Campaign. Work included masonry repairs, testing of the monument’s lightning suppression system and thorough cleaning. It was done by the National Park Service’s Historic Preservation Training Center. The monument was dedicated on Nov. 12, 1909, and honors the state’s 32 infantry units, 17 artillery units, and 37 cavalry units that served in the Confederate Army during the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign of the Civil War.\n\nMissouri\n\nEminence:A herd of seven wild horses that was causing problems at a state park has been rounded up and adopted. The Springfield News-Leader reported that visitors to Echo Bluff State Park in Eminence were feeding the horses, raising concerns that someone might be seriously injured. That didn’t happen, but one of the horses chewed up a park visitor’s motorcycle seat. Missouri Wild Horse League secretary Carolyn Dyer said several cars received paint damage from horses in the park lodge’s parking lot. One of the horses even seemed to figure out how to press the button to open the lodge’s front door with its nose. Dyer said all seven of the wild horses in the park found homes with Missouri horse lovers.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Wildlife authorities are investigating the poaching of a mule deer buck in southwest Montana. KECI-TV reported that Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks game warden Justin Singleterry said the case involves a 4-by-4 buck that was found poached east of Corvallis in the Bitterroot Valley. An investigation determined the buck was killed on location and then discarded down a steep embankment. Nothing was taken from the deer and its meat was left to waste. A member of the public reported the deer poached last Thursday. The deer might have been killed days before it was discovered.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Wildlife officials are urging owners of small pets – even those in cities – to be vigilant in protecting them from coyotes. Coyotes are common throughout Nebraska, including in some urban areas where there are creek bottoms, green space with tall grass and agricultural fields. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission cautioned people against approaching or feeding a coyote. It also suggested not leaving pet food outside and keeping an eye on pets outside, even if they’re out for just a few minutes. Pets should be kept on a leash and not allowed to roam at night. The commission said most interactions people experience with coyotes are between coyotes and dogs because of the territorial nature of both animals. Coyotes typically avoid people, so attacks on humans are rare.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A 67-year-old man who became one of the longest-serving inmates in Nevada history after he was convicted of murdering a woman at a Lake Tahoe casino in 1971 has been released from prison. Michael Anselmo spent 47 years behind bars. His Nov. 1 release came more than a decade after a Nevada Supreme Court justice who previously prosecuted him as Washoe County district attorney recommended he be given the possibility of parole. Anselmo initially was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in 1972 in the killing of a 22-year-old co-worker at Cal Neva Lodge at Crystal Bay on Tahoe’s north shore. His sentence was commuted in 2005 at the urging of Justice Bob Rose to allow for possible parole. Rose told fellow members of the Pardons Board that, in those days, a convicted murderer could expect to serve 20 to 30 years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Anselmo did not have a constitutional right to parole. He was finally granted parole for the murder charge in June 2018 but remained imprisoned to complete his sentence for a 1976 escape attempt.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A plaque commemorating a New Hampshire man who was piloting one of the planes that was hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, is missing from the Portsmouth tree where it had been chained for 17 years. The plaque honors Tom McGuinness, the co-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by terrorists and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. A year after McGuinness’ death, his widow planted a maple tree in front of the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building in Portsmouth and installed the plaque. Seacoastonline.com reported it appears a bolt that connected the plaque to a chain was cut. City and federal officials don’t know what happened. Police were unaware the plaque was missing until asked about it by the news organization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Some residents have been getting an early Thanksgiving surprise. A gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys has been aggressively terrorizing residents daily in a 55-and-older community in Ocean County. Holiday City residents said the turkeys are blocking doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively when they are shooed away. The wild turkeys can sometimes weigh between 16 and 24 pounds and run up to 20 mph. The township has received dozens of complaints but said its animal control is powerless in capturing or stopping the birds because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection said the agency is aware of the issue but does not have further comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRehoboth: The Navajo Nation honored the life of a police officer who died from a medical problem while on duty. Friends, colleagues and tribal officials paid tribute to Sgt. Lamar Martin during a funeral on Friday in Rehoboth. A press release from the Navajo Nation said relatives described Martin as a great family man who loved his wife and children, enjoyed outdoor activities and liked reading books and comic books. His fellow officers recalled him as a mentor and leader who didn’t hesitate to share the expertise he gained in 22 years with the Navajo Police Department. Martin was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and New Mexico National Guard. He’s survived by his wife and five children.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is facing calls to create a $1 billion fund for climate change projects ranging from mass transit to aid to municipalities when fossil fuel plants close. A coalition of environmental and labor groups called NY Renews is asking Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo to include such a fund in his budget proposal. They said the money should come from New York’s general fund, and said additional revenue is needed to address climate change. Coalition members in an Oct. 28 letter to Cuomo said the fund could also support direct investments in renewables, environmental justice community projects and energy efficiency efforts for low-income families. Supporters said the fund will help New York fulfill a sweeping climate change law that passed this year. That law called for zero-emissions statewide by 2050.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A University of North Carolina system investigation about the former interim chancellor of East Carolina University determined he “probably consumed” between seven and 10 drinks over several hours while visiting popular student bars in Greenville. The system released late Friday a report from a law firm it hired to investigate events involving Dan Gerlach in late September and anonymous emails sent to university leaders about him. Videos and photos on social media showed Gerlach “interacting with college-aged young adults and taking selfies.” Gerlach was placed on administrative leave, then resigned Oct. 26 as another video surfaced. The report found the emailed allegations largely false. The law firm did find Gerlach ultimately drove a short distance home after visiting the bars. Gerlach didn’t respond to a text on Saturday seeking comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state will receive federal help for farmers and ranchers who struggled with an early blizzard and wet harvest conditions. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the secretarial disaster designation on Friday. Gov. Doug Burgum requested the help last week to help make federal loans available to farmers and ranchers. To qualify for a secretarial designation, a county must have experienced a minimum 30% production loss of at least one crop because of a natural disaster. In North Dakota, 47 of the state’s 53 counties report meeting that threshold.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: A law enforcement official said he has persuaded bishops of an Amish sect to install blinking lights on buggies to make them more visible to motorists. The Ashland Times-Gazette reported Ashland County Chief Deputy Sheriff Carl Richert has been working with local Amish and Mennonite communities for years to make their buggies and wagons easier to spot. Richert said the community that agreed to install blinkers is more liberal and modern than other sects. He said he has warned community leaders that if they don’t begin using reflective tape and lights on their buggies the Ohio Legislature could pass laws mandating them. A local Amish buggy maker has ordered about 200 battery-powered blinking lights and anticipates community members will generally be willing to use them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The state’s 35 tribal nations with casinos have rejected arbitration in a dispute with the state over whether existing gaming compacts automatically renew at the end of the year. The Tulsa World reported that the tribes said in a letter to state Attorney General Mike Hunter that they remain unified in the belief the compacts renew. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has said the 15-year-old compacts expire at the end of the year and wants to renegotiate them to give the state a larger share of casino revenue. The tribes pay fees of between 4% and 10% of a casino’s net revenue and receive exclusive rights to operate casinos in the state. The fees generated nearly $139 million for the state last year. Stitt spokeswoman Baylee Lakey said the governor is disappointed the tribes declined arbitration. Hunter’s office declined comment.\n\nOregon\n\nCanyonville: Someone shot a bald eagle to death in western Oregon, and the police want to find out who did it. Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife troopers are seeking tips from the public. The troopers responded on Wednesday to a report that a bald eagle was seen dead in Lower Cow Creek, in Douglas County. A photo showed the bird face-down in the water. They determined it was shot one to two days before being found. A reward of up to $2,500 is offered for information leading to a conviction. The killing, or possession of a bald eagle or its parts, is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHempfield Township: Officials said three trains were involved in a derailment in western Pennsylvania, prompting cancellation of rail service between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, but no injuries were reported. Three Norfolk Southern Corp. trains were involved in the derailment around 2:30 p.m. Friday just west of the Georges Station Road bridge in Hempfield, about 3 miles east of Greensburg. Norfolk Southern said one westbound train struck the rear of another, and derailed cars hit part of an eastbound train. A total of 11 rail cars transporting 50 shipping containers derailed, blocking lines that carry freight and passengers between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Norfolk Southern said in a statement Saturday that cranes, excavators, loaders and other heavy equipment were being used to clear the tracks, and service restoration was expected late Saturday night.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: State Police said a single-engine Rockwell International 112A airplane experienced mechanical problems shortly after taking off from T.F. Green Airport in Warwick at 4:45 p.m. Saturday. The pilot was heading to Long Island, New York, but had to make an emergency landing on Interstate 95 near Exeter. State Police said the pilot changed the plane’s direction to avoid landing in the highway’s busier southbound side, potentially saving lives. The plane landed safely in the northbound lane. The pilot and his passenger were not injured. State Police didn’t name the pilot but said he’s a New York resident with eight years of flying experience. They’ve also turned over the plane to the National Transportation Safety Board for their review.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: It’s about to look a lot more like Christmas at the Statehouse. The Columbia Garden Club said the state Christmas tree will arrive in front of the Statehouse on Tuesday morning. First lady Peggy McMaster will speak along with members of the club after the tree arrives. Then the garden club will start decorating. The garden club said in a statement that the tree will be fully trimmed and the lights turned on Nov. 24 at the end of the annual Governor’s Carolighting ceremony. South Carolina has put up a Christmas tree in front of the Statehouse for more than 50 years.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Officials said South Dakota has sold nearly 26,000 fewer hunting licenses this year, which has cost the state more than $1 million in lost revenue. State Department of Game, Fish and Parks official Heather Villa told the Rapid City Journal that the long winter, flooding and a decline in the pheasant population could be to blame. However, she acknowledged that the drop in license sales could also be a continuation of a decades-long decline in hunting, trapping and fishing. The department generally gets about half its budget from license revenue, and it adopted a resolution last month to examine the recruitment, retention and reactivation of hunters, anglers and trappers. Gov. Kristi Noem has created a live-trap giveaway and set a bounty on certain predators to encourage hunting.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Mitsubishi Electric said it is talking with a potential buyer for its Memphis plant. Mitsubishi Electric general manager Joe Durante told The Commercial Appeal the company expects the third-party prospective buyer would hire at least some current Memphis workers. He said the possible buyer has a U.S. presence, but declined to identify it. The facility opened in 2013, creating buzz as a high-tech game-changer for manufacturing in Memphis. The 212-employee plant opened with more than $45 million in state and local tax incentives, and included the company’s head office for its U.S. transformer business. Durante declined to disclose current Memphis employment totals. Durante said the Japanese company came across the possible buyer while exploring ways to increase Memphis sales through a joint venture, technology sharing or a sale.\n\nTexas\n\nTurkey: A newly released report has found a September plane crash in est Texas occurred when the pilot’s crop-duster stalled out after dumping hundreds of gallons of pink water during a couple’s gender reveal celebration. One passenger suffered minor injuries when the plane crashed Sept. 7 near Turkey, about 260 miles northwest of Dallas. A National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday said the pilot dumped about 350 gallons of pink water from the aircraft, which then stalled and crashed. Gender reveal parties for expecting parents have grown in popularity but mishaps can be deadly. Last month, an Iowa woman was killed when a homemade device that was meant to spray colorful powder into the air instead exploded like a pipe bomb.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah principal and teacher have returned to work from a week of paid leave after school district officials completed an investigation into a student dressed as a Nazi for a Halloween parade. The Davis County School District announced Friday the two Creekside Elementary employees have been reinstated but did not specify why they were placed on leave. Online photos showed a boy wearing a swastika on the sleeve of a long-sleeve dark brown shirt. Officials said the school district does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portrays or promotes hate in any form. District officials said it cannot discuss further details of the investigation. The student’s name or what disciplinary action was taken was not released. The United Jewish Federation of Utah called the costume “intolerably offensive.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Young people were in the forests of Vermont participating in a two-day youth deer hunting weekend. Anyone 15 years old or younger who successfully completed a hunter education course could participate if they obtained a hunting authorization and obtained a free youth deer hunting tag. The young hunter must be accompanied by an unarmed adult over 18 years of age who holds a Vermont hunting license. Youth deer hunting weekend is intended to ensure that young hunters get the quality training they need for lifelong participation. Vermont’s 16-day rifle deer hunting season begins Nov. 16.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The state has received 18 requests for funding under a new pilot program that will dole out millions of dollars to reclaim abandoned coal mines. The Bristol Herald Courier obtained grant requests submitted for the federal government’s Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program. The 18 requests ask for more than $24 million in funding; $10 million is to be awarded. The proposals range from outdoor recreation to agricultural uses. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy administers the program in Virginia. A department spokeswoman said the projects will be screened for eligibility. An advisory council will then recommend projects to the federal government for final approval. Clinch River Hemp Co. submitted the largest funding request. It wants $4.11 million for a project aimed at remediation by cultivating hemp.\n\nWashington\n\nIllia: The Nez Perce Tribe and Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission released 37 wild steelhead into the Snake River below Lower Granite Dam in hopes of boosting the number of spawning steelhead. The Lewiston Tribune reported the fish, known as kelts, were captured at the dam as they tried to return to the ocean after spawning in their natal streams. They were held for one or two years at Dworshak National Fish Hatchery to allow them to regain strength, and they were released Tuesday, ready to spawn again. Steelhead are unique among anadromous fish – fish that migrate from the sea to reproduce – in that they don’t necessarily die after spawning. Still, it’s rare for female steelhead to make it as far as the Lower Granite Dam to spawn a second time. Less than a half-percent of Snake River steelhead are able to make the repeat trip on their own, said Doug Hatch, a fisheries scientist with the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission at Portland, Oregon. The repeat spawners have on average about 5,000 eggs. Wild Snake River steelhead are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and this fall’s steelhead run is shaping up to be one of the worst on record. The kelt program is listed as one of the emergency responses that could be implemented when fish numbers are alarmingly low. The National Marine Fisheries Service said this week that steelhead numbers have declined steeply since a robust return recorded in 2014.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s Ethics Commission has determined that a panel of teenagers is subject to the state’s open meetings law. According to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the commission’s Open Governmental Meetings Committee determined Thursday that the Charleston Youth Council falls under the law’s requirements of advance public notice of meetings and agendas, restrictions on closed-door sessions and other provisions. Charleston Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin’s council aims to help seven to 13 city teens between 14 and 18 years old develop leadership skills and understand local government. They will attend city council meetings, perform community service and advise Goodwin on how Charleston can improve relations with its youth. The ethics panel was divided, with concerns about imposing onerous requirements on teenagers and other worries about creating a loophole that government entities might exploit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is proposing raising state employees’ minimum wage to $15. Evers’ administration released its 2019-21 state employee compensation plan Friday. It called for raising all permanent state workers’ minimum wage to $15 an hour beginning June 7, 2020. It also called for a 2% across-the-board salary increase in each year of the biennium and raises for prison guards. Their starting wage would increase from $16.65 to $18.22 an hour. According to Evers’ administration, the entire package is expected to cost $84.15 million. The plan is subject to legislative approval. The Legislature’s finance committee has authorized money to cover the 2% raises and the prison guard raises.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The Park County Animal Shelter in Cody began a three-week quarantine last Monday after a litter of kittens came in carrying the disease feline parvo. None of the shelter’s dozens of cats can leave and no more can enter during the quarantine. The outbreak has killed at least 15 kittens, including all nine in the infected litter. Shelter manager Valerie Swensrund told the Cody Enterprise a vaccine nearly eradicated the disease but some people have stopped vaccinating their cats. The virus damages the intestines, bone marrow and lymph nodes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/26/poultry-pardons-synthetic-frogs-freedom-rocks-news-around-states/40708429/", "title": "Poultry pardons, synthetic frogs: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Researchers are once again trying to determine whether the state’s Black Belt region has a problem with intestinal parasites called hookworm. A study led by University of Alabama at Birmingham is recruiting participants for a program that will screen hundreds of children in Wilcox and Perry counties for signs of hookworm. State health officials took issue with a previous study involving Baylor University that found evidence of hookworm. The parasite was once widespread in the United States and is now a problem mainly in underdeveloped counties. Health officials say poor waste disposal systems and environmental conditions in rural west Alabama put the area at risk for the problem. UAB announced the new program in a statement this week. The work is being funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Southwest Alaska’s Mulchatna Caribou herd has decreased to less than half its numbers, leaving wildlife officials with suspicions but no clear answers. KYUK-AM reports there were more than 27,000 Mulchatna Caribou three years ago, and the figure is now only 13,500. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says causes could include the animals trampling their food, heavy predation from wolves and overhunting by humans. Officials say the caribou are roaming more in their western range near the Kuskokwim River and Bristol Bay region, an area with more communities than the eastern range. Fish and game officials say surveys indicate more people are hunting caribou than suggested by the 238 animals listed in 2018 harvest reports. State and federal managers plan to respond with restrictions to conserve the population.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city will no longer use red-light and speed-enforcement cameras at intersections starting with the new year. A proposal to extend the contract for the cameras beyond Jan. 1 failed by a 4-5 City Council vote last week. Councilman Michael Nowakowski told KJZZ radio he voted against the extension because city staff never supplied him with the information he requested months ago. Phoenix has stationary red-light cameras at 12 intersections in addition to mobile speed-enforcement units that can be moved around school zones. Council briefing materials said the program generated more than $7 million in net income from Sept. 1, 2009, through Sept. 30, 2018, from more than 205,000 complaints filed in the city court about traffic violations.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: All University of Arkansas students are being required to have up-to-date vaccinations in order to attend classes following a mumps outbreak on campus. The state Department of Health on Friday issued a notice telling students they need to be immunized with at least two doses of the mumps vaccine or sit out of class for 26 days. The agency says nine cases of the viral disease have been diagnosed at the Fayetteville school this fall, and other possible cases are being investigated. University spokesman Zac Brown says the school has vaccination records for its roughly 27,000 students and has already contacted the 407 who don’t have current vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nArroyo Grande: Cal Fire alleges that fast food chain In-N-Out was responsible for a 2017 wildfire in this rural community, according to a lawsuit filed in San Luis Obispo Superior Court. The San Luis Obispo Tribune reports that Cal Fire claims the September 2017 wildfire was caused by a tractor mowing grass on In-N-Out property, saying it was covered in “dry annual grasses and scattered brush, which created a receptive bed of flammable vegetation.” The agency also claims that the tractor was improperly maintained and that the driver allowed the fire to spread. Cal Fire is seeking roughly $1.2 million from the burger chain to recoup costs. The fire burned about 245 acres in four days. In-N-Out did not respond to a request from the Tribune.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A survey of passengers who use the metro area’s regional transit system shows more of them would be willing to see service cuts if it leads to more reliable travel. The Denver Post reports the survey by the Regional Transportation District comes as the agency looks at whether and how to pursue service cuts amid one of its worst labor shortages in its 50-year history. RTD Director Judy Lubow called the situation an “emergency” that’s “just creaming us in terms of status and reputation.” In a survey of 13,000 people, 59% favored a temporary service reduction to better balance bus and train runs with RTD’s employee numbers. The respondents said they’d be willing, on average, to wait up to 18 minutes for a bus or light-rail train.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: A proposal to import five whales to the state has sparked a standoff between animal welfare groups and an aquarium that says the animals will contribute to its research. Mystic Aquarium wants to import the captive-born beluga whales from MarineLand of Canada in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The Connecticut aquarium, where belugas have been a popular attraction for generations, says the acquisition of the whales would enable research that helps protect the species. Animal Welfare Institute and other animal advocates disagree. They say the stress of importation would be too much for the whales, and it would make more sense for the scientists to come to the animals. The importation would require a federal permit, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is taking comments on the permit application until Dec. 2.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: More than 150 people are praying that the city reverses course on a ban that prohibits the display of a Nativity scene on city property. The mostly Catholic protesters gathered Thursday outside City Hall in Rehoboth Beach to ask officials to allow the display. They were joined by the Rev. William Cocco of St. Edmond Catholic Church, who asked city commissioners to let the creche return to its “proper place,” the Rehoboth Bandstand. The city ordered church officials to remove the display last December, saying it hadn’t been given permission to install the display in the first place. The city later announced plans to create an all-inclusive display for 2019. It’s unclear what progress, if any, has been made on that display.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Melania Trump opened the holiday season in the nation’s capital Monday by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree. Members of the U.S. Marine Band played “O Christmas Tree” as a pair of horses named Cash and Ben trotted up the driveway pulling a green carriage that carried an 18 1/ 2 -foot Douglas fir. The towering tree will become the centerpiece of Christmas in the White House Blue Room. The first lady appeared moments later, escorted by a military aide, and smiled, waved and chatted up the top-hatted men holding tight to the reins. She walked around the carriage and paused to look at the tree before posing for photos with the Pennsylvania farmer who donated it, Larry Snyder of Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Port Richey: No frogs were harmed in the making of a local high school’s science class. J.W. Mitchell High School began using synthetic frogs for educational dissections last Wednesday. Pasco County Superintendent Kurt Browning says it’s the first school in the world to use the technology. The lives of real frogs are being spared at a cost of $150 per synthetic frog. Tampa-based developer SynDaver received funds from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to help create the “SynFrog.” SynDaver says the fake frogs are made of water, fibers and salts and can be reused. Founder and CEO Dr. Christopher Sakezles says the synthetic frogs are also safer because there are no potentially harmful chemicals. PETA says 3 million frogs are killed for classroom use each year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A state agency says it has money available to help fund projects that give people a closer view of the state’s wildlife. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is taking applications for its Wildlife Viewing Grants Program through Jan. 15. The grants award up to $3,000 per project. The agency awarded money to six projects last year, including a viewing scope and platform at a nature center on Jekyll Island and a tower that provides shelter for federally protected migratory birds at Talking Rock Nature Preserve in Pickens County. The Georgia DNR says the goal of the wildlife viewing program is to create a greater appreciation for animals native to Georgia beyond fishing and hunting. A news release says grant winners will be announced by Feb. 21.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A federal transportation agency has awarded the state a $6.5 million grant to purchase new buses for Kauai and Hawaii Island. Kauai and Hawaii county officials say the Federal Transit Administration announced the grant Friday, but it is unclear when the buses would be fully operational. Hawaii County officials say the money would be used to purchase 10 40-foot buses on the Big Island. Officials say the buses would be used on existing and new routes, including from Hilo to South Kohala and over the Daniel K. Inouye Highway. Kauai County officials say an additional three 30-foot buses and three smaller buses would be purchased for Kauai. U.S. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says investing in new buses ensures residents have an affordable way to get around.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service has agreed to complete environmental reviews of 20 water diversions in central Idaho that a conservation group says could be harming imperiled salmon. A U.S. District Court judge on Thursday signed off on the agreement between the Forest Service and Idaho Conservation League involving the water diversions in the Sawtooth Valley. The conservation group says the Forest Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to complete consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries about the diversions. The Forest Service has three years to complete what are called biological assessments on each of the diversions that mostly supply water to homes in the area. The diversions are on tributaries or the Salmon River, which is home to federally protected salmon, steelhead and bull trout.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A planned one-day strike by some 2,200 nurses at the University of Chicago Medical Center has been called off after their union reached an agreement with the hospital. The Chicago Tribune reports that the agreement between the 618-bed hospital and the nurses who have been without a contract since April was reached Saturday morning. The union had planned to strike Tuesday, and the hospital had said it would lock the nurses out for another four days to guarantee replacement nurses a certain amount of work. That’s what happened in September when a one-day strike by nurses was followed by a four-day lockout. The nurses had been seeking lower nurse-to-patient ratios, but the terms of the agreement were not immediately made available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A foundation is investing up to $50 million to help low-income residents in the capital move up the economic ladder. The Lilly Endowment Inc., based in Indianapolis, says the funding will boost programs and projects aimed at improving residents’ economic footing and move them toward self-sufficiency. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the endowment is soliciting proposals from not-for-profit groups, including human service agencies, neighborhood groups and churches. The Enhancing Opportunity in Indianapolis grants will range from $50,000 to $10 million. Rob Smith, a senior vice president with the endowment, says an average of 180,000 Indianapolis residents experience poverty each year, and many struggle “to meet even their basic needs.”\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: Artist Ray “Bubba” Sorensen II recently finished painting his 87th rock in Albia, Iowa, leaving 12 rocks remaining on his Freedom Rock Tour of the state. During the tour, which Sorensen hopes to wrap up by late next year, he honors veterans by painting military-themed murals on large boulders in each of the state’s 99 counties, the Sioux City Journal reports. He has completed rocks in every Northwest Iowa county. In 1999, Sorensen asked permission to paint a large boulder near Menlo. The 60-ton rock had been a popular spot for graffiti. He painted “Thank you veterans for our freedom” and the flag raising at Iwo Jima. After the rock was eventually graffitied over, a group of veterans asked Sorensen if he would go out and paint the same thing for Memorial Day. Instead, he changed the mural. “It just kind of snowballed from there,” Sorensen says.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Universities in the state are reducing general education requirements to ensure more students can graduate on time and create more room for classes in their majors. Wichita State University became the latest school to slash the numbers of general ed classes their undergraduates are required to take. Schools are hoping students can learn skills such as ethical reasoning from an engineering course by scrapping philosophy and history requirements in favor of specific goals. But KCUR-AM reports that some liberal arts professors warn the change will remove an essential aspect of what a university education offers – a widespread knowledge of the world. Wichita State’s general education cuts were largely spurred by a Kansas Board of Regents mandate to reduce students’ credit hours.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Outgoing Gov. Matt Bevin has appointed three of his staffers to the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky boards of trustees. Scott Brinkman, the governor’s secretary of the executive cabinet, and Bevin’s state budget director, John Chilton, have been appointed to the University of Louisville’s board of trustees. Brinkman is also a former state legislator from Louisville. Chilton, an accountant, is also from Louisville. Bevin also named Bryan Sunderland, his deputy chief of staff, to the University of Kentucky’s board of trustees. Randall J. Bufford, president of Trilogy Health Services, was also named to the U of L board. Bevin named Sheldon McKinney, executive director of the Kentucky Future Farmers of America Foundation, to the Western Kentucky University board of regents. McKinney lives in Fleming County.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Disney movie “Frozen” inspired an assignment for a Louisiana State University class in modeling the marine atmosphere. The question: If the sea froze while the air temperature was well above freezing, could it bring on wintry weather, as it did in the movie after Princess Elsa runs across the ocean and freezes it? The answer was that, under some circumstances, such a change would be possible. Assistant Professor Paul Miller says he got the assignment idea after watching “Frozen” many, many, many times with his 4-year-old daughter. He set the simulations in 1840s Norway, using climate data from a set going back to 1851 – the earliest available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Taking a cue from Uber and Amazon, two heating oil distributors in the state are stepping up their game by letting consumers order quickly from their phones. The Portland Press Herald reports the first company was Heatable, which is owned by Dead River Co., followed by Order Oil Online. Both distribute in southern Maine. Both Heatable and Order Oil Online are aimed at people who are looking for the lowest prices and quick delivery – not furnace repairs or maintenance. David Simmons, the crew leader of Heatable, says the company serves as a “disruptor” in the marketplace by resetting customer expectations. Kai Nice, president of Order Oil Online, says he plans to drive people to the website primarily with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter campaigns.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Letting a balloon float away would draw a fine of $250 under a bill sponsored by state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties. The legislation is similar to a Queen Anne’s County law. Lam says he hopes the bill reduces the amount of waste that ends up in the environment and raises awareness of the need to properly dispose of balloons. He says there would be a $250 civil fine for each act of intentionally releasing a balloon, but no one would go to prison for it because it’s not considered a criminal offense. Lam says the state, unlike in Queen Anne’s County, will not allow biodegradable balloons. Because there is not a definite label that states when a balloon will biodegrade, they are still considered damaging and could affect farms, water and wildlife, he says, calling it a bipartisan issue.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nStow: The state is honoring its best and bravest firefighters this week. State Homeland Security Undersecretary Jeanne Benincasa Thorpe and state Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey will recognize heroic acts of bravery at the 30th annual Firefighter of the Year awards at Mechanics Hall in Worcester on Tuesday. Awards to be given out include the Medal of Honor, Medal of Valor, Group Meritorious Conduct, Excellence in Leadership, and the Norman Knight Award for Excellence in Community Service. Firefighters from departments in Andover, Boston, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg, Lawrence, North Andover, Revere, Rochester, Rockland, Saugus, Sudbury, Westborough and Worcester will be honored during the ceremony. Worcester firefighter Christopher Roy, who died fighting a house fire last year, will be honored posthumously.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials say the state’s drug overdose deaths declined last year for the first time in several years. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the state had 2,599 overdose deaths in 2018. That’s a 3.2% drop from 2017’s 2,686 overdose deaths and the first decline in six years. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state agency’s chief medical executive, calls the decline “a step in the right direction” but says much work remains to be done, including addressing disparities in access to drug treatment. Michigan’s opioid-related overdose deaths fell by 0.8% from 2017’s tally to 2,036 such deaths last year. That decline was largely driven by decreases in the number of deaths due to poisoning by heroin and commonly prescribed painkillers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Democrats say the decision by the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives to join a Washington, D.C.-area government relations firm as its director of public affairs is a conflict of interest. The Star Tribune reports that Stateside Associates of Arlington, Virginia, announced the hiring of Rep. Kurt Daudt on Friday. The Republican from Crown will continue to serve in the Legislature and as GOP caucus leader. Minnesota DFL Chairman Ken Martin called on Daudt to resign from one of the roles, arguing that he is “opening himself up to massive conflicts of interest by working for a lobbying firm” while serving in the Legislature. Daudt told the newspaper he will not be lobbying or working on any Minnesota issues in his new job.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Hardy Middle School now has a mural of the late, prominent author Margaret Walker Alexander. WAPT-TV reports the mural was dedicated last week. Alexander was part of an African American literary movement called the Chicago Black Renaissance. While in Chicago, she was part of the Federal Writers’ Project and the Southside Writers Group. She and her family moved to Jackson, where she was a literature professor from 1949 to 1979. She was the director of the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People and organized several conferences that were the first of their kind. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at the mural dedication that Alexander used her words to bring beauty and light. She died in 1998.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has elected an openly gay man as its next leader. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Rev. Deon Johnson will replace Bishop George Wayne Smith upon Smith’s retirement next spring. The election was held over the weekend at Christ Church Cathedral in downtown St. Louis. Preaching there Sunday, the Rev. Kathie Adams-Shepherd said the Episcopal Church “has not always been a safe space” for all, but a “new season is ahead.” Johnson is rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Brighton, near Detroit. He and his husband have two children. He says he has a passion for “social justice and inclusion.” The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has about 11,500 active members who live in the eastern half of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Yellowstone National Park officials report significant progress in reducing the number of unwanted lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that the National Park Service says Yellowstone and contract crews culled 282,960 fish this year from the lake. The total is smaller than last year and the year before that, signaling a decline in the overall number of lake trout. That’s good news for Yellowstone cutthroat trout, which suffered a major decline after the detection of the nonnative lake trout 25 years ago. More than 3.1 million fish have been removed in the effort to help bolster native cutthroat trout in the lake. But a panel of experts told the park in May that it would need at least another five years of suppression work.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission is releasing rooster pheasants at 14 wildlife management areas in time for the Thanksgiving weekend. The 14 areas are Powder Creek (Dixon County), Oak Valley (Madison County), Wilkinson (Platte County), George Syas (Nance County), Sherman Reservoir (Sherman County), Pressey (Custer County), Cornhusker (Hall County), Kirkpatrick Basin North (York County), Branched Oak (Lancaster County), Yankee Hill (Lancaster County), Arrowhead (Gage County), Hickory Ridge (Johnson County), Twin Oaks (Johnson County) and Rakes Creek (Cass County). The pheasant season runs through Jan. 31. Permits, including the nonresident two-day hunt permit, may be purchased online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A team of school police motorcycle officers is getting attention not just with tickets but with its posts on social media. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the school zone enforcement unit dubbed the “Fab Five” is racking up traffic stops while providing comedic commentary that might include photos of offending cars (emojis cover license plates), hashtags, memes and humor geared to an extremely online crowd. One recent post included “#JankMachine #MoreSqueaksThanAPetShop.” No one’s spared – not the Review-Journal photographer ticketed for speeding in a school zone on the way to cover the story, and not the school bus driver whose citation prompted the hashtag “#SchoolBusTED.” The crackdown is noticeable. Last school year, the unit cited 3,600 drivers for traffic violations. Just three months into the current year, it’s on pace to about double that number.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Another turkey will live free, not die, after a successful pardon plea at the Statehouse. In his third such request, Gov. Chris Sununu asked the Executive Council on Monday to spare the life of a 2-year-old, 18-pound female turkey named Joanna, noting that while the state abolished the death penalty this year, it doesn’t apply to turkeys. The council’s vote was unanimous, with Councilor Mike Cryans joking that he had no choice given the way the bird was staring at him. Joanna, raised at Birch Rise Farm in Sanborton, will join last year’s pardon recipient, Brooke, at Crotched Mountain School. Two years ago, the lucky pardon recipient was named Hale, after Sarah Josepha Hale, the New Hampshire native known as the mother of Thanksgiving.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy says the state has made a deal to buy a 1,400-acre farm in order to protect endangered species. The Democrat announced the deal Monday. The price the Department of Environmental Protection paid to Atlantic City Electric, which owns the farm, is confidential until the deal closes next month. Known as Holly Farm in Millville, Cumberland County, the property sits between two rivers federally designated as “wild and scenic.” Murphy says the farm has the “largest concentration of endangered species” in the state, and the land will help mitigate climate change. The DEP says a rare plant called the joint-vetch is on the property, along with other threatened and endangered species. The DEP says it doesn’t disclose their locations to protect them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A top official with the state’s court system says bail reforms are working, and the state is moving in the right direction. Artie Pepin, director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, appeared Monday in Santa Fe before a panel of state lawmakers. His testimony comes as critics contend the voter-approved system has allowed for the release of violent and dangerous offenders. Pepin disputed those claims, pointing to a new study by the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research that shows the majority of people released pending trial will show up for subsequent court hearings and aren’t committing new crimes. The researchers reviewed the cases of nearly 6,400 defendants over 21 months. Pepin says the study shows bail reforms are not to blame for Albuquerque’s high crime rates.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester: An intruder didn’t count on an 82-year-old woman living alone being an award-winning bodybuilder with nerves of steel. Willie Murphy tells WHAM she was getting ready for bed Thursday at her home in Rochester when a man pounded on the door and said he needed an ambulance. Murphy called police but wouldn’t open the door. Then the man broke in. She says she clobbered him with a table, poured shampoo in his face and was beating him with a broom when police arrived. The man was sent to a hospital. Police tweeted a selfie with Murphy, calling her “tough as nails.” Murphy works out almost daily at a Rochester gym and says she can deadlift 225 pounds.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Despite bouts of rain that fell in Haywood County over the weekend, the Cold Mountain Fire continues to burn, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Adrianne Rubiaco says. According to National Weather Service meteorologist Doug Outlaw, 1 to 1.5 inches of rain fell Saturday in southern Haywood County, in the vicinity of Cold Mountain. The fire was first detected at 3 a.m. Thursday on the summit of the iconic mountain in the Shining Rock Wilderness area of Pisgah National Forest, according to the Forest Service. As of Monday morning, it was considered 15% contained. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The entire 18,000-acre Shining Rock Wilderness area about 30-35 miles southwest of Asheville, including all 53 miles of hiking trails, remains closed to the public, Rubiaco says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An 18-week-old turkey got an official Thanksgiving pardon from Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday. Lilly was brought to the Capitol by North Dakota Turkey Federation President David Rude. He says the 18-pound turkey was raised on organic feed at his farm near Tolna. As part of the annual tradition, the governor pardoned the bird from being Thanksgiving dinner. The annual event also benefits charity. The Turkey Federation is donating a dozen frozen turkeys each to the Heaven’s Helpers Soup Cafe and the Abused Adult Resource Center, both in Bismarck. North Dakota isn’t a big turkey producer. Nine farms in the state produce about a million birds each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: The Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission says it is now providing free, reliable public Wi-Fi inside all 14 service plazas along the toll road. It says the upgrade replaces an inconsistent patchwork of systems that had been provided by food vendors at those stops along the 241-mile roadway across northern Ohio. Director Ferzan Ahmed says the new system offers seamless Wi-Fi access even at service plazas in more remote areas. The commission says the contract cost nearly $1.9 million, including Wi-Fi and 24-hour customer support for five years, plus equipment, installation and configuration. The project also included network connectivity improvements for turnpike operations, such as toll plazas and maintenance buildings. Agile Network Builders will manage and support the Wi-Fi system.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has hired a consultant to help devise a state Medicaid program as an alternative to Medicaid expansion. The Oklahoman reports the OHCA finalized a contract last week with Michigan-based Health Management Associates Inc. for up to $1.49 million during the next year to develop a plan. OHCA CEO Kevin Corbett said Gov. Kevin Stitt is looking for an experienced consultant to advise him on alternatives to Medicaid expansion, which Stitt has opposed. Last month, supporters of Medicaid expansion turned in about 313,000 signatures on petitions calling for a statewide vote next year to expand Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma to adults ages 18 to 65 whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level. An estimated 200,000 Oklahomans currently can’t afford health insurance.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: The carcass of a giant blue whale that’s been submerged off the Oregon coast for more than three years is being hauled to the surface so it can be reassembled, studied and put on public display. Oregon State University said Friday that the dead whale washed ashore near Gold Beach in 2015. It’s extremely rare for a blue whale to wash ashore intact, as the creatures can be the length of two school buses. Scientists removed 58 tons of its flesh and then placed the bones in the water off Newport so scavengers could pick them clean. The university says the 365 bones were brought back to land Thursday, including 18-foot-long mandibles and a skull weighing 6,500 pounds. The skeleton’s reassembly will take a year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State lawmakers, judges and top executive branch officials will collect another annual salary increase, with the governor passing $200,000 and rank-and-file lawmakers passing $90,000. Increases for 2020 will be 1.9%, a figure tied by law to the year-over-year regional change in consumer inflation. The boost takes effect Dec. 1 for lawmakers and Jan. 1 for judicial and executive branch officials. Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Saylor is the highest paid, pulling down a $4,000 raise to just above $221,000. Gov. Tom Wolf’s salary will rise about $3,800 to almost $202,000, although he donates it to charity. Both are among the nation’s highest. Most lawmakers, the nation’s third-highest paid, will see increases of $1,725 to about $90,300 in base pay. They also receive per diems, pensions and health benefits. Lawmakers in leadership posts will top out at $141,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Christopher Columbus statue has been vandalized for a second time in recent weeks. The statue’s pedestal was splashed overnight with what appeared to be red paint. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office said Monday that city workers had already cleaned it, and police are investigating. The statue was splashed with red paint Oct. 14, when the U.S. holiday named for one of the first Europeans to reach the Americas was being celebrated. A sign that said “stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. It was one of several Columbus statues vandalized nationwide. Elorza said then that he’d consider moving the statue from the city’s Elmwood neighborhood to the largely Italian American Federal Hill neighborhood. The Democrat wants the city to form a committee to review commemorative works, like the Columbus statue.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson: A judge has ruled a school board member couldn’t cancel his resignation by sending another email three days later. Anderson County School District 2 Trustee Stu Shirley sent an email to the board saying he was resigning immediately May 14 after a meeting over whether to buy out the superintendent’s contract. Shirley sent another email three days later saying he rescinded his resignation. But the board split 3-3 on a vote whether to let Shirley back on the board, and a lawsuit was filed. Judge Cordell Maddox ruled against Shirley, saying the board removed his photo, biography and email from its website immediately, showing the intent of the members.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Some tribes in the state are laying the groundwork for residents to begin growing hemp in the next year. The 2018 Farm Bill allows tribes to implement their own hemp programs separate from the state. While Gov. Kristi Noem and the Legislature continue their stalemate over legalizing hemp, tribes have been moving quickly to adopt hemp ordinances, create committees to oversee their hemp programs and submit hemp plans to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. The Flandreau Santee Sioux and Oglala Sioux tribes have already submitted their hemp plans to the USDA. Some tribes, such as the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, are still educating themselves about hemp and haven’t yet formally voted on creating a hemp program.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: More than 40 insurance companies are suing the federal government over its handling of a 2016 wildfire that killed 14 people and destroyed or damaged more than 2,500 buildings in Sevier County. The companies are seeking more than $450 million for claims they paid after high winds swept flames from a wildfire in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Gatlinburg and its surrounding areas. Five lawsuits filed last week in federal court in Knoxville claim National Park Service officials violated their own policies by letting the blaze burn despite prolonged drought and predicted high winds. It says they also failed to monitor the fire or warn residents of the danger. The park faces a separate lawsuit by victims of the fire.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Central Texas could be on pace for a ninth straight year of record-setting home sales, according to new data from the Austin Board of Realtors. Real estate agents sold 2,721 homes across the region last month, the board said in its latest home sales report. That’s the most for any October on record and a 17% jump over October 2018’s volume, the board said. The latest numbers bolster the chances that the five-county Austin region could end 2019 with sales at an all-time high, said Kevin Scanlan, the board’s president. In addition to October’s home sales tally for the Austin region, several other records were shattered last month. The median home sales price in the region was $327,500, the highest on record for any October and a 7.4% increase over October 2018.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Wildlife officials say the number of reported human encounters with black bears in the state has almost doubled since last year. The Daily Herald reports the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has received 53 reports statewide of incidents involving black bears since Nov. 7, and two involved physical contact with a person. Wildlife officials say there were 27 reports in 2018 and more in 2017. Officials say most of the reported incidents occurred between Salt Lake City and Santaquin, including in northern Zion National Park. Officials say the increased sightings could be due to the increased number of bears in the state over the past decade, but it doesn’t indicate an upward trend. Officials urge campers and canyon residents to secure food and stay informed with safety tips online.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: Local high school students are seeking a patent for an invention they think will help the maple syrup industry. Mynbc5.com reports the invention that measures sap flow was created by technical education students at the Hannaford Career Center in Middlebury. The device measures the flow of maple tree sap moving from trees through plastic tubing to a collection site. The students say it helps to determine if tubing is clogged or frozen. Maple syrup is created by boiling down sap. The Lemelson-MIT program has awarded the team a $10,000 grant to refine the device. The students have met with a manufacturer and with University of Vermont researchers, who their faculty adviser says were encouraging.\n\nVirginia\n\nLorton: A new museum honoring the women’s suffrage movement is set to open early next year. The Lucy Burns Museum is scheduled to open in January to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. The museum will present the story of 91 years of prison history and the imprisonment of suffragists who were arrested in 1917 for picketing the White House for the women’s right to vote. The Workhouse Arts Center funded, designed and renovated the new museum, restoring a decrepit prison building vacated in 2001. The museum is scheduled to open to the public Jan. 25. A grand opening celebration is scheduled for May 9.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials say it’s safe to eat squid caught in Puget Sound. KOMO-TV reports King County officials recently tested squid from the sound for metals and other contaminants for the first time in two decades. King County officials say the results show it’s safe to eat Puget Sound squid for eight to 12 meals a month. Jenee Colton with the King County Department of Natural Resources says pollution in the sound is contaminating fish. But squid doesn’t have a lot of fat, which means that it doesn’t store a lot of contaminants like other seafood. Dave McBride with the Washington State Department of Health says contaminant levels in squid are low. He says squid is a good choice for consumers and anglers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Sportsmen’s groups say they are not happy that they could lose about 4,800 acres of hunting land if the New River Gorge National River is designated a national park and preserve. The Register-Herald reports the proposal by U.S. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin would designate about 64,000 acres as a national preserve, with hunting and fishing allowed. The National Park area would consist of a little less than 8,000 acres, with hunting restricted. Some of that land already has hunting restrictions, but more than half does not. West Virginia Wildlife Federation President Jerod Harmon tells the paper the group will not support additional restrictions on hunters, anglers or trappers. The senators say a national park designation will boost tourism.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal report shows that the state’s job growth dropped dramatically in the first half of 2019, although economists say there’s little cause for concern. The U.S. Department of Labor says the state had 2,945,000 nonfarm jobs through June, up 9,340 from the same period last year. That lagged well behind the year-over-year increases for every June since the recession ended a decade ago. From June 2017 to June 2018, Wisconsin added 27,000 jobs. The previous year, the state added 35,000. Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, says job growth has slowed nationally and in many other states. He says a key reason is that unemployment continues to be low, at 3.3% in Wisconsin in October and 3.6% nationally. Winters says many business owners would expand if they had the workforce.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: New rules calling for disciplinary action against Republicans who break from the state party leadership’s views have exposed a rift between state and county GOP leaders. The new rules come after some county party leaders, such as Natrona County GOP Chairman Joe McGinley, criticized the state party’s actions. The Casper Star-Tribune reports members of the party’s state central committee approved the resolutions during a meeting in Lusk last weekend. The committee rejected proposals by Natrona County GOP officials seeking to protect free speech. The resolutions say the First Amendment “does not supersede the conduct and expression within the confines of a private organization.” They also say that violating the party’s principles, bylaws or rules of order “could subject a fellow Republican to a disciplinary committee review or disciplinary action.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/15/silver-dollar-city-thunder-silenced-empty-vegas-buffets-news-around-states/111962742/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state prison system said that a third inmate has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as the number of cases among inmates and staff continued to rise. Clarence Shepherd, an 80-year-old inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility, died Friday after testing positive for the new coronavirus, the Alabam Department of Corrections reported. The prison system said a total of 119 staff and contract workers and 28 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 .Twenty-nine of those staff members have returned to work. Inmate advocates and health experts have expressed concerns that the state’s overcrowded prisons would become a breeding ground for a deadly outbreak and urged the state to make additional changes. The prison system has said it is taking precautions such as distributing masks to inmates and quarantining infirmaries and other areas where there have been positive cases. The St. Clair’s infirmary, where Shepherd was housed, is quarantined, the prison system said. The Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in a news release that the department extends its sympathies to the Shepherd family and his loved ones during this difficult time.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Permanent Fund dividend was completed at $992 for each resident and distribution is expected to begin early this year because of economic impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, state department officials said. The state Department of Revenue said payments are expected to begin July 1 instead of in October. Residents who receive their payments by direct deposit and have been cleared for the check by June 19 are expected to receive the first disbursement in July, department officials said. The Department of Revenue estimated about 90% of all applicants will receive their check by July 1. Paper checks will be mailed starting July 1 to residents without direct deposit, officials said. The state budget passed earlier this year called for about $680 million in spending, which amounted to just under $1,000 for each recipient after people applied. This is the smallest Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payout since 2013, when a $900 check was distributed, KTUU-TV reported. Legislators or the governor have set the dividend amount during the annual budget-making process since 2016. A 2017 decision by the state Supreme Court said a traditional dividend-payment formula that was used from 1982 through 2015 remains on file but is not binding, the Anchorage Daily New reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In one of the nation’s COVID-19 hot spots, Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring residents to wear masks in public, and it seems a good many people agree with him. In shopping malls, restaurants and the crowded bar scenes of Scottsdale and Tempe, most patrons have disdained the use of cloth face masks that health officials advocate to help slow the spread of virus. Robert Fowler, a truck driver in Phoenix, wears a mask as required for work but otherwise he goes about mask-free. “I’m not worried about it,” Fowler said while waiting for a table Thursday at Snooze A.M. Eatery, where the patio was full and only employees were seen donning face masks. Despite COVID-19 case numbers trending upward, Fowler has no plans to change. “Everybody’s going to get COVID one way or the other eventually,” he said. “People are gonna do what they want to do regardless.” In a red state with a Republican governor, the trend seems to be to follow President Donald Trump’s lead. Get the state reopened and keep the face masks in your pocket – that’s where Ducey kept his Thursday during a news conference in which he dismissed concerns that the dramatic increase in virus cases might overwhelm hospitals. The governor did say he recommended wearing masks when social distancing is impossible, but he has rarely been seen wearing one himself. Ducey wore one when he met last month with Trump, who wasn’t wearing one, at a Honeywell plant ramping up mask production.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: There are 548 new coronavirus cases in Arkansas and one additional deaths because of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Arkansas State Department of Health reported Saturday. There have been at least 12,095 confirmed cases and 177 deaths in the state, up from 1 1,547 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 7,863 residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some Californians will again be able to get a manicure, a new tattoo or enjoy a massage starting late this week under new state guidance issued Friday. But studios and salons won’t look the same when they do open. Workers and customers must wear face masks, adopt far more intense cleaning practices for shared reusable items like tweezers, and the services will be limited – no mouth or nose tattoos or piercings for now. The guidance on nail salons has been highly anticipated. The Professional Beauty Federation of California sued the state in May to reopen hair and nail salons. Hair salons were cleared to reopen several weeks ago. Gov. Gavin Newsom also sparked anger among some in the industry, including Vietnamese salon owners who own a majority of California’s salons, when he alleged California’s first case of the virus spreading in the community was linked to a nail salon. He declined to give details, citing privacy. The services can reopen starting June 19 in counties where health officials allow it. They join a long list of other businesses cleared to reopen in recent weeks, including hair salons, restaurants, churches and movie theaters. Most counties have been cleared to move forward, though infection rates and hospitalizations are climbing in some. The state is monitoring infection rates and hospitalizations in 11 counties. Beyond masks, nail salon workers should consider wearing face shields or goggles to protect their eyes and wear a new pair of disposable gloves for each customer. Salons should even consider putting plastic partitions with cutouts for hands between workers and customers. Salons should also no longer display nail polish bottles on a shelf and instead ask customers to choose a color from a palette that can be disinfected. Technicians should throw away nail files, buffers and other items after each use. Fred Jones, public policy director and legal counsel for the beauty federation, said he was pleased Newsom cleared the reopening but disappointed it took so long. He said he’s concerned some counties will delay.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Colorado Tourism Office has launched a campaign urging people to practice safety measures and follow health guidelines when visiting the state during the coronavirus pandemic. Visitors are urged to keep their distance from each other and wear masks, in addition to normal guidelines asking people to stick to trails, respect wildlife and pick up after pets, The Denver Post reported. “We want to continue to make sure that the health and safety of both residents and visitors are the highest priority,” office spokeswoman Abby Leeper said. The office is working with the state health department on protocols and guidelines for businesses, communities and visitors to include in its “Care for Coloradans” campaign, Leeper said. The campaign also includes a new brochure and animated videos advising people how to dress for the weather and different altitudes and other helpful recommendations. The state previously discouraged any travelers from visiting the mountains because of concerns that smaller communities would not be able to respond to any outbreaks. “After the great sacrifices that have been made to protect our state, it’s vitally important to set clear expectations so we can maintain all the gains that have been made and stay on course to reopen Colorado’s tourism economy,” Director Cathy Ritter said. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order June 1 on the transition from the statewide stay-at-home order to safer at home “or in the great outdoors.” The office welcomed the order as more people are now expected to spend more time outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is allowing nursing homes to begin allowing some residents to meet with loved ones outside, wearing a mask and adhering to social distancing, months after Gov. Ned Lamont imposed a ban on most visits to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been particularly hard hit during the pandemic because older people are among the most vulnerable to the virus – but limiting visits was hard on residents and families. “We know that the social and emotional connection is incredibly important,” said Connecticut Long Term Care Ombudsman Mairead Painter, during a Facebook chat with families this week. Although many of the more than 200 nursing homes across the state have begun to allow these limited visitations, still strict restrictions are in place, said Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities and the Connecticut Center for Assisted Living. For example, families under most situations are not allowed inside the buildings. “It’s limited but it is an important step toward opening up visitation,” said Barrett, who said it’s still “much too early to say” when the more severe restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:Fourth of July fireworks are a go in Dewey Beach this summer, the only beach town that didn’t cancel or postpone festivities because of the coronavirus pandemic. Alex Pires, leader of the Highway One Group that owns local businesses like The Rusty Rudder and the Bottle & Cork, posted on Facebook Thursday night that fireworks were on after receiving a permit from the Delaware State Fire Marshal’s office. The permit shows that the 2020 fireworks will be held on July 4 on a barge out on the Rehoboth Bay near downtown Dewey. Pires said in an emailed statement that this is the fifth year his company has held free fireworks in the town and that organizers will work closely with police, state and local agencies and elected officials “to make sure folks maintain proper social distances.” Mayor Dale Cooke said the town has no role to play in approving the fireworks display because they’re set off from a barge on the bay, which is outside of town limits. It’s also run by Highway One, not the town itself. Fireworks displays, parades, concerts and other community events stretching into July have been canceled throughout much of Delaware in response to the pandemic, including being canceled in Dover, Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach. Lewes postponed its festivities until the fall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As protesters continue to crowd the streets of the District, a nonprofit set up free testing sites, so people can check to see if they have the new coronavirus, WUSA-TV reported. The nonprofit CORE, or Community Organized Relief Effort, set up the sites Friday and Saturday, after feeling inspired by the protests across the country. CORE brought the testing to the District for the first time last weekend, but plans to hold more next weekend and hopefully moving forward. “Protesting is our civic duty, and we feel that testing ourselves is as well,” Ann Lee, CORE’s CEO said. “We want to support our awesome amazing protesters out there really saving our republic, and we feel that this is our best way to do that.” Lee originally co-founded the organization with actor Sean Penn to “empower and support vulnerable communities, who have suffered from inequality, exclusion from opportunities, and institutionalized violence.” Now, they’re working to keep those communities healthy amid the pandemic. “Predominantly it’s low-income communities of color that are always the most vulnerable … so we see that there is a much bigger, much longer standing disaster that has been happening, which is racism,” Lee said. “Keeping protesters safe is for us keeping these communities safe that always get hit the hardest in all these disasters.”\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples:More than 80% of the people who live or work in Florida’s nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been tested for COVID-19 as the state approaches its goal of getting all of them tested. As of June 10, the Department of Health had coordinated on-site testing for 133,615 residents and staff of the state’s long-term care facilities. The department has shipped another 126,690 testing kits directly to facilities that indicated they could do the testing on their own. Combined, that means 81% of the 320,771 people who live or work in a long-term care facility have been tested, according to Department of Health data. According to the health department, 3,300 long-term care facilities have been tested, either by on-site strike teams or they were mailed kits. There are about 3,800 nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the state, according to Florida Agency for Health Care Administration records. The department has been shipping out about 4,000 test kits per day, excluding Sundays and holidays. Facility leaders said they can compel staff members to be tested, but residents can opt out if they choose. Long-term care providers serve the state’s most vulnerable population. About 85% of Florida’s COVID-19 deaths have been among those 65 and older, and nearly half have been connected with long-term care facilities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: The Park Springs elder care facility just outside of Atlanta took the unusual approach of having roughly 70 employees shelter in place on campus to protect its residents from the new coronavirus. It lifted that restriction over the weekend, and employees headed home for the first time since March 30. Nursing homes – among the hardest-hit places by the pandemic –– have limited visitors and screened people for the virus. Park Springs’ administrators said they feared those strategies might not be enough to keep their more than 500 residents safe. But the staff lockdown was not a measure they could sustain forever, said Donna Moore, chief operating officer of the company that owns Park Springs. The return home Saturday was bittersweet for staff, who gathered at a lunch before their departures to share their experience. Some cried and hugged each other. The company gave each of them a plaque inscribed with their names and a record of their sacrifice: “COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place 2020.” “Sometimes I said, ‘I can’t do this,’ ” O’Neil Marriott, a maintenance technician, said. But he said the rest of the staff gave him support to stay. “I appreciate everyone in here because you really made me feel like family,” he said. The staff walked out to meet loved ones to music and applause from Park Springs’ administrators. Some had carts loaded with shopping bags of supplies they had brought to sustain them during the lockdown. Park Springs’ lockdown started after four employees and a resident tested positive for the virus. They all recovered. Since the lockdown, the facility has seen two additional cases – both residents. One of those residents – a 96-year-old dementia patient – was visited by her daughter and a caregiver after doctors said she had little time left to live and then tested positive. She later died. The other tested positive after requiring medical care off campus and recovered from the virus.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: International college students who were unable to return home at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic remain in Hawaii with limited means to work and get food. Many foreign students were stranded in the state by health restrictions established to stop the spread of COVID-19 that shut down international travel and embassies, Hawaii Public Radio reported. Ann Hartman, dean of education at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said about 180 of the international educational organization’s students have remained, some living in the organization’s dormitories. Although the dorms provide shelter, other opportunities are sparse. “As international students, we are only allowed to work on campus, like coffee shops, or as graduate assistants, or bookstores and things like that,” said Uyanga Batzogs, a graduate fellow from Mongolia at the center located near the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during the normal school year, and up to 40 hours during breaks in the academic schedule, Batzogs said. The pandemic caused the University of Hawaii system to stop lectures and restrict services. “With our campus closed, now, as international students, we can’t find the jobs or try to work full-time during summer break at all,” Batzogs said. Seru Tagivakatini from Fiji said students like him rely on a $600 a month stipend from the East-West Center for expenses and face challenges obtaining adequate food.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: About 80,000 Idaho residents through early June have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage, state officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said that the overall number of people signing up for Medicaid has also picked up as the economy has struggled with the coronavirus pandemic. About 345,000 residents, including those who signed up through the expansion, are now covered by Medicaid. That compares to about 286,000 of Idaho’s 1.75 million residents who were covered by Medicaid in early September. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A network of military and veteran organizations is offering free wellness checks for veterans, service members and their families during the coronavirus pandemic. Illinois Joining Forces is a partnership between state and private groups, including the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, that helps service members and veterans navigate service providers through its Care Coordination Center. The center typically responds to requests for assistance on issues such as housing, employment or health care. Now people can request the center conduct wellness checks, either on an ongoing basis or a single check-in, for veterans, members of the military or their families. Brigadier General Ret. Stephen Curda, executive director of Illinois Joining Forces, said the pandemic has forced hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois to search for the help they need and navigate overwhelming options. “It is imperative that we meet them halfway – and in our view, it starts with a simple phone call,” Curda said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana entered Stage 4 of Gov. Eric Holcomb’s reopening plan Friday, allowing additional businesses to reopen and fill at higher capacities. But as the coronavirus pandemic carries on, Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box still has reservations. “Just because you’re not positive today, doesn’t mean you won’t be tomorrow,” Box said. Stage 4 of the reopening plan means restaurants can open to 75% capacity. Bars, movie theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues can welcome customers back at 50% capacity. Zoos, museums and similar sites can reopen, and gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed as long as attendees stay 6 feet apart. Unlike other parts of the state, Marion County won’t enter its next reopening stage until June 19, however, bcause of higher case numbers of the virus. Beginning Monday, OptumServe testing sites will also be open to anyone who lives in Indiana, Box said, regardless of whether they are high-risk or symptomatic.\n\nIowa\n\nJefferson: The Iowa Department of Transportation has temporarily closed two maintenance garages after an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus and had contact with two dozen colleagues, a spokeswoman said. The garages in Jefferson and Boone were closed Wednesday after all 24 employees who work at them were ordered to self-isolate for 14 days, DOT spokeswoman Andrea Henry said. Crews in both garages were working together on projects and had exposure to the infected employee, she said. Their work will be picked up by other crews in the area during the closures, she said. Henry said the agency sends employees home immediately once they test positive, and conducts contact tracing to identify anyone with whom they had contact. DOT then requires exposed employees to self-isolate for 14 days, and cleans and disinfects their workplaces. Henry said employees are placed on paid leave during their mandatory isolation periods if their job duties do not allow them to work from home. Henry said the Altoona garage was closed in May after a positive case there required 11 employees to be isolated. She said those employees have since returned to work.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A protester who attended a demonstration over the death of George Floyd in downtown Topeka last week has tested positive for the new coronavirus, health officials said. According to a news release from the Shawnee County Health Department, the person attended June 1 protests at the city’s Law Enforcement Center, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The department encourages anyone who attended protests that day to monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, the City-Cowley County Health Department on Friday said a 14 year old who tested positive for COVID-19 likely exposed people in Sedgwick and Cowley counties. The health department said the girl went to a sleepover and a public pool in Arkansas City before her test results came back positive June 10. The City-Cowley County Health Department ordered anyone who believes they might have been exposed to self-isolate for the next two days. The health department is offering free drive-through testing 1 p.m. to 4 p.m Monday at the Winfield Health Department office.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Kentucky Derby Festival has canceled this year’s Pegasus Parade and fireworks display known as Thunder Over Louisville, saying it would not be responsible to let the events go on in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The festival’s events were originally postponed until August and September leading up to the Sept. 5 Kentucky Derby in Louisville. Other events canceled for 2020 include the miniMarathon, the festival said Thursday. “As an organization that always puts public health and safety first, we know it would not be responsible for the Kentucky Derby Festival to put on events that attract crowds with not just hundreds, but hundreds of thousands of people,” said Matt Gibson, Kentucky Derby Festival president and CEO. This is the festival’s 65th year and the first time its traditional events have not been held in the spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Coronavirus pandemic closings have cost Louisiana casinos hundreds of millions of dollars, and one chain has told the state it might lay off as many as 1,500 workers. Monthly revenue reports showed that casinos lost about $347 million during March and April, with another $90 million or more lost by video gaming establishments, The Advertiser reported. And, though Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corp. hasn’t set actual totals, it has sent more than 1,500 employees at its five Louisiana casinos letters advising them that they might be laid off, spokesman David Strow said. The company’s notification to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board said layoffs are expected during the first two weeks in July, the newspaper reported. They include up to 414 workers at Sam’s Town Hotel and Casino in Shreveport, 354 at Delta Downs Racetrack in Vinton, 340 at Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, 246 at Evangeline Downs Racetrack in Opelousas and 170 at Amelia Belle Casino in Amelia. Strow said in an email that he did not know current employee totals.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The first Mainer to receive transfusions of antibody-rich blood plasma said he remembers dreams of two groups chanting while he was on a ventilator for 18 days. Richard Stevenson said one group was chanting, “Let him die, let him die, let him die!” while the other chanted “Go Rich, go Rich, go Rich!” Stevenson, of Vinalhaven, told the Bangor Daily News that he credits his survival to the plasma transfusions at Mid Coast Hospital. He was the first person in Maine to get the experimental therapy. Stevenson said he believes he was exposed in December on an airplane long before the virus became widely known in the U.S. He never knew for sure whether he had COVID-19 then. But his symptoms returned, and he tested positive in March. He was weaned from the ventilator little more than a week after receiving plasma donated by COVID-19 survivors. “I’m the luckiest person on earth, is how I feel,” he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Red White and Boom, the city’s annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration, has been canceled for this year. The decision announced on a Facebook post was made because it would be difficult to maintain social distancing during the event to ensure guests’ health and safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We want to give our sincere thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make the event happen and let you know how much we appreciate your time and effort. Fantastic Fireworks, our Sponsors, and our partners at the City and County level have assisted us up until the last minute to try to make the event happen,” the statement said. Although this year’s event is a no-go, organizers said they plan to be back in 2021 and “bigger and better than ever.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The University of Massachusetts won’t be holding its usual presentations at the Amherst campus’ Sunwheel for the summer solstice this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the public is still invited to visit the site at sunrise and sunset this week. Visitors should wear face coverings, employ social distancing and be prepared for the possibility of wet footing and mosquitoes, according to a statement from the university. At the solstice, the sun’s rising and setting positions barely change for more than a week, according to UMass Amherst astronomer Stephen Schneider. “From June 15 to 25, the shift of the sun will be less than one-fifth its own size. That’s barely detectable without astronomical instruments, so any of those days would be great to visit the Sunwheel to see the alignment of the standing stones with the rising or setting position of the sun,” he said. The astronomical start of summer is at 5:43 p.m. on June 20, the moment when the sun reaches its farthest northerly position in the sky, making that the longest day of the year. The UMass Amherst Sunwheel is located just south of the football stadium.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Eastern Michigan University is guaranteeing a single room on campus starting this fall for any enrolled student who wants one. The school announced its “EMU Single Room Guarantee” in response to physical distancing and other safety concerns because of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s for students living in campus residence halls who don’t want a roommate. Students who wish to have a roommate will continue to have that option. Single rooms typically cost approximately $2,500 a year more than a shared, double room, Eastern Michigan said. Under the new plan, the university is offering a credit to reduce the annual cost of a single room to $100 per month more than the cost of sharing a room. The credit provides an annual savings of $1,700 over the typical single room rate. “We have heard from many students and parents about this issue,” Eastern Michigan President James Smith said. “They question how students can practice safe physical distancing when they have a roommate in close proximity to them in a residence hall room. We understand a single room may not be for everyone, but we also know and have heard from many who desire such accommodations at this time.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents on Friday approved a $4 billion operating budget for the coming fiscal year as well as a plan to help offset losses because of the coronavirus pandemic. The budget outline includes freezes on tuition, system-wide hiring and merit pay raises for all employees. Separately, regents approved an initiative for temporary employee pay cuts and furloughs to help make up for $35 million in room and board refunds after students were sent home for the spring semester. The fiscal year 2021 budget beginning July 1 assumes a return to “near normalcy” with the reopening of campus classrooms and facilities in the fall, the Star Tribune reported. University leaders have developed two contingency plans in case the pandemic worsens and the return of students is pushed deeper into the fall. The budget “provides a responsible, by no means definite, base level of operations from which potential contingency plans can be shaped,” President Joan Gabel said during a regents committee meeting. Gabel’s COVID-19 budget includes a 10% pay cut for Gabel and her cabinet.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The Mississippi Department of Education is offering options for how schools can offer classes starting in the fall semester, with consideration for social distancing and other safety guidelines because of the coronavirus pandemic. The department has released a plan giving school districts three options: a traditional schedule, a hybrid schedule and a virtual schedule. The plan “outlines a three-month timeline of strategies for superintendents and principals to consider to plan for the start of the 2020-21 school year” and is “intended to be used as a resource and starting point for districts to consider local needs in collaboration with stakeholders,” department spokeswoman Jean Cook told the Clarion Ledger. It will be updated in to adjust to changes with the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. Jason Harris, Columbia School District superintendent, is one of nine superintendents who worked with the state to create the plans. “This isn’t a ‘You must follow,’ ” Harris said. “This is just guidance that people can use as a reference when determining what is best for their district.” Harris said although his school district intends to have the traditional schedule, he knows some parents might not feel safe sending children to school. That’s when the hybrid schedule or virtual schedule could be used. So, for the upcoming school year, students who study from home would have the option of watching their teacher’s lesson from a classroom webcam. The lesson would be recorded and uploaded, giving the student the option to watch it later.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson:The Silver Dollar City theme park opened its gates Saturday for the first time in 2020 after opening day was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 6,000 season pass holders made reservations to attend the park Saturday. A typical Saturday during the summer draws about 15,000. Season pass holders were the first allowed in the park on Saturday and Sunday; the park opened to the general public Monday for those who make reservations. About 8,000 to 10,000 are expected when the park opens for everyone. Those who enter have to wear a mask throughout the park except on water rides and while eating. Visitors are screened with COVID-19-related questions and temperatures are taken before they enter the park. Signs throughout encourage social distancing while reminding folks to keep their masks on. The park’s performers stay in character while wearing masks. Instead of buffet lines, food is delivered to the table. About every other table is closed in eating areas to keep visitors distanced from others. Carts on the rides are frequently stopped and sanitized. Indoor shows are closed, but there’s still music to be heard from the outdoor performances around every other corner. Saturday saw the opening of a new area called Rivertown that features Mystic River Falls –– a new water ride that has the tallest drop in the Western Hemisphere. The ride is still expected to open this summer.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock announced $8.7 million in federal funding for education interests.The funding comes from a U.S. Department of Education fund that gives governors the authority to distribute money to local education entities. This funding is separate from the state’s $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund. Bullock urged residents to continue following public health guidelines to avoid the spread of the virus. He said he doesn’t expect the state will meet the guidelines to fully reopen anytime soon, especially because other states are seeing rising case numbers and hospitalizations.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The past 12 weeks at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium have been perplexing for Dennis Pate, zoo director and CEO. On June 1, though, some semblance of normalcy returned when the zoo opened its gates with many changes and some cooperative weather. A few thousand visitors have strolled around the zoo each day since. The zoo has been open for nearly a week and looks much different amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a typical year, the zoo is open 364 – it’s closed only on Christmas Day. “It’s a step in the direction of normalcy,” Walter Jones, a zoo member who had three grandchildren with him Sunday, said of the reopening. And to be sure, the zoo is not back to normal yet. All indoor exhibits are closed, and visitors are funneled on a one-way walk around the zoo. More exhibits could open in the next two to three weeks, Pate said, depending on what visitor feedback is received and further evaluations of how the zoo can keep visitors safe. Along the one-way path are 50 hand-sanitizing stations, painted paw prints that visualize social distancing recommendations and concession stands with plastic shields between employees and visitors. Adhering to the state’s directed health measure, the zoo allows no more than 3,000 people in at a time. This week, zoo director and CEO Dennis Pate said, the zoo has seen from 1,500 people per day earlier in the week to just more than 3,000 people on Saturday. Pate described the zoo’s financial situation as “struggling mightily.” As a nonprofit, 91% of the zoo’s income comes from admissions, memberships and other sales.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The famous Las Vegas buffet has become a victim of the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down casinos statewide for nearly three months. Although casinos began to reopen June 4, the state has not yet given the green light for self-serve restaurants. With the highly contagious virus still circulating – it is usually transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets – the communal dining concept is facing serious challenges. At Red Rock Resort, a Station Casinos property, several restaurants reopened ahead of the rest of the property, but there was no timeline for reopening the popular Feast Buffet. Station Casinos is opening its properties in phases. Earlier this month, San Diego-based Garden Fresh Restaurants, owner of Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes with several Las Vegas-area buffet restaurants, announced the closure of all 97 locations nationwide. Golden Corral, with locations in Las Vegas and Henderson, reopened earlier this month by serving customers cafeteria-style. But Donald Contursi, founder of Lip Smacking Foodie Tours, said it would be a mistake to assume the Las Vegas buffet is gone forever. “Health and safety is at the forefront now, but I believe that, if Las Vegas has been reinventing itself over and over all these years, it will find a way to reinvent the buffet to ensure its guests are safe,” Contursi said. Larry Rogers, manager of the Southern Nevada Health District’s food operations division, said a shift to cafeteria-style service or having a server take buffet orders at the table will likely become common for the foreseeable future.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A racetrack that violated state orders during the coronavirus pandemic will be allowed to reopen this weekend ahead of other similar businesses. Riverside Speedway in Groveton held races in late May despite being warned by police that doing so would violate the state’s order prohibiting large gatherings. After being told the state was planning legal action, the owner postponed the rest of the season and then sued Gov. Chris Sununu over the restrictions. A judge held a hearing on the speedway’s request for an emergency order blocking the restrictions Friday, a day after Sununu announced that racetracks would be allowed to reopen Monday. While the case proceeds, attorneys for both sides agreed that Riverside could hold races this weekend if it follows rules regarding limited capacity, social distancing and cleaning. Joe Bassett, general manager at Lee USA Speedway in Lee, said he doesn’t think it’s fair that Riverside is getting special treatment after violating the order. “But he’s between a rock and a hard place, as all short tracks are,” he said. “We have limited time in summer to make our money, yet we have bills 12 months of the year.” Bassett said his track will likely reopen June 19, though it will be a scramble. He asked fans to be patient. “I’ve got three weeks’ worth of planning to make it work in a week,” he said. “But we’ll get things rolling.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The city backed off on its plans to offer indoor dining beginning Monday, in defiance of a state order. The City Council had authorized restaurants last week to offer indoor dining with restrictions beginning Monday, violating Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order. After the state sued on Friday and a judge issued an order temporarily blocking the town’s attempt, Mayor John Moor and the council released a statement Friday night recommending that restaurants not serve diners indoors. “We are advising Asbury Park businesses not to open indoors as we had announced earlier this week, as opening indoors would violate the court order and could jeopardize your business’s liquor licenses” and subject businesses to fines and other penalties, the statement said. As part of the second phase of the state’s efforts to reopen its economy, Murphy has authorized outdoor dining and nonessential retail to resume Monday but hasn’t authorized indoor dining. Murphy said Friday he would crack down on businesses that weren’t in compliance. Asbury Park’s resolution would have permitted restaurants to host diners inside at 25% of the building’s capacity or 50 people, whichever is fewer. Murphy has not indicated when restaurants will be able to reopen for indoor seating, aside from saying he hoped it would be “sooner rather than later.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, has asked parents for feedback after announcing plans to provide an online school experience for all grades because of the coronavirus pandemic. “Families have definitely indicated that there is a desire for some families to keep their children home,” said Deborah Elder, the district’s innovation executive director. “We just don’t know how big that desire is.” The district expects to launch an online system to collect input through a form or survey on the all-online school experience idea, officials said. It is unclear when that system would launch. Submitted comments could help the district gauge how many children are expected to take part and how many teachers would need to prepare, Elder said. An online-only education is a new concept for the district, officials said, adding that it would likely rely on parents, especially for younger-aged students, but they recognize not every family would be able to do that. The district is considering other options as well to begin the school year, including traditional in-school learning and a possible combination of in-school and distance learning, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Upset by “rampant” violations of New York’s pandemic-fighting restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened Sunday to pull liquor licenses of scofflaw restaurants and even reinstate closings in areas where local governments fail to enforce rules. Manhattan and Long Island’s tony Hamptons were singled out as problem areas by Cuomo, who said the state has received 25,000 complaints of reopening violations. He said the violations endanger the state’s fragile progress in the fight against the new coronavirus as it slowly relaxes restrictions enacted in March. “We are not kidding around with this. You’re talking about jeopardizing people’s lives,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. The warning comes a day after the Democractic governor reacted sternly to a short Twitter video from New York City of young people enjoying a warm day packed tightly on a city street, many without masks. New York officials are trying to avoid the fate of states seeing a surge in new cases after reopening. New York’s coronavirus-related hospitalizations are declining and the state recorded 23 deaths Saturday, the lowest one-day coronavirus death toll since the early days of the crisis.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPine Hall: Stock car racing has turned into the leading battleground over COVID-19 crowd restrictions in North Carolina, as track owners have taken their fight to reopen to the streets and to court. But on Saturday, a protest at one race track attracted so few people that the demonstration was legal under the state’s restrictions. The News & Observer reported that at 311 Speedway in Stokes County, fewer than 25 people showed up to protest, despite a live band and a free cheeseburger and fries with a ticket purchase. Gov. Roy Cooper’s coronavirus restrictions limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people. Even as the race began about 7 p.m., the stands sat largely empty. By sundown, the stands had nearly filled – hundreds more fans than the 25 allowed. But the protest had fizzled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: City officials are debating whether to ask voters in November if they should legalize fireworks within city limits. The Bismarck Tribune reported voters banned possession of fireworks within city limits in 1988 and affirmed that stance a year later. But Mayor Steve Bakken has proposed legalizing fireworks, saying families should be able to spend quality time together in the city during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think there is something we can do to clean this up a little bit and maybe relax some more statutes,” Bakken said during a city commission meeting. “People are looking for things to do with their families outside while social distancing, and shooting off fireworks fits that perfectly.” Commissioner Shawn Oban questioned why the commission was discussing legalizing fireworks when there has been no public demand for such a move. He also pointed to statistics showing a drop in police, fire and ambulance calls during the 1988 Fourth of July celebration after the ban was enacted. “I don’t see a hard enough ‘why’ to put it on the ballot,” he said. The commission planned to continue discussion after July 4.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:A petition to remove the mask requirement at the Kings Island amusement park had more than 3,800 signatures Saturday morning, according to change.org. Those with season passes can return to the amusement park between July 2 and July 11, and the park will reopen to daily ticket holders on July 12. But the reopening comes with new protocols, officials said. Guests will be required to make online reservations, socially distance while at the park, take temperature checks upon entry and follow other safety measures – including wear a mask. Kings Island states on its website that all guests, associates and vendors will be required to wear masks when the park reopens. The petition stated wearing masks at the park will be difficult because of “the heat and humidity alone.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: There were 225 new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma but no additional deaths, the State Department of Health said Saturday. There have been at least 8,073 confirmed cases and 359 deaths in the state, up from 7,848 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted a virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 6,495 Oklahoma residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department. Health officials on Friday warned of a spike in coronavirus cases in the Tulsa linked to indoor events and urged people attending such gatherings to take precautions. The warning comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s scheduled campaign rally in the city.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has asked for a list of names by June 22 of inmates eligible for possible release to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the state prison system. The state Department of Corrections was asked to perform a “case-by-case analysis” of inmates who are vulnerable to the coronavirus and meet the outlined criteria for possible commutation, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The criteria includes inmates who are particularly vulnerable, those who have not been convicted of a crime against another person and those who have served at least half of their sentences, department officials said. About 100 inmates were identified. “Given what we now know about the disease and its pervasiveness in our communities, it is appropriate to release individuals who face significant health challenges should they contract COVID-19,” said Brown, a Democrat. Studies show distancing is a challenge in prisons and jails because people live in close quarters. A 2018 study also showed Oregon has an aging prison population and houses the highest percentage of inmates over age 55 in the country.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in his dispute with legislative Republicans who are trying to end pandemic restrictions he imposed in March to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with a few Democrats in support, voted this week to end the state’s emergency disaster declaration that Wolf has used to shut down “nonlife-sustaining” businesses, ban large gatherings and order people to stay at home. Wolf asked the state’s high court to uphold the shutdown. He said that his gradual reopening plan is working, pointing to a downward trend in the number of new virus infections in Pennsylvania even as cases rise in nearly half the states. “Pennsylvania’s measured, phased process to reopen is successful because of its cautious approach that includes factors relying on science, the advice of health experts and that asks everyone to do something as simple as wearing a mask when inside or around others outside the home,” Wolf said in a news release. “We will continue to move forward cautiously.” Wolf has been easing restrictions in vast swaths of the state, including on Friday when he announced that another eight counties would be moving to the least restrictive “green” phase of his reopening plan. But gyms, barber shops, theaters and similar businesses in the state’s highly populated southeast corner remain closed, and many types of businesses statewide must abide by occupancy limits.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 2% of Rhode Island residents have been infected with the new coronavirus, with infection rates apparently higher among the state’s minority populations, according to a state Department of Health study. The numbers aligned with prior department data that found that people of color in the state have been disproportionately affected by the disease, Dr. Philip Chan, an infectious disease consultant at the department said during a remote news conference Friday. The state provided blood tests to 1,032 volunteers to see if they had signs of a past infection. Overall, 2.2% had antibodies, which the body produces to fight an infection. The rates appeared higher in blacks and Latinos/Hispanics, but the numbers of people tested in those groups was small. The numbers were unexpectedly low, but Chan credited that to the state’s “robust response” to the pandemic. The state randomly selected 5,000 households to get the test at one of several Stop & Shop supermarket locations. More than one person from some households received a test, conducted last month. The numbers can be used by the state to better direct resources to where they are needed most, Chan said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Bowling alleys can now reopen in South Carolina after being closed for nearly three months to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections, even though the state’s COVID-19 case load is seeing its largest increases since the pandemic began. Gov. Henry McMaster issued a seventh state of emergency declaration Thursday, lifting any virus-related restrictions on the number of people inside stores and opening bowling alleys. The guidelines suggest that operators ask bowlers to bring their own balls and shoes, use only every other lane to maintain social distancing, make hand sanitizer available and put disinfectant on surfaces bowlers could touch. The additional relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions comes even though the virus continues to spread in South Carolina, which set another state record Friday with 770 new COVID-19 infections reported. McMaster has said the onus of stopping the spread is now on individuals who should wear masks, practice social distancing and wash hands. He said the state can’t shut down businesses and require people to stay home again. The governor can only issue a state of emergency for 15-day increments. Some members of the General Assembly have said the law requires the governor to consult them after each increment, but McMaster said he doesn’t have to do that because each declaration is distinct and different.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The City Council is deciding whether to leave business restrictions becauser of the coronavirus pandemic in place for another month or leave the option open to business owners. The council passed emergency restrictions at the end of April that required restaurants, bars and other businesses serving customers to engage in certain practices meant to slow the spread of the virus. That includes cutting capacity in half, configuring tables to meet social distancing guidelines and requiring face masks for food service workers. The council was scheduled to discuss the options Monday, the Rapid City Journal reported. If extended, the restrictions would stay in place until July 10. Meanwhile, state health department officials reported Saturday that a woman in her 50s from Pennington County was the 75th person in the state to die from the virus. It is the eighth COVID-19 death in the county, which includes Rapid City.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Nashville Symphony board of directors decided Friday to suspend programs until August 2021 and furlough its music director and other full-time staff and dozens of musicians because of the coronavirus pandemic. The symphony has had to cancel or reschedule more than 65 concerts and events since March and projects losses from the pandemic to reach $8 million, nearly 30% of its annual income, it said in a news release. The board voted to furlough 79 musicians and 49 full-time staff members, including Music Director Giancarlo Guerrero, effective July 1.“First and foremost, we are dedicated to ensuring the safety and well-being of our patrons, along with our musicians, staff and volunteers, board Chairman Mark Peacock said in the release. “That means doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With operational costs totaling $2.3 million every month, we also face an enormous financial risk because of the continuing uncertainty caused by this pandemic.” Nashville Musicians Association President Dave Pomeroy said the local wants to help work out details of the orchestra’s safe return when the time comes.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:Protests against the killing of George Floyd were held in the city on May 31, June 3, June 10 and June 11. Protests in support of El Paso police officers were also held June 10. The local health authority recommends participants in those protests monitor their health closely. “I would recommend that those people that participated in the marches get tested between five to seven days after exposure if they are asymptomatic (without symptoms),” said City/County Health Authority Dr. Hector Ocaranza said in a statement. Testing should come sooner if a person develops symptoms for the virus, he said. Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough and loss of taste and smell. Those who develop symptoms “should be tested as soon as possible because there is community spread so someone might have contracted the virus somewhere else before the marches and maybe started experiencing symptoms one or two days after the march,” Ocaranza said. “You must always listen to your body.” Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to work with cities where there have been large-scale protests to expand testing at walk-up and drive-thru sites.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Bicycling has become a major hit for St. George in the era of COVID-19, but it could extend far beyond pandemic times and become commonplace activity for residents in the future. “There are some big projects coming in the next few years that will huge for connectivity and will make it all the more accessible for people to solely ride bikes if they want to,” said Dannielle Larkin, a member of the city council. “Or just have it be an addition to their travel if they want to have a car and bike, it just gives options and is a great healthy alternative.” St. George has long been a destination for people who like to spend time outdoors. But with the introduction of COVID-19 on American shores earlier this year, it became clear that being outside and around others would become increasingly rare. So the people of St. George started hitting the streets with their bikes instead. “Bikes are the new toilet paper and it’s super awesome,” Red Rock Cycling Co. employee Logan Toomer said. “People are getting out and being active and it’s great to see.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott expressed disappointment at the scale of the Legislature’s coronavirus-related economic recovery package as well as the pace at which lawmakers have moved on it. Three weeks ago, the Republican governor proposed a $400 million package of federal funds, including $310 million for small businesses, agriculture, housing and consumers. “We were inclusive in this work in hopes that it would move through the Legislature quickly and largely intact. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that it’s going to be the case as they’re only including about a third of the money we recommended,” he said. Instead, the Vermont House on Friday passed a package that would use just $93 million in federal funds allocated for the coronavirus response. It includes $50 million in emergency economic recovery grants to businesses, $20 million in grants to be distributed by local, regional, and state economic development organizations, and $23 million for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for grants to nonprofit housing partners, service organizations and for shelter facilities. The Legislature said other relief packages using the federal funds will follow. The Legislature did not use Scott’s plan because lawmakers found that some of the administration’s proposed uses for the funds were not authorized, and any loans made with the funds had to be paid back to the federal government by the end of December, a timeline that wouldn’t work for many businesses that did not want to take on more debt, House Speaker Mitzi Johnson’s office said.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A medical supply company created by two political consultants during the coronavirus pandemic have filed a lawsuit alleging that officials at a Virginia bank caused the firm to lose a $600 million equipment order and ruined its reputation. The Washington Post reported that in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Alexandria on Friday, Blue Flame Medical LLC alleged that officers of Chain Bridge Bank improperly told California officials that the company might be “fraudulent,” prompting the state to suspend its contract with Blue Flame and demand return of a $450 million down payment. State and local officials across the country ran into a confusing international market as they sought to secure personal protective equipment this spring. The lawsuit alleges that the Republican consultants who founded Blue Flame – John Thomas and Michael Gula – suffered damage to their personal reputations as a result of the bank’s actions. Chain Bridge Bank rejected the claims. The bank “acted properly and fulfilled its legal and regulatory responsibilities,” spokesman Rich Danker said. Ethan Bearman, Blue Flame’s general counsel, said the lawsuit was the beginning of a process “of setting the record straight” about Blue Flame. He said the company “has persevered and completed deliveries to satisfied customers.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Washington Department of Health said coronavirus infections are on the increase in the eastern and western sides of the state. The situation report said state epidemiologists have seen a particularly large increases in Benton, Yakima, Spokane and Franklin counties, but said the latest data through the end of May indicates likely increases in infections across the state. The results, the report said, included increases in coronavirus transmission over Memorial Day weekend, but not infections that might have occurred during recent protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people together in cities and towns across the state. The Seattle Times reported that Gov. Jay Inslee warned that the report indicates that “cases and deaths will soon increase substantially if COVID-19 continues to spread at the current levels.” Inslee said outbreaks in Benton, Franklin and Yakima counties are of “particular concern” and said he joined scientists and health and political leaders in those communities during a conference Saturday. The DOH report stated that six Washington counties – Yakima, Klickitat, Benton, Franklin, Spokane and Stevens – have not yet reached their peak number of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A coronavirus outbreak at a church has caused at least 17 virus cases, prompting Gov. Jim Justice to call in the National Guard for decontamination work, state officials said Saturday. The Greenbrier County church has closed for 14 days, and health officials started contact tracing to try to contain the virus’s spread, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. It’s the most recent of five confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks at churches in West Virginia, officials said. “I want to strongly encourage all West Virginians, especially when in church settings, to follow the guidelines and use every other pew, maintain social distancing and please wear masks,” Justice said in a release. “A lot of the attendance at our churches are those that are elderly and at higher risk, so we are cautioning everyone to strictly follow our guidelines.” The governor warned that things “will only get rougher” if people don’t follow health guidelines until a vaccine becomes available. Justice ordered the National Guard to go immediately to the site to begin decontamination, the state said. The governor also directed officials to hold two additional free testing events in Greenbrier County. The other counties where coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in churches are Boone, Hampshire, Jefferson, and Marshall counties, state officials said. To protect the possibility of identifying people, they said, the churches will not be named by the health and human resources department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:University of Wisconsin System officials are offering campuses guidelines for reopening this fall amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the system released the guidelines Sunday. They include putting classes of more than 50 students online, having a plan if COVID-19 cases spike, reevaluating dorm and dining operations, using masks and keeping students that share classes together in the dorms. Rob Cramer, system vice president for administration, said the recommendations are broad so individual chancellors can decide how to handle reopening. Some UW schools said dorms will be open and be allowed to fill to capacity. Schools also are creating isolation areas where sick students would be quarantined but could still access their courses online and have food delivered to them. Mask requirements will vary from campus to campus. UW-Platteville Chancellor Dennis Shields told the Journal Sentinel that students who won’t wear masks might not be allowed to attend his university. UW-Madison has yet to announce any reopening plans. A UW-Madison spokesman told the Journal Sentinel that school might release something by next week.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Legislature will not be meeting in a special session later this month after lawmakers said they completed work they needed to accomplish in response to immediate economic and social impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker Steve Harshman and Senate President Drew Perkins said in a joint letter that an anticipated five-day special session expected in late June is no longer necessary, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. “We are confident the Governor will implement our legislative directives addressing the needs of the State without the Legislature meeting in the near term,” the letter said. The announcement came after several committees were working on proposals to address the impacts of COVID-19. The decision was made in part because of the lack of federal action, Harshman said, adding that another special session could be held either later this summer or in the fall depending on the state’s needs. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2014/08/15/vestal-marching-band/14052645/", "title": "Striking up the band", "text": "Sara Tracey, and Jeff Platsky\n\nBinghamton\n\nThey've yet to take a single step or play a single note, to don the black hats or slide on the crisp, white gloves. Their first performance before a real crowd is weeks away, and the pressures of competitions to come are but a glimmer of excitement on the horizon.\n\nAll that comes later. First, there's this: Seventeen of the newest members of the Vestal Marching Band, eyes fixed on a screen in the high school auditorium, watching a study in near perfection.\n\nThe students — the youngest among them just 12 years old — are settled into twin rows of seats. The flickering film illuminates their faces in the gloom. On the screen, more than 150 members of the Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps move as one seamless black, purple and teal machine.\n\nThe performance is from this year's Drum Corps International World Championship Finals in Indianapolis. The Vestal students take in the fluidity and crispness of the formations. The color guard members spin their flags with precision. The trumpets blare in perfect counterpoint to the staccato of the drums.\n\nSome of these performers are the same age as the members of Vestal's rookie squad, who will spend the next two-plus months aspiring to such a performance. Along with their more seasoned fellow band members, they'll vie Oct. 26 for a winning place among the state's finest marching bands.\n\nTwelve minutes later, band director Greg Harris pauses the video. Four beats of silence, then five. Finally, from the audience of rookies, a single hushed word breaks the quiet.\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\nBuilding momentum\n\nThe goal of the video shown on Tuesday, the first day of rookie band camp, is to inspire, not to intimidate, Vestal's new marching band members. That's also the goal of rookie camp in general: 7.5 hours spread over three days designed to acclimate participants to the basics of the band. Next week, they'll be joined by the veterans as they start two weeks of intense band camp sessions.\n\n\"This is an unattainable goal,\" Harris tells the group after the video ends. \"We will not look like this. We will not sound like this. But this is the goal, always.\"\n\nRookie camp is the first step. It's a chance for the students, who are in seventh through 12th grades, to get to know each other as well as the team of band leaders and more seasoned students who serve as guides for other members of the band.\n\nPractical lessons abound, as well: They'll learn basic steps, how to wear and store their uniforms, how to hold their instruments and more.\n\nFor the band's director, the rookie camp is an early barometer of the path his students will take from here to the state competition.\n\nThis is the second year that Harris — an affable 29-year-old who lives in Candor with his wife and newborn son — has overseen the marching band. He's hoping a little consistency will make a big difference in the band's success; there have been four or five different directors at the band's helm in nearly as many years, he said.\n\nMore time has passed than that since the band has truly sparkled at the state competition. Each year for the past decade, the band has placed in the bottom half of its division in the New York State Field Band Conference Championship, which draws some 53 competitive marching bands from schools around the state. For the past several years, Vestal has competed in the Small Schools 3 Division, which includes a dozen bands this year.\n\nVestal was a founding member of that conference back in 1972, making it part of a local marching legacy. This year, Harris hopes, will add some much-needed shine to that legacy.\n\nThey've got the team: a strong group of adult and student leaders who handle everything from visuals and music to color guard and the various types of instruments. They've got the numbers: This year, the band nearly doubled in size, from 27 students to 49 at last count.\n\nAnd they've got the momentum: \"Last year was a transition year; this will be a lot easier to get started,\" Harris said. \"This year, I'm just excited to go. We can hit the ground running now.\"\n\nFirst steps\n\nNinety minutes after the rookies watch their video, 13-year-old Mukundan Murali, of Vestal, takes his first proper marching band step — and stumbles.\n\nHe wobbles while trying to balance on the left heel and right toe of his soccer cleats, surrounded by fellow band members all trying to master the same basic stance. He hold the pose for as long as he can, then teeters to the right. With a nervous smile, he rights himself.\n\nThe problem, he quickly realizes, are the cleats. While most of the students are clad in sneakers, Mukundan has just come from his final practice with the Greater Binghamton Footskills soccer academy. He's still wearing his uniform of knee-high, midnight blue socks and his goldenrod jersey, reflecting off the brass of the alto saxophone hanging around his neck.\n\nSoon, he'll trade the soccer clothes for the heavy, wool marching band ensemble. The cleats will be swapped for sleek, black Dinkles marching shoes that must be worn with black socks. The sax, of course, stays.\n\nOn this rainy Tuesday, the group has gathered to practice in the auditorium, though nicer weather later in the week will allow them space to stretch outdoors in the school's parking lot.\n\nThe rain reprieve will be short-lived. There's a reason Harris asked his musicians to tuck the six movements of music they'll be performing this season into plastic sheet protectors: Once the season starts, the only weather they won't perform in is thunder and lightning.\n\n\"I don't want to scare them, not yet,\" he says before the first day of rookie camp starts.\n\nThat season includes performances at some home games as well as five competitions standing between them and the state contest. Harris will use each as learning opportunities, chances to get better, to become the best.\n\nThe band will perfect a performance that has an international flair; they're calling it \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" But this is an 80-day journey for the band members as well: exactly 80 days from the band's first full music run-through, held at the beginning of August, to its state competition Oct. 26 in Syracuse University's Carrier Dome.\n\nBefore that, however, comes the very first steps — literally. These rookies must learn to march: left foot — always the left foot — in front of the right.\n\n\"You just took your first step, and that's the first step,\" Joshua Jenkins, the band's visual coordinator, tells the group. \"But we've got to work on it.\"\n\nNow, the process begins again: Jenkins commands the band to come to attention as music director Dan Miller taps out a rhythm on the blue gock — named for the sharp, echoing sound the block makes — to keep time.\n\nPrecision and uniformity are cornerstone skills for a marching band. Competition scores penalize bands when members fall out of step.\n\n\"There's no faster way to learn responsibility (than) when there's 60 other people relying on you to do something in a certain time in a certain way,\" Harris says.\n\nHe's seen the way that group reliance can forge close-knit ties. Relationships spring up. Some students start off as nervous newbies, unsure of how to navigate the high school hallways or the way to wear their uniform. As the season stretches on, after the hours of rehearsals and the bus rides and the performances, friendships will persist long after the music dies down, Harris says.\n\nFor Dan O'Brien, a 14-year-old eighth-grader and a new trombone player for the band, the Vestal Marching Band is a team no different than the high school's football squad.\n\n\"The work that we're doing ... this is a sport of its own,\" Dan says at the close of the first day of camp.\n\nPlotting the course\n\nAt the end of Tuesday's rehearsal, Harris reviews the day with fellow leaders Jenkins and Miller. They're pleased — some of the rookies looked like veterans even on their first day. Others need more time, but it's nothing that can't be worked on before band camp ends and regular after-school rehearsals begin.\n\nThere are typical complications: One rookie missed opening day, and another will be absent for the entire beginners' camp.\n\nHarris sits alone at his desk in the office next door to the band room and scans the roster for next week's full band camp, which begins Monday. He sighs when he realizes two dropouts will push the total number to just below 50.\n\nHarris turns his attention to plans for the next day's camp. By the end of the week, the rookies will need to be able to blend in with their more experienced bandmates. Mostly, that means marching: forward, backward, keeping time.\n\nOn Tuesday, they started with a single step. On Wednesday, Harris hopes, they'll begin stepping forward. Over the course of the next two months, the band will march for miles.\n\nIt's a long road to the state championships.\n\nThis year, the New York State Field Band Conference will have one of its largest pools of competitive marching bands since it began in the 1970s.\n\nThroughout the years, however, fewer and fewer Broome County bands have participated.\n\nVestal and Norwich schools were among the six charter members that started the conference in February 1972. The organization created a standardized set of competition rules and added judges to provide feedback to the different groups.\n\nParticipation from state marching bands has grown since the first championship performance in 1974 brought together 11 bands. This year, 52 bands will march in Syracuse University's Carrier Dome on Oct. 26.\n\nSeveral Broome County school marching bands have been featured in the conference's fall competitions, but some have not stayed on as participants through the years. Three area districts that once, but no longer, had competitive bands in the conference include Chenango Valley, Susquehanna Valley and Binghamton.\n\nToday, Union-Endicott, Johnson City and Vestal are still active in the conference.\n\nConference historian Jon Armstrong gave several reasons why bands could dissolve in a school district. Students now have more and more clubs and priorities vying for their attention. Different band directors could change their minds about their band marching competitively.\n\nAccording to the New York State Education Department's Office of Information and Reporting Services, participation in senior high marching bands by both students performing and teachers has dropped nearly 50 percent in about the last 40 years.\n\nIn the 1975-76 school year, the year after the first New York State Field Band Conference Competition, there were nearly 21,000 students in a senior high school marching band, with 261 teachers involved. Fast forward to the 2011-12 school year, and the number of students drops to about 11,000 with only 140 teachers.\n\nSome school marching bands still exist, but in much smaller form. For example, the Vestal Marching Band once competed in the largest classification of schools, with upwards of 170 band members, Armstrong said. This year, they have 49 — and that's nearly double from last year.\n\nDan Miller remembers playing in Union-Endicott's marching band in its heyday in the 1980s, boasting nearly 200 members. Now, as the music director for the Vestal band, he said he wants students to still feel the same excitement as he did years ago.\n\n\"We reached a low point of enrollment, but I'm proud seeing that we're growing,\" he said.\n\nThere are no school bells luring some students into the band room of Vestal High School early Monday, more than three weeks before the first day of classes.\n\nIt's the start of band camp season, with only 69 days left in the Vestal Marching Band's 80-day journey to Syracuse's Carrier Dome and the New York State Field Band Conference Championships. Even before then, they'll be performing in front of supporting fans — their parents — in about two weeks for their first full show run-through.\n\nStudents start filing in to the band room by 7:45 a.m., toting instrument cases and gurgling half-gallon water jugs. There's no need for band director Greg Harris to tell the group what to do: The schedule that will change every morning of the two-week camp is on the white board.\n\nThrough the sleepy haze that will eventually rise with the sun, there's a buzzing energy. The band is bigger, the music is exciting. It's time to go.\n\nMolly Merges walks into room 114 for her last first day of band camp. The senior has been made section leader of the guard, leading a group of six other girls spinning flags and adding a dance quality to the music-heavy group.\n\nShe's come prepared. A new color guard saber and rifle, the latter wrapped in a fresh coat of white vinyl tape. Though she hasn't spun a flag in a group since winter guard ended on March 4, she's practiced as often as she could in her Vestal front yard this summer, readying for her last camp. She bears the scars of her work, literally: A healed cut with a still-forming bruise decorates her left calf, thanks to her new saber. The summer, she says, will be full of marks like that from collisions with props.\n\n\"It already smells like sunscreen,\" she says to a fellow guard girl, gathering her equipment for section rehearsals.\n\nSunscreen, sneakers and gallons of ice water are small comforts in the intensive two-week band camp. The students, some of them as young as 12, are on their feet for most of the 6- to 8-1/2-hour days, four times a week. These two weeks — uninterrupted by other commitments like school work and extracurricular activities — will be the most concentrated span of time the band can ready itself for competition season. Pouring rain won't hurt, especially if drill charts and music are protected in a binder like they're supposed to be. Sunscreen prevents most of a blazing August sun's damage, though most will walk away with tan lines from sneakers and sunglasses. Water breaks are awarded often, if not for brief durations.\n\nAcross the room, in the muted reflection from a closet door window, Brianna Cordi applies a healthy dose of sun protection to her face. It's only supposed to be 64 degrees in the morning, but she doesn't want to take the chance with her fair, freckled skin.\n\nShe's not thinking about this year's camp, but the next one. The 15-year-old Vestal resident is the junior drum major and spent four days of her summer at Drum Major Academy at West Chester University near Philadelphia. Her dad told her to look at what the college could offer for her future. Instead, she took away the skills she would need next year when she will be promoted to conduct the entire band in another set of music, other drills with different members.\n\nMusicians, guard and staff have finally come together for the first week of band camp. The eight days of camp acclimates both the band veterans and the rookies — who got their crash course last week — to this year's show.\n\nNew staff members have been added to the roster, each with their own specialties. The veterans are building from last year's experience; the rookies from last week. Band camp assesses what skills are there, what needs to be drilled further and what needs to change completely.\n\nWork with what you have\n\nIt's during band camp that a semblance of the show is put together, piecemeal if need be.\n\nAt this point, musicians have had their music since the end of July. Harris would love if everyone had memorized it by band camp, but he knows it won't always happen that way. Time is set aside for rehearsals for each of the band's four sections: woodwinds, brass, percussion and guard.\n\nWhen the 47 band students get together during rehearsals, most of the student performers transform into dots. Each marker on the drill charts shows the position where a band member must be to create the pretty designs and pictures viewers in the stands can see from above.\n\nThree days into band camp, and they have only half of the six drill charts they need for a full show. Because an outside party is creating the Vestal drills for them, Harris isn't surprised that the whole show isn't completed by band camp. As long as the band can get through all six movements by the end of Thursday, he's confident everything will fit together eventually.\n\n\"It's not bad; we'll get there\" seems to be a mantra for Harris and the rest of his staff. All of them have worked with marching bands before, either directing or performing in them.A polished show won't fully emerge until halfway through marching band season, they agree. By the end of September, volunteers will have built show props, and the band will have had plenty of time to fine tune and memorize all six movements of their show.\n\nGive them until the end of September, the staff assures. Maybe before — these kids are fast learners.\n\nOn the second day of camp, the band runs through the drill of the first movement, stepping to the beat of the song that will give their show wings: John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" From there, the music is meant to transport. Some songs, from Latin America, Korea and Africa, harken to foreign lands. Others are more literal to the practice of traveling: \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" by the Dropkick Murphys, and Ozzy Osbourne's \"Mama, I'm Coming Home.\"\n\nVisual coordinator Josh Jenkins scrutinizes the John Denver drill at the top of the 25 rows of bleachers facing the field.\n\nAfter the band's run-through of the first movement drills, black rubber pellets that cushion Dick Hoover Stadium's artificial turf are scattered about. A student calls to Harris near the back of the pack. She has a friend who plays tuba and would love to be in the marching band. Vestal's tuba — or the more marching-appropriate sousaphone — section was whittled last week from two players to a solo student.\n\nTrouble is, this friend goes to another school district.\n\n\"How soon can she move here?\" Harris asks, jokingly but with a hint of need in his voice. Other staff members pick up on the joke, knowing in the back of their minds that another sousaphone would help create the round, full sound they crave for the brass section this year.\n\nEven though the size of the band has increased significantly since last year's 27 members, there are always needs that can't be filled. Since the middle of the summer, five band members already dropped out. Harris is optimistic that will change once the school year begins and some students want an extracurricular activity to fill their time or college applications.\n\nBeyond the band\n\nBand camp is more than just about the musicians. The staff and various volunteers wait on the sidelines or aren't seen at all, conducting crucial work as the first performance draws near.\n\nA floor below the band room, rookies and veterans file in during camp sessions, getting pinned, tucked and otherwise fitted into their uniforms. Each outfit has up to seven pieces, and growing adolescents often don't fit last year's uniform.\n\nChristina Flores-Meyers kneels in front of one rookie trying on the overall-like black wool pants for the first time. They ride up a little too much, showing ankle that no one else is the band will be exposing. The Vestal band mom tugs on the bottom of the pants.\n\n\"I'm Christina, by the way,\" introducing herself to the girl she's kneeling in front of.\n\nIt's a practice Beth Wilton has done for years: Keeping the 17-year-old uniforms in condition for dozens of band members to wear. There's nothing a few pins or replacement buttons can't fix. It would cost about $350 to replace a single uniform for the band, she said, and there's no budget for that.\n\nOld isn't necessarily bad, as long as it fits the purpose. Zach Aiosa plays with a decades-old trombone his grandfather gave him. The bell is a different shade of brass than the rest of the horn. It's dinged and scratched. But staff members don't pay attention to the look of his instrument: They just compliment Zach on how he holds the horn at just the right angle.\n\nThe marching band does not have a budget. Before the start of each competition season, the band staff must assess what equipment has to be replaced or purchased for the year's show. Band boosters find out what the needs are, and depending on how much money is left from last year's fundraising, they can buy the mallets the percussion coordinator requested, or they can go without.\n\n\"It seems like we're doing fundraising every day,\" Harris says, glancing up from his Mac laptop, layered with multiple pages of various marching band equipment from online vendors.\n\nThe band lucked out this season: There's enough money to purchase the $2,000-plus equipment and music fees this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the biggest necessity is the copyrights to four of the six pieces of arranged music the marching band is performing in its \"Around the World: An 80 Day Journey\" show.\n\nHarris needs proof that he purchased $1,131 worth of copyright permission from two sheet music companies by Sunday. If he doesn't have the proof, they don't get to perform the music. No music, no show.\n\nAlone in his office on Wednesday, Harris struggles to find a phone number for customer service for each company. The credit card information the Band Aides gave him isn't going through, and he just wants to talk to a real person.\n\nA speaker in the adjacent band room thocks out a digital metronome to keep the pit orchestra in time as they rehearse in their section. Out in the high school parking lot, the rest of the band is trying to figure out the drill to movement two. Harris needs to be in several places at once.\n\nHe makes his choice: Leaving voice mails for each company, he throws on a faded gray Syracuse University baseball cap and grabs his green drill sheet binder. He needs to find out how the show is progressing.\n\nDressed in an aquamarine polo, brown cargo shorts and Nikes, Harris looks like some of the high school students he teaches. His short black hair is gelled and slightly flipped at the top of his forehead.\n\nThe director of the Vestal Marching Band usually speaks to his student performers from the ground — in the high school parking lot where they practice — but today this is different.\n\nThis is the parent performance, the first time the 49-member-strong band will perform in uniform in front of an audience. Parents, siblings and friends waved away flies in the muggy heat last Tuesday at dusk on the sideline of Sommer's Field behind the old Clayton Avenue Elementary School. Some sat in lawn chairs, most stood.\n\nHarris rushed up seven silver rungs to tower 12 feet above the crowd on a platform, usually a spot where the drum major conducts the band during a performance.\n\nToday, Harris isn't conducting musicians. His direction is aimed at the audience.\n\nThis group of special spectators will put on a show of their own, a performance in a performance. As the band plays six songs in eight minutes, he watches. At strategic points in the music, he claps. Loudly. So the parents get the hint and clap along.\n\nIf the parents clap at these places during the band's competitions, like the first one in Baldwinsville on Sept. 13, at the end of movements or after particularly impressive musical feats, others will follow their lead. Like the laugh at the end of a joke, it will signify that the band has done their job.\n\n\"We're more ready than anything this year, and you should be proud of your students,\" he tells the crowd of about 100.\n\nSaxophonist Brianna Cordi opens the show with a solo introducing \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" Mike Slilaty joins on clarinet, making it a duet. After the 16 measures of harmony, a beat of silence.\n\nHarris knows the rest of the band will join in at that moment. But the audience doesn't. He claps. Parents compound the applause, momentarily drowning out the entire band's entrance.\n\nFamilies are there to enjoy the result of their students' hard work over the three weeks of band camp before school starts. Harris has more on his mind. He makes mental notes\n\nThis is the second year the 29-year-old has directed the Vestal Marching Band. In a year, the band swelled from 27 members to nearly 50. This year, he said, the band is more prepared for competition season — leading to the New York State Field Band Conference Championship on Oct. 26 — than he ever expected. The students have memorized their music ahead of schedule. Most of the drill, or the marching sequence, is learned too.\n\nAt this point last year, the band wasn't ready to perform the whole show. During its first competition, exactly a year ago today, the band only marched half of the show. The second half of the 9-minute show was played standing still.\n\nThis group could compete tomorrow.\n\nWould they get a perfect score? Probably not, Harris said. But they are putting in the necessary effort.\n\nHarris will be the first one to say he's a perfectionist. You'll never hear him say, \"That was awesome\" to his band during rehearsals. A note could have been held longer. A crescendo could have been smoother. A stop in the music could have been cleaner.\n\nHarris grew up in Hamburg, just outside of Buffalo. He is the younger of two sons of a volunteer firefighter father who works at a beverage distribution company and mother who was a former teacher. As younger siblings often do, he got his start in music following his brother Kirk, five years his senior.\n\nAs a four-year-old, Harris joined his brother and sang in the choir at the St. James United Church of Christ. When Harris started playing the piano, he said he may have been influenced when he and his mother Jan would pick Kirk up from his own piano lessons. Kirk played trumpet in school; Harris followed when he entered fourth grade. Kirk, now a psychologist in Chicago, is still involved in music: Harris said he's an on-call doctor for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n\nWhen Harris started surpassing his brother and classmates in the Frontier Central School District's music programs he began to consider music as a career. In eighth grade, he successfully auditioned for a spot in a select high school band.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh, I'm pretty good at this.' It's nice to know what you want to do with the rest of your life when you're in high school,\" he said.\n\nFrom then on, Harris solicited the talents of others to play better. He spent the money he earned as a dishwasher and line cook to pay $40 to $50 per lesson. One instructor, a trumpeter who toured with Johnny Carson bandleader Doc Severinsen and gave lessons whenever he was home in Hamburg, spent an entire hour-long lesson making Harris play the same eight measures of music over and over. Anytime a note was missed, or a quarter note was held a beat too long, Harris had to start over.\n\n\"It was the hardest lesson of my life,\" he said. \"He proved his point which was every part of the note is important.\"\n\nThat trumpet lesson taught him that details do matter — both as you move from note to note in music as well as in life.\n\nBefore marching band competition, Harris scrutinizes each band member's ensemble. Do you have the right pins on your jacket collar? The Vestal \"V\" and a single gold bar for each year you've been in the band must be there. No? Go see a uniform parent and get it right. If there's anything but black socks in your black Dinkles, a brand of marching shoes, get another pair.\n\n\"I had a kid try to get by with white socks. It doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nEven though competitions haven't started, his band members get the message. A similar uniform check before Tuesday's parent performance revealed an eighth grader with no socks.\n\n\"It's the one thing you need!\" an exasperated bandmate chides him.\n\nOnce the uniforms are checked and the band goes through one last run through of music before marching onto turf fields from Baldwinsville, Corning, West Genesee or Syracuse, Harris has no more control.\n\nHe said he gets his music directing ideas from the late John Wooden, whose books sit on Harris' shelf at home. The 40-year basketball coach for UCLA would drill his team in practices, but remain quiet on the bench during games. Harris can only sit in the stands, watching the band he created since August.\n\n\"The kids are nervous for the performances, but I am way more nervous. I don't show it. There's nothing I can do at that point. It's all up to them. They'll do what they'll do. I've done everything I can to prepare them.\"\n\nAt a 2001 TED Talk, Wooden explained to the audience what he would tell his players: \"Just get out there, and whatever you're doing, do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that.\"\n\nHarris uses that kind of strategy with his band. He corralled the members of his band before giving them a half hour to change into their black, white and green uniforms. He didn't have a whiteboard marking defensive strategies like a basketball coach, just the drill charts in his well-used forest green binder. He even gives a pre-game speech — the words are never planned, but Harris tells the kids what he thinks they need to hear to get them energized, get their heads in the game.\n\n\"You need to have confidence in every note you play, every step you take,\" he said. \"Just put all your effort into it.\"\n\nHarris hates to admit it, but his parents' advice is rubbing off.\n\nThey're the same lessons he learned when he was younger, the ones he finds himself doling to his students in any of the Vestal band programs: Be organized. Do it right the first time so you don't have to do it a second time.\n\nThat last one, he said, he learned the hard way, cutting wood to fuel the wood-burning stove in his family's Hamburg home. In August, in the same month and at the same age as some of the 49 students that go through band camp, he'd slice through logs with his older brother Kirk and his father.\n\nCut the logs. Stack them, right, along the 150-yard expanse of grass behind the house. Sweep up the sawdust. Mow the lawn. Repeat, if need be. If one step wasn't done correctly, Harris's dad made them do it again.\n\n\"That's why I'll never have a wood-burning stove,\" he said. But, he admits, he'll never get a gas stove. A flip of the switch, and you get what you need. It's too easy. He and his wife Katy, 28, currently heat their Willseyville, Tioga County, home in the winter with a black coal-fueled stove.\n\nYears later, in the parking lot of the Vestal High School, he puts his band through a similar exercise during its band camp. March the first movement. Stop. Confer with the staff. Change a step. Repeat, if need be.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, there will be a lot of repeating steps. School has started. Competition season is approaching. Seven weeks until Syracuse.\n\n***\n\nHarris is still hesitant about fatherhood.\n\nThe band students he's used to directing can be as young as 12. But when it comes to his own son, one-month-old Brennan, he's in new territory.\n\nHarris remembers changing Brennan's diaper for the first time. Well, not changing it: watching someone else do it.\n\nHe asked Katy in the first few days of August just after Brennan came home for the first time if he could watch her complete the task in the baby's room on the first floor of their Willseyville home. He never had younger cousins or siblings to take care of. He's the youngest in his family. Katy babysat young nephews. He asked for the same advice from her when he held Brennan for the first time. When he put Brennan in his crib. How do I do that? I don't want to hurt him? Can you do it first?\n\n\"I think he's more critical than he needs to be,\" Katy said.\n\nHe needed to learn. Like his high school lessons, he said he needs experience to learn.\n\nHarris himself never participated in a show band like the one he's directing now. Most of his personal experience was singing or playing on a stage, in a uniform of a black-and-white tuxedo for the Ithaca College Wind Ensemble, or black jackets and jeans for the Ithacappella all-male singing group. He directed the Erie County Fair Marching Band during his summers as an Ithaca College student, but they marched in parades.\n\nIn Vestal, he doesn't know how to execute the plie or cone spins that the seven-member color guard performs while the band opens the show with \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" That's why 24-year-old Heidi Conroy was brought in. Conroy performed in the Vestal color guard and winter guard as a high schooler herself.\n\nSome days in band camp, when a student was absent while going through the movements, Harris placed himself on their \"dots\" and followed Ithaca College sophomore and visual captain Josh Jenkin's instructions. He took the place of bass clarinet player Brianna Hawkins or Josh Lewis on baritone saxophone, filling in the spots of absent band members. While he wouldn't play an instrument, he marched, learning the drills one step, one rotation at a time.\n\nHe did forget sunscreen, a rule he drills into the students' heads. He has a band tan he jokes Brennan didn't inherit, like his eyes or Katy's nose.\n\nWith the new baby, there isn't much down time these days for Greg and Katy Harris, who is an athletic trainer for the Cornell University women's ice hockey team. When Brennan sleeps in his mechanized rocker they use the one-hour breaks to wash dishes and maybe shower. That's become optional with parenthood.\n\nThe couple keeps a Google calendar, meshing her hockey games with his performances. For the entire month of September, there are only two days that aren't marked with events. They land on weekdays — days Harris will be holed up in the music wing in Vestal anyway, directing one of the high school's five bands or after school with the marching band.\n\nThey keep their iPhones on at all times. Katy could get a call at 2 a.m. from a hockey player who dislocated a knee cap. Harris answers emails from parents who have their own jobs during the day and can only communicate at night.\n\nFree time is something the couple attempts to get, but don't often give themselves. They'll watch TV after work sometimes — one afternoon \"The Simpsons\" marathon plays on mute in the background. Usually in the summer, Harris and Katy take a month vacation to Hawaii where Katy's aunt and uncle live. This year was tough, though: Brennan was two weeks late and they couldn't travel more than an hour from the hospital.\n\nA lot of Harris's down time is in his electric blue SUV, driving the 40-minute commute each way from his job in Vestal. He never listens to music in the car. He downloads sports podcasts on his phone, \"The Dan Patrick Show.\" When he was a student at Ithaca College, he never spent time outside of classes or rehearsals in the Whalen Center for Music.\n\n\"I had to spend all my time with music people I would go crazy,\" he said. \"They talk about music all the time, I needed something else to do.\"\n\nHe tries to keep Sundays open, too, whenever possible. Even if he's up until 11 p.m. on Saturdays picking up after a competition or traveling on a bus home with the rest of the band, he'll be at a Buffalo Bills home game on Sunday with his father. Tailgating in the morning, sitting in the third tier, 21 rows up. It's something he's done since he was 11 years old.\n\nIf Brennan grows up and doesn't play sports, his parents said that's fine. If he doesn't play music, that's fine.\n\nHarris pauses. He considers what he's learned being a musician. Dedication. Passion. Friendship. The same lessons the kids in his marching band are learning right now, or at least what he hopes they're taking out of the experience.\n\n\"No, actually, that's not fine, he has to try.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, Sara Zuwiyya seems like your typical busy high school senior.\n\nThe 17-year-old Vestal High School student juggles classes with clubs, sports and volunteer work. Her life plays out in two calendars: Classwork is dictated in her school agenda and cross-country meets, engineering club meetings and other activities are tracked on her phone.\n\nBut Saturday evenings and at least twice a week after school, Zuwiyya commands the attention of fellow students as senior drum major of the Vestal Marching Band, serving as the main student leader in that group of nearly 50 high school and middle school instrumentalists.\n\nUsually, Friday nights are free of homework, but she recently gave herself a Friday assignment: Think of a salute, the first glimpse the audience will have of the marching band's six New York State Field Band Conference competitions.\n\nZuwiyya will stand taller than any other member in the band, aided by a 72-inch aluminum podium, dressed in an all-black uniform. She's the only band member who gets new, crisp white gloves before a show, colors contrasting to show off her conducting hands.\n\nTo her, working on the salute isn't homework. It's perfecting her role in a band she's participated in since middle school. This year, though, she's not playing on the field with other flutists. She's trying to make her mark as the highest-ranking senior in a band growing in size and stability.\n\nHer older brother, Joe, now 20, was on that same podium for three years as senior drum major. Zuwiyya wants to leave behind her own legacy now.\n\n\"I watched him, and learned from him but I want to show what I can do,\" she said.\n\nShe gets her chance the next day. Music director Dan Miller prompts a run-through of the entire show during a Saturday morning practice in the Vestal High School parking lot with the dictum familiar to Zuwiyya and most competitive bands:\n\n\"Performing their 2014 program, 'Around the World: An 80-day Journey,' the Vestal Marching Band, led by drum major Sara Zuwiyya. Drum major, is your band ready?\"\n\nZuwiyya straightens out her 5-foot-3-inch frame. The first 16 beats of the six-movement show are hers.\n\nTime to put Friday night's work on saluting to good use.\n\nShe turns her back to the 49-member-strong band to face the audience — imaginary in the parking lot. There will be people in the stands for the band's first competition of the season in Baldwinsville a few hours from that practice. There will be judges waiting to officiate the show.\n\nShe sharply strikes her first pose: Left hand pointed flat at her left hip, while the right hand is positioned at the corner of her eye, harkening back to the military roots of marching bands. But she interjects some fun: Tucked into the sleeve of her all-black uniform will be a paper airplane. Zuwiyya will toss it into the audience, hinting at the 8-minute travel-themed performance.\n\nThere's no place for paper airplanes during this rehearsal: Rain and 50-degree weather have made the practice miserable for a lot of the band members. Many would rather be sleeping right now.\n\nZuwiyya pushes the sleeves of her navy windbreaker up to her elbows. Rain soaks the bottom six inches of her brown corduroy pants. Wisps of her long brown hair stick to her forehead and neck, plastered by rain.\n\nShe's not thinking about being warm. She's more concerned about her band seeing her. Mostly her hands.\n\nIf the band can't see her hands, it's as if she's not conducting at all. If she's not conducting, she's not doing her job.\n\nThe senior drum major is the student with the most authority in the band, following the band director and staff members in the chain of command. When band staff sits in the stands during a show, a drum major takes the lead. She conducts the band through all its performances, takes attendance on the bus ride to each show and is expected to be a role model for all other band members.\n\nNext in line is the junior drum major — the \"vice president\" for the senior, says band director Greg Harris. This year, that title falls to 15-year-old junior Brianna Cordi, of Vestal. She will take Zuwiyya's place when the senior graduates. She practices Zuwiyya's salute, in case of emergency. If the senior drum major can't make a performance, Cordi is on deck.\n\nAfter Zuwiyya's salute, Cordi will pick up on her cue. She introduces the band in another way, playing the alto saxophone solo that leads in John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\"\n\nWith just five weeks until the New York State Field Band Conference Championships, Zuwiyya knows a little about what's coming for her last season with the band.\n\nThe announcers at each of the competitions will recognize, and mess up, her last name. When her brother was drum major she can't remember a time when they got the name right. (For the record, it's Zuh-wee-yah, with a slight emphasis on the second syllable.)\n\nShe also knows there will be a lot of juggling on top of conducting. Both of the drum majors, on top of multiple extracurriculars and academic requirements, are also athletes. Cordi plays softball and bowls, while Zuwiyya is on the Vestal cross-country team. There will be a Saturday when Zuwiyya has to run in a meet in Rochester and drive with her mom for 1.5 hours to make it to a marching band performance in Camillus.\n\nWhen Harris took command a director of the Vestal Marching Band last year, Zuwiyya was already slated to be the junior drum major, appointed by the band director that came before him. He was concerned about her cross-country running and band commitments within hours of each other.\n\n\"Can you manage all of this?\" he asked her at the end of last year. She assured him, yes. Harris hasn't been disappointed yet.\n\nWhen choosing drum majors, Harris has a whole application process. Candidates discuss their drum major aspirations through preliminary questions on paper: Name, instrument, why do you want to be drum major.\n\nZuwiyya and Cordi can answer that last one in a similar way: I want to see what I can accomplish.\n\nThen there's an interview process. Last year, Harris interviewed two individuals to fill the junior drum major spot. He wants individuals who will lead, not dictate. He expects the drum majors to assume responsibility for several tasks, conducting the group, setting up and striking the podium before and after practice.\n\nHe admits that leadership can be difficult, since the students in the band spend most of their days together in classes already. It's a balance between being liked and being respected.\n\n\"I never ask them to be in charge of the band,\" Harris said. \"They're supporting, not telling.\"\n\nHe knows drum majors will not start the marching band season knowing everything. Not many high school students have experience conducting and leading a group of their peers. Neither Zuwiyya nor Cordi have assumed a formal leadership role despite their multiple activities.\n\nup of their peers. Neither Zuwiyya nor Cordi have assumed a formal leadership role despite their multiple activities.\n\nThat's where Lauren Reynolds and her staff comes in.\n\nReynolds, the director of bands for Central Connecticut State University, is one of eight lead staff members for the George N. Parks Drum Major Academy. Several workshops are held during the summer to get band leadership from across the country in shape for their impending seasons. The 14-hour days were filled with lessons on conducting, marching techniques and leadership skills. The camp, Reynolds said, is less about teaching the technique, but teaching to teach.\n\nZuwiyya and Cordi both attended a version of the academy for four days this summer in West Chester University in Pennsylvania. This summer, they were two of about 300 drum majors from high schools and colleges from across the country.\n\n\"They are, by and large, the best of the best,\" said Reynolds, a 32-year-old Glastonbury, Conn. resident. \"You rarely encounter a lack of commitment with drum majors.\"\n\nCordi, for one, still carries around the pink notebook from the camp. In the first 20 pages or so, in pink pen, she's drawn conducting diagrams. She practices the movements at home in her free time, knowing that now her place is on the field, not the conducting podium occupied by Zuwiyya.\n\nCordi won't adopt the senior drum major status until she starts her last year of high school. Her first year of band, she was goaded into the program by a family friend. Even then, she knew the authority and responsibility that came with being in the top position.\n\n\"(The drum major) was perfection on a podium,\" she said. \"That's what I strive for — perfection.\"\n\nConducting, Zuwiyya admits, is her biggest shortcoming.\n\nShe's been musically inclined since the fourth grade, the first year she could join a music ensemble at a Vestal school. Tempo, crescendo and staccato are not foreign words to her. It's combining the technical aspects of music with the emotions of the show, she said.\n\n\"If someone is dancing with angry music on, it's different than when they're dancing with slower music,\" she said. \"I can do the style, and then I can conduct. It's hard to do both.\"\n\nSlowly but surely, Zuwiyya has made steps to be an accurate, expressive conductor: She moves to the music. The slower \"Arirang\" becomes a solo waltz. Faster tunes makes her bounce from one foot to the other.\n\nCordi remembers Zuwiyya's brother Joe on the drum major stand. \"He was crazy, dancing and jumping around all the time,\" she said.\n\nBefore the Baldwinsville show, Zuwiyya thinks about the speed of her own dance, the tempo at which she'll conduct Ozzy Ozbourne's faster \"Mama, I'm Coming Home,\" her favorite because of its speed and the picked-up energy the band adopts while playing it.\n\nShe second-guesses herself. Her moment of a pause causes half the band to start marching while the other half wait for their real cue.\n\nShe'll later convene with music director Miller on the podium, discussing the best way to give the band its rhythm. He will suggest to Zuwiyya to keep her hand movements crisp and sharp. A flowery hand gesture may look pretty, but it's harder for a band member 50 feet away to determine when Zuwiyya wants one note to end and another to begin.\n\n\"It's better to mess up now than at a competition,\" comforts Emily Goldenberg, a 16-year-old Vestal junior who can see the frustration on Zuwiyya's face. She and the rest of the pit percussion players are physically closest to the drum major during the performances, xylophones and marimbas just feet away from the conducting podium.\n\nZuwiyya doesn't want to make excuses. The goal she set for herself this season is \"lead by example.\" She doesn't want hesitation to be her legacy.\n\n\"It's better never than ever.\"\n\nTelevision producer, age 45.\n\nMedical records manager, 53.\n\nGrocery store employee, 43.\n\nCollege student, 18.\n\nFar-flung and on different paths, this diverse group is a handful from the hundreds who share a common past. All, with pride, call themselves alumni of the Vestal Marching Band.\n\nOn Oct. 11,the current band will host the Golden Circle of Bands competition, the only home show Vestal has before the Oct. 26 championship show. Alumni will be at Dick Hoover Field on Oct 11, selling green-and-gold band bling and reliving their marching days through the six performing bands.\n\nOthers will watch progress from afar, keeping up with the 453 bandies that compose the Vestal High School Marching Band Facebook page.\n\nTo many alumni, being in the band wasn't just another activity taking up space on a college application. Days of band camp, hours of after-school practices, the moments of clarity, the excitement of a season going well make up their memories of the band.\n\nAnd this season is going well for the Vestal band, which has increased its score by about three points each week, ranking the group higher and higher in its band division in the state.\n\nOut of all that, the alumni know from experience that this year's group of 50 students in the band will take away many intangibles.\n\n\"In everything I do, I'm working the hardest I can, striving to be as good as possible,\" said one alumna, Wendy Wilkins. \"Band taught me that.\"\n\nLife's lessons learned\n\nTucked away in Wilkins' bedroom closet in Los Angeles, 2,700 miles from her Vestal childhood home, is a broken memory. Broken, but still good.\n\nLike a threadbare baby blanket or stuffing-less teddy bear, 45-year-old Wilkins kept her trusty band prop for sentimental reasons. A member of the color guard, Wilkins won't give up her fake rifle, a band memory that goes back to 1983.\n\nThat wooden rifle was well-used by her until 11th grade, when she missed a throw at a band competition show. She has since repaired the split wood between the butt and barrel.\n\nAbout 30 years separate Wilkins from her formal rifle-spinning days. Vestal High School memories that shine brightest are the band bus trips, her friend, a color guard captain, who snagged the Homecoming Queen title, and the self-esteem that would swell inside her.\n\n\"Band was like telling the best joke at the party, and everyone laughing, and having that happen over and over again,\" Wilkins said in an interview from her California home. \"It was my own personal high.\"\n\nIn band, she said, no one in the 300-strong group made fun of her \"big butt\" like some students in the away-game crowds. She found her place, despite her \"sports hero\" father wishing she stuck to soccer, softball, anything other than the band. He came around after seeing her perform in the first home football game of her freshman year.\n\nBand is where she learned to work in a group, not compete for a higher score or faster time as she would when she swam for the high school.\n\nThat perspective also geared her to root for the underdog, which Los Angeles is full of, she assures. She's given rides to fresh arrivals to the big city, harkening to her days as a mentor with the Vestal Marching Band. If they look green, help.\n\nShe even sneaks in some of her band inspiration into her work: As a freelance television writer and director, she's worked on the sets of HBO's \"Deadwood\" and \"Six Feet Under.\" Whenever she can, Wilkins said she tries to inject color guard references into scripts. She just finished a book about being in band camp, called \"Mark Time Move.\"\n\nFrom performer to parent\n\nMark Merges doesn't need his old trumpet to remember his days in the Vestal Marching Band. He still has it, though.\n\nSitting in the high school's Room 114 — Vestal band headquarters — on a recent weeknight, he was one of about a dozen band parents hammering out the whens, wheres and hows of the upcoming Golden Circle competition. Parents in the Band Aides basically run the Saturday show.\n\nOn this evening, the parental discussion focused on where performers can change in and out of their uniforms. There's talk about using a Vestal school gymnasium, with the divider pulled across the center of the room. One side for girls, the other for boys.\n\nMerges, 53, of Vestal, tunes his sarcasm to the right pitch. Dry humor was a vital tactic in band, he said. It kept the bullies at bay and was a way to playfully haze any fresh-mouthed rookies. He kept the lighthearted cynicism — as he has with the horn — with him in life. It's a good counterpoint to his work as a health information manager at United Health Services.\n\n\"Why do they need a whole room? Isn't that what buses are for?\"\n\nWhen he was in the band, his changing room was on wheels. Often, Merges said the band was late in their rush to competitions, and had to change into their uniforms on the bus. It was a ritual that shocked his World War II veteran father who chaperoned one of these trips, blindsided when he saw teenagers undressing in front of him.\n\nBut Merges knew the work that went with band. When a director told you to stand at attention, you did it. Merges was in the marching band during its militaristic days from his time in the Africa Road Junior High Marching Band until he graduated from the high school in 1979.\n\nMerges' daughter, Molly, joined the band because of her dad's stories. Molly, 17, is this year's color guard section leader and in her final foray with the marching band.\n\nMark Merges has more than stories from his days in the Vestal Marching Band. Tucked away in a yellow folder — a price sticker dictating the folder's price of 16 cents when he bought it for a middle school science class — he has saved competition programs and old photographs of Jazz Band.\n\nShakos, chickens and instruments pinpoint Merges' friends in those aging pictures. In the high school were different cliques. The jocks, the cheerleaders and greasers. Merges just fit with the marching band kids.\n\n\"You just have a sense of purpose when you're in band,\" he said. \"You had your job, and everyone depends on you to do that.\"\n\nJust as he needs to coordinate volunteers this year on the day of the Golden Circle. He'll be armed with a walkie-talkie, moving volunteers around and solving any last-minute crises.\n\nDon't expect him to be free during Vestal's performance though. He'll be in the stands, watching his daughter's last home show.\n\nFrom performer to director\n\nTo Mark Dowches, marching band was one of the hardest things to experience.\n\nThe two-time band alumnus played mellophone with the marching band until 1989, preceded by two sisters. A dozen years later, one of his old music directors asked him to join the Vestal Marching Band staff. Two years before Greg Harris took the helm of the band, 43-year-old Dowches ended up directing the band.\n\nIn that time, he said the band was at its lowest membership, at 26 students in 2012. The year before, floods from Tropical Storm Lee ripped through the practice fields.\n\nBut the band rallied. Twenty-six students took over the Carrier Dome — where Dowches left so many memories during his own championship competitions — with a makeup heavy Tim Burton-themed show. The show in Corning following the flood garnered the most applause for the Vestal band Dowches ever heard. Be it the performance or the resilience of the group, Vestal left a mark.\n\nEven after a heart attack on April Fool's Day in 2010, stemming from over-exerting a past shoulder surgery, the Owego resident recovered in time for the St. Patrick's Day parade the following year. The band students were some of the first people at his bedside, he said.\n\n\"Being part of the marching band is the most memorable thing I've been through,\" he said.\n\nGaby Baxter remembers those tough days, as one of only two dozen students a few years ago. She followed her older brother Jeffery and sister Hattie into positions of band leadership: All three, within the last eight years, were drum majors. They managed bands ranging from 26 performers to nearly 100.\n\nLining the wall of the upstairs hallway in her Vestal home, the Baxters have eight framed show photos of the marching band, set in two rows of four. The 18-year-old adopts a higher, more excited pitch in her voice pointing out some of the friends she's made: Mama NeNe, Chi Chi. Nicknames for her might-as-well-be siblings, she said.\n\nBeing in a band connected Gaby to people she had no history with. In a tennis elective she's taking at SUNY Broome Community College, she connected to local graduates who played in a school district's parade band. They're all part of an extended family, she said.\n\n\"You have your real family, then you have your band family,\" is her simple explanation. Her parents, Jeffery and Edwina, would agree. They spent their nights creating props for the band, chaperoning at band parties. Now that all their children have grown up, out of the marching band, they don't know what to do with their nights.\n\nEven though a Baxter isn't in the band anymore, they'll be in the stands at the Golden Circle. Gaby may not feel the same rush of nervous energy as she did when she competed, but the excitement is still there.\n\n\"I can't wait for the home show.\"\n\nWarren Chan had an hour to himself last Tuesday.\n\nOne hour.\n\nSome days, that's all he gets.\n\nThe 16-year-old Vestal High School senior started class at 8 a.m. — most Tuesdays he's at the school an hour earlier for Jazz Band, but he missed the last rehearsal. When school gets out at 3 p.m., he's off to the track to work out for two hours.\n\nHis special hour is from 5 to 6 p.m., when he can rest and eat. But then he breaks out his trumpet for a 2 1/2 hour practice with the Vestal Marching Band.\n\nLike many of the students in the band, Chan has a life outside of the 80-day journey he's taken with 48 marching band mates this year.\n\nChan's multiple responsibilities sometimes make it difficult to concentrate during marching band rehearsals. He admits when he marches, his mind wanders. He thinks about his AP chemistry lab homework. Or an upcoming track practice. Boy Scouts. Science Olympiad. Sometimes puppies — huskies, mostly, because they're just cool.\n\nBut when he's in a competition, he knows to focus on doing his best.\n\n\"We were supposed to come up with goals at the beginning of the season. Mine was to play a perfect show,\" he said. When asked if he's played one yet, a half-stifled laugh ends in the word, \"No.\"\n\nDays are counting down to the New York State Field Band Conference championships, the final destination for the Vestal Marching Band. The band started its competition season with the highest score for a first performance — 64.95 — in a decade. Since that Baldwinsville show, the numbers have only gone up. It's nearly impossible to reach the ultimate score of 100, but each band in the conference tries for it.\n\nScoring higher each week means not making the same mistakes twice. Each band director receives audio, video and written notes from each competition judge. Director Greg Harris and his staff go through this documentation much like football coaches after a game and distills down suggestions for students in hand-typed pages.\n\nStaff still drill the students just as they had in band camp, but the priorities have changed. Instead of teaching and re-teaching straight-leg technique, for example, the band is perfecting and polishing the minute details of the show.\n\nA judge at the Golden Circle of Bands competition last weekend wished the rhythm echoing from African drums, played in the third movement, were in sync with each other. Harris latched on to the suggestion at a recent rehearsal, spending nearly 20 minutes on lining up the beats.\n\n\"Make sure your right hand comes a foot off the drum before you hit it,\" he instructs. \"Is it a foot up? Believe me, it will help.\"\n\nBut even Harris gets distracted when he thinks about his other responsibilities, after the marching band season is over.\n\nA week after the Syracuse championships, there will be auditions for this year's high school musical, \"Big Fish.\" Harris will sit in during student auditions, and organize a pit orchestra of mostly adults, given the high level of challenging music. Then there's the almost daily fundraising for the band's winter field trip to perform at Disney.\n\nHe knows the students in band are under the same pressures.\n\n\"I'd say it's rare when a student isn't in another band or another musical group,\" Harris said. \"If they're not, it's usually a scheduling problem. They have too much else going on.\"\n\nBut this week is the week.\n\nAlmost everything else, barring an emergency, takes a back seat to marching band. A stuffy nose or sports practice won't get you out of the final week of band rehearsal.\n\nEvery day from Monday through Sunday, excluding Tuesday as the only day of rest, is a marching band day. Three days of rehearsal — Monday, Wednesday, Thursday — to polish what needs to be polished. One Friday football game to play for a home crowd. A Saturday morning to pack up the equipment buses and have a final pep talk.\n\nThen there's Sunday. The end of the 80-day journey, when focus is essential.\n\nCompetitions, even rehearsals, are far more difficult than practicing music on the Vestal High School stage. There are more variables, more distractions, more ways to mess up.\n\n\"When they're outside, they have a lot more to deal with. They need to march, they need to watch Sara (Zuwiyya, the senior drum major), which is harder out here,\" music director Dan Miller said.\n\nChan, a six-year veteran with the marching band, helps his peers during those outdoor practices, particularly the ones marching near him.\n\nDuring the first day of band camp in August, visual captain Joshua Jenkins quietly praised Chan's marching abilities to the other staff members. Chan's skills at following marching band commands won him the Golden Dinkle, the top prize for the best marcher in the band, besting a musician who won the award two years in a row.\n\nHis name will still adorn the trophy after he goes off to college next year — he's hoping to study engineering at the United States Coast Guard Academy, but he won't know if he'll be Connecticut-bound until December.\n\nDuring that same long Tuesday, Chan gave tips to freshman rookie Yuval Tessman-Bar-On on dressing her lines, insuring she stays in the same formation with everyone else instead of being inches ahead of everyone. Take smaller steps, don't lunge into it.\n\n\"This year is a lot easier for me, I know the commands, I know how to march, so I'm able to help others more,\" he said.\n\nThe sun tips over the horizon in central New York at 7:29 a.m., and a convoy of three buses and one truck rumbles up Interstate 81, just south of Tully, in the dim dawn light.\n\nThe members of the Vestal Golden Bears Marching Band on board have already been going for hours. Ahead of them lies a very long, very big day: This stretch of road will lead them to Syracuse University's Carrier Dome and the culmination of three months of planning, practice and painstaking work for the students and their leaders.\n\nThis day, Oct. 26, is the 41st annual New York State Field Band Conference Championship, and Vestal is playing to win.\n\nMany of the teens on the bus have been awake since 4 a.m. They're shaking off the nerves with a group singalong of Queen's epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" then the Village People's \"YMCA.\"\n\nBrian Miller, a 16-year-old junior drummer, stands with arms aloft, leading his fellow students through the paces: Y, M, C and A. The jitters don't disappear entirely, but the antics help keep the mood light and the energy flowing.\n\nThey'll need that stamina for the hours ahead. The competition, which draws 52 bands from across the state in six divisions, begins at 8 a.m. and doesn't end until well after 10 p.m. The bands will be judged by a 10-member panel that will evaluate the musical and visual aspects of each marching ensemble.\n\nThe day marks the end of a grueling 80-day journey for these 49 students. The Vestal band's season began on a warm and sunny August day and will end in the windy chill of a rainy October night.\n\n\"It's just sad that it's going to be over,\" says Jamie Wu, 16, a junior mellophone player from Apalachin, in the early Sunday hours.\n\nOver three months, they've logged nearly 100 hours of practice, five competitions and one parade. They've learned the steps and the notes and the timing, but they've also learned to glide across the field in one seamless transformation after another, to be a part of something bigger than themselves. The end result is teamwork in the truest sense.\n\n\"These kids and these parents are the nicest people,\" said Joseph Cordi, father of junior drum major Bianna Cordi. \"Everyone draws so close.\"\n\nAn early start\n\nAt 5 that morning, 29-year-old band director Greg Harris — crisply dressed in a Vestal-green button-down and black tie — unlocks his office, settles behind his desk and waits for the slow, sleepy trickle of students into the adjacent band room.\n\nAmong the first to arrive is 14-year-old freshman Grace Kim, of Apalachin, who plays the alto-saxophone, at 5:15 a.m.\n\n\"It's a beautiful time to be awake,\" she says with a touch of humor.\n\nBy 5:30, most of the the student musicians, color guards and their chaperones have arrived, grabbing muffins, cookies, bananas and drinks from a table near the whiteboard and breaking off into groups, mostly boys with boys and girls with girls.\n\nHarris calls roll, then it's time to load the instruments and props into the truck and one of the three buses. Band members and chaperones are divided between two remaining buses for the 80-minute ride up the interstate.\n\nVestal will compete in Small Schools Class 3, which also includes Union-Endicott High School and is the day's first category to perform. Vestal is scheduled to take the field at 9:57 a.m. Vestal band members won't be able to catch the U-E performance; there's a run-through and other preparations to attend to.\n\nThe buses arrive at the staging area, Syracuse's Skytop, a little after 8 a.m. A steady rain falls, and a brisk, wind-driven rain whips through the open parking lot, making it feel much colder than the 46 degrees registered by the thermometer. Some parents seek shelter inside the school buses, but the band members don't have that luxury.\n\nThe brass and woodwinds separate into different corners of the lot for a short practice. The percussionists unload their instruments. Rainwater begins to puddle on the bars of the marimba, and when the band members' mallets hit home, they send out sprays of frigid water.\n\nConditions aren't the best for the practice, but Harris has seen worse in years past. And no matter how cold or miserable it is on competition day, conditions always seem far worse in the Skytop staging area, Harris said. They soldier on, even as other marching bands do the same just yards away.\n\nFinally, the woodwinds join the brass and drums for a final practice before the trip over to the Carrier Dome. Rain is now coming down in sheets. Band uniforms are growing damp.\n\nThey gather in a far corner of the parking lot, and the black shakos — band headwear — are fitted on top of their heads. The plumes — the white, feather-like accessory — are placed on top of the shakos. The students are now ready for a full-band 15-minute practice, their last before they depart for the brief bus ride to the Carrier Dome.\n\nAssistant band director Dan Miller bends down to hear the trombone and makes his final assessment.\n\n\"Do not change they way you've been,\" he tells the band.\n\nAt the Carrier Dome minutes later, event coordinators shepherd them through an air lock. The percussionists bound for the pit are escorted to the field, while others enter one of the locker rooms.\n\nFinal preparations are made. Green and gold accessories are placed on the uniforms. Only minutes to go before the balance of the band is ready to take to the field.\n\nHarris gathers his crew.\n\n\"Seniors, thank you for buying into a system,\" he says. \"I couldn't be more proud. You exceeded expectations.\"\n\nDecked out in green, black and gold, the band exits the dressing room and enters the field. Anticipation mounts. The dome's south-side lower level is filled with spectators. Bands that have already performed sit on the dome's other side.\n\nLater, Josh Lewis, 16, a baritone saxophonist from Vestal, will reflect on the moment: \"When I first walked in there, I was nothing but nerves. But then I said to myself, 'Let's just do this,' and the nerves just went away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowtime\n\nThe performance begins with a soft duet of clarinet and saxophone playing the opening notes to John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" Barely 20 seconds in, the whole band swells and sways, its members weaving in and out among each other in the intricate and highly choreographed routine they've spent months perfecting.\n\nBy this time, a nervous Harris sits back to watch. \"I just try to enjoy it,\" he says.\n\nThe 13-minute performance, named \"Around the World: An 80 Day Journey,\" is both a global-themed music extravaganza and a nod to the band's 80 days of preparations. It features six songs, including \"Shipping Up to Boston,\" traditional African, Korean and Korwan numbers, and ending with Ozzy Osborne's \"Mama I'm Coming Home.\"\n\nTwo on-field competition judges are noting strengths and faults on a digital recorder as they weave in and out of the band formations, sometimes stepping in front of band members whose precise steps have been practiced over and over again.\n\n\"That's really hard,\" Mike Schott says of the on-field judging. \"It's also stressful when you're trying not to mess up. Sometimes you'll be hearing them making criticisms, and you're somewhat offended.\"\n\n\"We tell them to ignore them,\" Miller adds. \"It's part of what they have to learn to deal with.\"\n\nAnd just like that, three months of work is distilled into 13 minutes of showtime.\n\n\"This was easily the best performance of the year,\" saxophonist Lewis says.\n\nExhilarated, exhausted group members mug for group pictures, share trays of nachos from the concession stand, catch their collective breath and await the results.\n\nA winning spirit\n\nMembers of bands in the Small School Class 3 and Small School Class 2 categories gather on the field. They stretch from end zone to end zone.\n\nTwelfth- though ninth-place finishers are announced. Vestal isn't among them. Then, the announcer names the eighth-place winners: \"The Golden — Falcons.\"\n\nThe Golden Bears are still safe.\n\nBy finishing higher than eighth, the Vestal band has already surpassed its best performance in at least seven years.\n\nSeventh place goes to the Marcus Whitman Wildcats.\n\nAnd then, with a score of 76.4 out of 100, the Vestal marching band comes in sixth.\n\nUltimately, the highly respected U-E marching band takes the top prize. But Vestal's score and rank was the school's best showing since 2007.\n\n\"We shattered the record,\" said Sara Zuwiyya, senior drum major. \"I'm happy that we put on our best show.\"\n\nLater, band members saw it this way: They were the fourth-smallest band, but their score was better than seven other bands in their category. They rose two spots from last year's eighth-place finish. Put simply, members said, they put on a show that made them proud.\n\nWhat happens next? The band heads back to Vestal, stopping en route for a celebratory lunch in Cortland. They unload their equipment and stash it in the band room or the so-called \"dungeon\" space. Then the band members, such a cohesive unit on the field just hours earlier, scatter into cars and head toward home.\n\nThey'll reconvene for a few more parades, but this is the final page of the band calendar their director printed up for them at the beginning of the school year. There will be no more practices and no more competitions.\n\nOf course, the band members have plenty to do; they're still students, after all. Take drum major Zuwiyya, who plans to fill her schedule with college applications (she expects to enter an engineering undergraduate program next August) and catch up on homework.\n\nBut for the marching band, Harris says, \"There is no next week.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/10/23/westminster-dog-show-surgeon-general-cited-las-vegas-casino-debut-news-around-states/114466760/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, who has called the state’s mask order a government overstep, announced Wednesday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. Ainsworth said he had a positive test result but has no symptoms. He said he took the test after being notified Wednesday that a member of his Sunday school church group had acquired the coronavirus. Ainsworth has criticized mandatory mask orders, although he said he personally wears one. “Because I follow social distancing rules and wear a mask both in church and in my daily interactions, the positive result shows that even those of us who are the most cautious can be at risk,” Ainsworth said in a statement. Ainsworth said he “will quarantine for the appropriate period and seek follow-up tests to ensure the virus has run its course before resuming public activities.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, is encouraging Alaskans to vote early amid the ongoing spread of COVID-19. “I think if COVID has taught us anything, it’s that if we’re kind and we work together and we plan ahead, we’re better off,” Zink said, adding that one never knows if they might come in contact with an infected person and have to quarantine. More than 120,000 people have requested absentee ballots, mostly for delivery by mail, according to the Division of Elections. More than 7,600 have voted in person since early voting started Monday, division statistics showed. Division Director Gail Fenumiai, in a teleconference with reporters also attended by Zink and state health Commissioner Adam Crum on Tuesday, said elections and health officials encourage those with health concerns to take advantage of absentee voting options. Besides requesting ballots by mail, voters can ask to get ballots sent to them via email or fax. Fenumiai said the division is taking the same precautions for the Nov. 3 general election that it took for in-person voting in the primary. Those measures include having available for voters masks, gloves and hand sanitizer; having markers to help waiting voters maintain distance; and requiring poll workers to wear masks or face shields and to clean equipment and surfaces throughout the day. Officials strongly encourage voters to wear masks, she said.\n\nArizona\n\nKingman: The city has joined two others in Mohave County in repealing a local mask mandate imposed to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. The City Council voted 4-3 on Tuesday to repeal the requirement that people over age 6 wear face coverings when entering places of business, The Miner reported. Mayor Jen Miles had extended Kingman’s requirement in August through 2020, and the council voted 5-2 in September to keep the proclamation in effect through Tuesday pending a review. Miles voted Tuesday against lifting the mandate. Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City, the county’s other two population centers, lifted their mask mandates last month. Arizona on Wednesday reported 975 new confirmed coronavirus cases and another 17 deaths as the state continues to see an elevated spread of COVID-19. The numbers reported by the Arizona Department of Health Services bring the total to 233,912 known cases and 5,854 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two state lawmakers on Wednesday said they tested positive for the coronavirus, the latest in an outbreak among legislators that has prompted the suspension of state budget hearings this week. State Sen. Missy Irvin and state Rep. Joe Cloud confirmed that they contracted the virus, the fourth and fifth lawmakers to do so this week. Legislative leaders announced Tuesday that three lawmakers tested positive and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was limiting his public appearances after learning he had been exposed to someone with the virus. Hutchinson added that he had tested negative twice since the exposure. “I am at home recovering,” Irvin tweeted. “Praying for my colleagues and everyone who is suffering with this virus.” Cloud, who said he developed symptoms on Saturday, noted that he had been at budget hearings at the Capitol last week. “There’s no way to know where exactly I contracted it, but obviously there was some spread,” Cloud said. Three senators and six House members have now tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began in March.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A California appeals court has ordered state corrections officials to cut the population of one of the world’s most famous prisons to less than half of its designed capacity, citing officials’ “deliberate indifference” to the plight of inmates during the coronavirus pandemic. State prison officials said Wednesday that they are deciding whether to appeal the order, which otherwise will force them to parole or transfer about 1,100 inmates serving time in San Quentin State Prison north of San Francisco. California’s oldest prison, home to its death row, was the site of one of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, with 28 inmate deaths and 2,200 infections at its peak – about 75% of the inmate population. Nearly 300 employees were sickened and one died, though all but nine employees are now back to work. It was “the worst epidemiological disaster in California correctional history,” the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco said in Tuesday’s ruling. The three-justice court said officials’ decision not to cut the inmate population by half, as recommended by prison officials’ outside advisors in June, was “morally indefensible and constitutionally untenable.” State officials “respectfully disagree with the court’s determination,” corrections department spokeswoman Dana Simas said in an email, saying the department “has taken extensive actions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A large food service contractor has announced plans to lay off 975 workers, most of whom work at Coors Field and are responsible for concession stands that were closed during the season because of the coronavirus pandemic. Aramark informed the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment on Tuesday that the company plans to dismiss 71 bartenders at the Mission Ballroom in Denver and 904 workers at Coors Field, where the Colorado Rockies play, The Denver Post reported. The stadium workers include beverage attendants, cashiers, cooks, food prep workers, bussers, hosts, security workers, suite attendants and food stand staff. Many had no one to serve because no fans were allowed at Major League Baseball games in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The first batch of local public health agencies has begun receiving state grants to help cover the cost of contact tracing for COVID-19 infections, testing and other expenses as Connecticut begins seeing localized pockets of cases. The money announced Wednesday is coming from the $20 million the Connecticut Department of Public Health received from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. It will be distributed over three years to local public health departments and districts, which are taking the lead on tracking down new cases. The grant amounts are based on per-capita and poverty levels in the communities. All local health districts and departments are eligible for the funding, said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner at the state’s Department of Public Health. Applications from 21 of the state’s 65 local health districts and departments have so far been approved. Although local health departments are handling the initial contact tracing calls, Gifford said the state has hired 105 full-time contact tracers for a backup system to provide extra surge capacity to the local public health authorities.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach:The city canceled its annual public tree lighting because of COVID-19 restrictions, but the city’s Christmas tree will still be on display and lit throughout the holiday season, according to a statement the city released Tuesday. Every year, thousands of people attend the ceremony, which usually takes place at the Bandstand just after Thanksgiving and features a sing-along and a tall, well-lit tree that’s hard to miss. This year’s tree was donated by Jerry Owens of Lewes. And although the actual ceremony was canceled, that shouldn’t stop folks from visiting Rehoboth Beach for the holiday season. City officials “encourage all visitors to enjoy the many forms of holiday spirit our hard-working businesses provide,” according to the statement. Holiday music will be played at the Bandstand and surrounding businesses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A review board ruled DC Public Schools violated the law when leaders announced a school reopening plan for Nov. 9 without negotiating with the Washington Teachers’ Union, WUSA-TV reported. Still, DCPS Chancellor Lewis Ferebee held a town hall meeting Wednesday night to discuss plans to return 21,000 students to elementary schools. “If it's so safe, why don't we have in-person meetings to discuss this?” said Tiffany Brown, ANC 7B02 Commissioner and longtime DCPS teacher. “It can't be safe if the chancellor is sitting in an elementary school in Ward 7 with a mask on! He never takes off his mask to speak. We could barely hear him. If these school buildings are safe, invite the public in!” Ferebee never responded to parents’ online questions about the ruling by the Public Employees Relations Board that the reopen plan violates the law because the WTU was left out of the safety plan. DCPS did send WUSA-TV a statement insisting they have held focus groups with teachers and engaged the union “in more than 100 hours of discussions.” When Term 2 begins next month, all in-person operations will be consistently monitored following D.C. Health's COVID-19 compliance.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: State health officials held off of releasing their usual coronavirus update Wednesday as they announced a more thorough review of all fatalities reported to the state. Fatality data reported to the state consistently present confusion and warrant a more rigorous review, according to a Department of Health news release. Of the 95 fatalities reported to the state Tuesday, which would have been released publicly Wednesday, 11 of the deaths occurred more than a month ago. Also, 16 deaths had more than a two-month separation between the time the individuals tested positive and died, and five of those had a gap of more than three months. “During a pandemic, the public must be able to rely on accurate public health data to make informed decisions,” Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said in a statement. “To ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 related deaths, the Department will be performing additional reviews of all deaths. Timely and accurate data remains a top priority of the Department of Health.” Palm Beach County had 50 of the 95 coronavirus deaths reported Tuesday, health officials said. That nearly doubled a previous one-day record of 27 in August.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens:The number of COVID-19 cases reported by the University of Georgia dropped slightly last week, but case rates in Clarke County and Georgia continued to edge up. The university reported 84 COVID-19 cases for the week ending Oct. 18, down from 96 the previous week. Those cases included 20 positive tests at the University Health Center, which tests people with symptoms, and 25 detected in surveillance testing. The university tested 2,029 people at its Legion Field site and pop-up sites, a record for the school, according to a news release. About 1.2% of those tests were positive, including 21 students and four staff members. Other positives in the overall 84 cases were reported from other sources. The university also issued a call earlier this month for the 729 faculty members teaching large classes to be tested; 321 responded, and just one test came back positive, according to the university. In Clarke County, the positivity rate in testing over the past two weeks remained at 4.3%, the lowest among Clarke and adjacent counties. Oglethorpe continues to have the highest positivity rate in testing at 12.4. Jackson at 9.9, Barrow at 8.1 and Oconee at 5.4 are also relatively high.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An attorney for U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Wednesday that his client, who is charged with illegally entering a Hawaii public park that was closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, will plead not guilty. The criminal complaint against Adams, who was on Oahu in August helping with surge testing amid a spike in coronavirus cases, said he and two other men were looking at the view and taking pictures at Kualoa Regional Park on the island’s northeastern coast. The rural park offers a view of the famed Mokolii island, also known as Chinaman’s Hat for its cone shape. Adams did not appear in court or on a video call for the hearing, but his attorney, Michael Green, said his client understands the charge and will plead not guilty. Because the charge is a “full misdemeanor,” the judge said the not guilty plea could not be entered until Adams decided if he would waive his right to a jury trial. Green said Adams would not waive that right. The judge set an arraignment date of Nov. 2 in circuit court. Adams told a police officer who cited him that he was visiting Hawaii to work with Gov. David Ige on COVID-19 and didn’t know parks were closed. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell had closed them at the time to try to prevent crowding that could spread the virus. Violating any of the mayor’s emergency orders is punishable as a misdemeanor, with fines of up to $5,000, up to a year in jail or both. A few days after the citation, Adams appeared with Caldwell at a news conference announcing a partnership between the city and federal government for surge testing.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur D’Alene: People with COVID-19 in Northern Idaho soon might have to be sent to Seattle or Portland, Oregon, because the region’s hospitals are nearing capacity. Kootenai Health hospital said in a statement Wednesday that their hospital is at 99% capacity for patients. The facility is also short-staffed, as demand for nurses grows with the rise in COVID-19 cases throughout the country, the statement said.“Because all regional hospitals are experiencing the same situation, there will be limited opportunities to transfer patients to other facilities once at capacity,” the hospital said. “If there is no room available, Kootenai Health is currently looking at hospitals in Seattle or Portland to find space to transfer patients, but it is very limited.” As of Wednesday morning, Kootenai Health had 31 COVID-19 inpatients and 11 required critical care. Chief Physician Executive Karen Cabell told KREM the hospital nearing capacity at its current levels is “unprecedented.” Kootenai Health will not turn anyone away, but there might be long wait times and patients might receive treatment in different locations such as the waiting room, Cabell said. In the southern Idaho city of Twin Falls, St. Luke’s Hospital has had to cancel all elective surgery for the month to accommodate an influx of COVID-19 patients. One in every four patients there is stricken with COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: As the state fights a recalcitrant coronavirus pandemic, Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday started laying plans for distributing a safe and effective vaccine. But other than saying that a vaccine would go first to health care providers, long-term care residents and other vulnerable populations, Pritzker, at his renewed daily COVID-19 briefing, offered few details, saying much depends on what the federal government approves to prevent the virus. “The challenge of designing a plan now, of course, is that there’s so much about the vaccines that we don’t know,” Pritizker said in Chicago. “The most defining characteristic of this plan is that it’s adjustable as we go forward and learn more.” Details such as whether a vaccine will require one or more than one dose to be effective, whether it needs refrigerated storage or could be stored at room temperature, and even how a vaccine delivered in large containers will be broken down for specimens to be shipped to small health care facilities will affect the state plan, Pritzker said. Talk of a coming vaccine offered a bit of good news rarely available from the Democratic governor in the past week, after record-setting days for new infections and tighter restrictions starting in the coming days for parts of the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:State officials are expanding efforts to address a surge of coronavirus cases in long-term care facilities as the state continues to record sharp increases in hospitalizations and new infections. More than 55% of the state’s recorded COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term care facilities and the case counts in such environments continue to rise, said State Health Department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Lindsay Weaver. To slow the spread of the virus, Weaver and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb announced during a news briefing Wednesday that the state will employ members of Indiana National Guard to help with infection control practices, including improved COVID-19 testing for long-term care facility residents and employees. New rounds of protective gear like masks, gowns and face shields are also being shipped to the facilities, Holcomb said. Additionally, the state will hire more clinical staff who have volunteered to help as part of the reserve workforce, allowing all facilities to be visited at least three times a week to ensure proper health protocols are in place. Long-term care facilities with one or more confirmed COVID-19 cases will be prioritized, Holcomb said. The goal is to have plans in motion by Nov. 1 and for efforts to continue for the rest of year.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration will try to convince federal auditors to reverse course and approve its plan to spend $21 million in coronavirus relief funds on a long-planned information technology upgrade. Reynolds said Wednesday that the state believes spending federal virus aid to purchase and implement a new accounting and human resources system for the executive branch is “an allowable expense,” even though state and federal auditors disagree. “We’re going to reach out (to the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General) and talk about why we believe it was an appropriate expense and hopefully we’ll get the answer we think we should get,” Reynolds told reporters. “And if not, we’ll readjust and do what we need to do. We’re not going to spend dollars in a manner that is not appropriate.” State Auditor Rob Sand said Monday that the use of pandemic funds for the Workday project was inappropriate. He warned that Iowa would be on the hook to repay the federal government $21 million if the funds are not diverted to an allowable use, such as virus testing, contact tracing and personal protective equipment. The Treasury Department’s deputy inspector general also told the state in an Oct. 16 letter that the spending would not be allowed, noting the Workday contract was signed before the pandemic. He said the money spent so far should be returned to the state’s $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund and used for another purpose.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is again calling for a statewide mask mandate as the coronavirus case count continues to climb in rural parts of the state that don’t require them. Kelly said Wednesday that two-thirds of the state’s COVID-19 cases are now coming from outside the Wichita and Kansas City regions. Over the summer, she issued an order requiring Kansas residents to wear masks, but more than 90 counties chose to opt out. She said she now plans to speak with House and Senate leadership to work toward a bipartisan requirement with more teeth. “We cannot sit by as the cases continue to rise in our rural communities, threatening lives and businesses,” she said. On Monday, the health department in rural Norton County reported a coronavirus outbreak killed 10 residents in a nursing home in northwestern Kansas. It said all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the virus. Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, a Republican from Overland Park, said in a statement shared by a spokesman that he had not been contacted by the governor’s office to discuss a statewide mask mandate yet but is “happy to talk and discuss a mask mandate because it is better than a business shutdown, which he doesn’t want to talk about.” Denning added that he wants the discussions to include a statewide testing plan that is “crucial to dealing with the virus.”\n\nKentucky\n\nWilmore:A coronavirus outbreak at the state’s Thomson-Hood Veterans Center has led to 71 veterans testing positive and six deaths. Earlier this month, as COVID-19 cases grew in Jessamine County, several employees at the veterans center contracted the virus, and an outbreak among the center’s nearly 160 veterans swiftly followed. “It was just a rapid spread, an unbelievably fast spread,” said Mark Bowman, executive director of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs. Although officials believe they have the outbreak under control, they remain concerned about the risk to Thomson-Hood’s residents because Jessamine County is listed as red on the state’s COVID-19 map, indicating uncontrolled spread of the virus. “They are in a red county,” said Eric Friedlander, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, which oversees nursing homes. “When you have a facility in a hot county, it’s much more difficult to keep COVID out.” Bowman said many of Thomson-Hood’s 210 employees live in Jessamine County or Fayette County, which also has seen a spike in cases of COVID-19.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to keep Louisiana’s emergency orders from governing churches and to upend prosecution of a pastor who violated Gov. John Bel Edwards’ coronavirus restrictions was narrowly shelved Wednesday by state senators. A Senate judiciary committee voted 3-2 to kill the bill by Oil City Republican Rep. Danny McCormick that would have prohibited government agencies or officials from being able to fine, penalize or prosecute anyone who attends or conducts a church service during a publicly declared emergency. The measure, which had won House support in a 66-24 vote, sought to apply its provisions to any actions pending when the bill became law. The move was aimed at disrupting the prosecution of Tony Spell, minister at Life Tabernacle Church in Central, for violating Edwards’ ban on large gatherings. Spell was charged in April with several misdemeanor offenses for repeatedly holding in-person church services with hundreds of people not distanced from each other, in defiance of the governor’s restrictions on crowd sizes at the time. Spell also was arrested later on an assault charge after authorities said he drove a church bus toward a man protesting his decision. The cases are pending. Edwards has since loosened crowd size limits on churches and many other places.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said she was “disappointed” that Vice President Mike Pence held a campaign rally in Hermon on Monday that appeared to exceed the state’s attendance limit for outdoor gatherings. Pence held the event to tout President Donald Trump’s reelection bid and promote Maine Republicans. The state limits outdoor gatherings to 100 people. Maine Republican Party Executive Director Jason Savage said there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people in attendance. Savage was dismissive of criticism of the event. “I guess we’ll have to call it a ‘peaceful protest.’ Gov. Mills and her pals should be fine then,” Savage said in an e-mail.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Washington County Community Action Council officials said they want to help people struggling to pay bills during the coronavirus pandemic so they don’t lose their homes or have utilities turned off. But they said those people need to ask for help. “It’s very rare to be in our situation and have money to spend. Unfortunately, clients are not coming in,” said Geordie Newman, the council’s president and CEO. The nonprofit, based in downtown Hagerstown, has been seeing more new clients, including families that have had to ask for help for the first time because of the pandemic’s effect on the economy. But it also has secured $1.1 million in supplemental aid, spending $338,131 of it as of the end of Monday, Newman said. The nonprofit also is expecting another $920,000 in aid through an Emergency Solutions Grant from the Maryland Department of Housing & Community Development, but Newman said he doesn’t anticipate that money being available until early 2021. About half of the coming grant will be restricted to helping homeless people get into sustainable housing, Newman said. As of Monday, the council had helped 159 households, or 493 individuals.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City schools will switch to all-remote learning in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases in the city, Mayor Marty Walsh and Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said in a statement. The switch to remote-only learning started Thursday. The city’s seven-day average COVID-19 positive test rate is 5.7%, an increase from last week’s rate of 4.5%. There have been two weeks of increased confirmed positive cases across the city. Students will remain in remote learning until there are two full weeks of falling infection rates, according to the statement. Although the city started remote learning Sept. 21, students considered high-need, including those with special needs, English learners, those experiencing homelessness, and those who are in state care had been allowed to resume in-person classes. Earlier this month, the city pushed back the in-person start date for preschoolers and kindergartners from Oct. 15 instead until Thursday. That has now been delayed again. Cassellius said she was “heartbroken” that high-need students are now affected.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State officials said Wednesday that indoor visits can resume at nursing homes and other residential care facilities for the first time in seven months, except in counties with higher daily coronavirus case rates. The emergency order, issued by the state Department of Health and Human Services the same day Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned COVID-19 is surging, takes effect Monday. Indoor visitation has been prohibited since March because of the pandemic, except for an end-of-life situation, grave illness or to support activities of daily living. “As we grapple with both colder weather and rising cases, our task is to increase access to visitation in ways that do not increase the spread of the virus,” said Robert Gordon, the department’s director. “Visitation is a substantial source of risk. This order provides a plan for visitation that mitigates risk and continues necessary protections in facilities across the state.” For now, visits will not be allowed in 32 of Michigan’s 83 counties – those with an “E” risk level, where the daily number of new COVID-19 cases per million is more than 150 or the number of tests turning up positive is more than 20%. Facilities in 51 counties will be able to have visitors inside if they have had no new cases in the prior 14 days and the local health department has not barred visits. Visits will be by appointment only. Visitors must wear a mask. Many people visiting facilities in counties with a “C” or “D” risk level – 47 counties currently – will first have to be tested. Most nursing homes now are able to do rapid tests, the state said. Republican lawmakers who have pushed the Whitmer administration for changes called the order a positive step.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Salvation Army said 20 of its staff members from Minnesota and North Dakota tested positive for the coronavirus after 62 people attended a recent conference in northern Minnesota. “Despite adherence to the health guidance, we fully acknowledge that COVID-19 is formidable and highly contagious,” Salvation Army spokesman Dan Furry said in a statement Tuesday, the Star Tribune reported. Of the 20 infected people who attended the conference in Finlayson, none was hospitalized, Furry said, and the Salvation Army was still awaiting results from some attendees of the Oct. 6-8 event. The nonprofit shut down its Roseville headquarters as a precaution, boosted cleanings of its sites and quarantined all conference attendees, he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is expanding access to curbside voting for people with symptoms of COVID-19 and setting a new process to let voters correct, or “cure,” minor discrepancies with signatures on absentee ballots. The changes are being made after voting-rights groups sued the state in federal court. U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan signed an order Tuesday that ends the lawsuit. The plaintiffs obtained some of the changes they sought, but not all. A new rule issued by Secretary of State Michael Watson said curbside or open-air voting must be made available to people showing signs of COVID-19, including coughing, vomiting, headaches, fever, sore throat, congestion, or loss of taste or smell. Also, election officials must notify a voter about any problem with his or her signature on an absentee ballot, and the voter must be given a chance to correct it, according to groups that sued the state. Officials must offer the voter an “absentee cure form” by mail, email or fax within one business day. The voter has 10 calendar days after the election to correct the issue so the ballot can be counted. Jennifer Nwachukwu, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement that the new procedures should help ensure that absentee ballots are not “arbitrarily rejected.” Mississippi requires absentee ballot applications to be notarized. The state also requires most people to provide an excuse to vote absentee, such as being out of town on Election Day. The plaintiffs argued those two requirements are unconstitutional. However, those procedures are not being changed.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday called lawmakers back to work for a special session to give his administration the authority to dole out additional federal coronavirus aid funding. Parson said the session is necessary to allow the state to hand out federal money for school food programs, job training, homelessness prevention, domestic violence grants and child support payments. Democratic House Minority Leader Crystal Quade in a statement called the special session a “political stunt” that’s scheduled to begin two days after the Nov. 3 election, when voters will decide whether to give Parson four more years in office or replace him with Democratic Auditor Nicole Galloway.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A long-term care facility has been sued after health officials said its staff was negligent and allowed the coronavirus to spread through the facility in Whitefish earlier this year. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday by the estates of three residents at Whitefish Care and Rehabilitation who died because of complications caused by COVID-19, the Missoulian reported. The lawsuit represented the estates of Alton Johnson, Berton Pew and Stanley Webber, and argued that at least 13 people died at the facility because of the outbreak. The county had 23 coronavirus-related deaths. The Heenan and Cook firm of Billings and McGarvey Law in Kalispell are representing each of the estates. The lawsuit named the 100-bed long-term care facility and its administrator Reid Crickmore. Crickmore did not respond to an email or phone message from the Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment. Montana Public Radio reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report in September saying the facility’s noncompliance had placed the health and safety of its residents at risk. The Daily Inter Lake then reported that the agency rated the facility in “immediate jeopardy.” The lawsuit claimed that Whitefish Care and Rehabilitation did not implement COVID-19 safety measures recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The lawsuit also argues that 75% of the residents at the facility have contracted the virus since late August, with the first case having been reported on Aug. 12.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Nebraska continued to set records as the total number of virus cases surged above 60,000 on Wednesday. The state said 400 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, up from the previous day’s record of 380. Health officials said they are working with hospitals across the state to make sure they have capacity to treat all those patients, and the state has offered $40 million to help hospitals add capacity as needed. Nebraska reported 899 new virus cases and 11 new deaths Wednesday on its online virus tracker to give the state 60,308 cases and 576 deaths since the pandemic began. The rate of new cases in the state remains fifth-highest in the nation, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The rate of new cases per 100,000 Nebraska residents over the past two weeks increased to 565.6 on Wednesday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: If the 1,000-seat sports betting auditorium at the Circa Resort & Casino doesn’t get you, maybe the six rooftop swimming pools will. “We expect more than 4,000 people a day at Stadium Swim,” hotel co-owner Derek Stevens said during a recent preview of his sun-and-sports property set to open early next Wednesday in downtown Las Vegas. It will be the only casino-hotel in town only serving people 21 and older. Identification will be checked at the door. Facial coverings and temperature scans also will be required. Even during the coronavirus pandemic, Stevens predicted eye-popping sights for ticket-buyers making the trip downtown and the minute-plus ride up an escalator he called the longest in Las Vegas. Circa plans to open some hotel rooms and suites Dec. 28. Its eventual 777 rooms is modestly small in a tourist destination where resorts number rooms in the thousands and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority keeps tabs on nearly 150,000 rooms. Not all casinos have reopened following closures that Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered in mid-March to prevent crowds from gathering and spreading COVID-19. Boyd Gaming’s downtown Main Street Station across from Circa remains shuttered. The number of visitors to the region this year has been less than half the number in 2019, the tourism authority reported. The rate of coronavirus infections is rising in Nevada. But the governor, a Democrat, said Tuesday the spike is similar to what other states are experiencing, and he has no plans to call for closures and other restrictions. At 458 feet and 35 stories tall, Circa bookends Fremont Street with the D Las Vegas – now the second-tallest downtown hotel – also co-owned by Stevens and his brother, Greg. They also own the Golden Gate, which opened in 1906.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Crime victims will not have their testimony broadcast online without their consent under new court rules in New Hampshire aimed at balancing public health and public access to jury trials during the coronavirus pandemic. After being suspended for six months, Superior Court trials resumed in late August, with limited in-person attendance and online livestreaming to allow the public to view the proceedings. But the rules drew complaints from the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence after Cheshire County Attorney Chris McLaughlin said his office was forced to drop second-degree assault charges against a college student because the victim backed out of testifying when she learned her testimony would be broadcast online. Court officials said Wednesday they worked with the coalition, prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop new rules. Going forward, if a victim does not consent to a livestream, the court will reserve space in the courtroom for public access.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy tested negative for COVID-19 on Wednesday, his office said, just hours after he abruptly left an event, saying he just found out a person he was in contact with over the weekend tested positive for the virus. Murphy, a Democrat, was speaking at a workforce development event his office organized with Democratic Rep. Donald Norcross at Camden County College when he said he had just learned a contact had tested positive. The governor, 63, said he has no symptoms and last tested negative on Monday. Murphy spokesperson Mahen Gunaratna said later the governor and first lady Tammy Murphy tested negative for the virus Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what kind of test the governor and first lady took. Murphy’s office identified the contact as Murphy’s deputy chief of staff. Gunaratna’s statement said he is quarantining at home. “We have begun the contact tracing process to notify everyone who may have come into contact with our colleague during the potential infection window,” he added.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Health officials on Wednesday reported a single-day record of 827 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and eight additional deaths. The latest numbers increase the total cases to 38,715 statewide since the pandemic started, with 950 known deaths. Of the new cases, New Mexico Department of Health officials said 292 of them were in Bernalillo County and 172 more in Dona Ana County. New Mexico had set a single-day record with 819 confirmed COVID-19 cases last Friday with 557 more cases Saturday, 518 on Sunday, another 518 cases Monday and 599 on Tuesday. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The Westminster dog show is set to take a long walk. The nation’s top pooch pageant will be held outdoors in 2021 at an estate about 25 miles north of Manhattan on June 12-13 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Westminster Kennel Club said Wednesday. The shift to the Lyndhurst site along the Hudson River in Tarrytown will mark the first time in more than 100 years that best in show at Westminster hasn’t been awarded at Madison Square Garden. In 1920, the top prize was presented at Grand Central Palace in New York. Four different versions of the Garden have played host to Westminster since 1880 – the show began three years earlier. The show is typically held in February, around Valentine’s Day. “The wide-open outdoor space at this extraordinary venue allows us to hold a dog show safely while following current social distancing guidelines and public health regulations,” WKC President Charlton Reynders III said in a statement. Breed and group judging will be held both days, and best in show will be chosen June 13 and televised by Fox. The 67-acre Lyndhurst site has held dog shows over the years. There will be 207 breeds eligible at the next Westminster, including three newcomers: the Belgian Laekenois, the dogo Argentino and the barbet. Siba the standard poodle won best in show last February at the Garden.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A COVID-19 outbreak linked to a multiday church event has left at least two people dead, health officials said Wednesday. Mecklenburg County authorities said there are now 68 cases since the local health department initially reported the outbreak on Saturday, The Charlotte Observer reported. That was one week after the conclusion of the Oct. 4-11 event at the United House of Prayer for All People in Charlotte. The county said at least four people have been hospitalized. Officials said the county was set to hold a no-cost, drive-thru testing event at a health department site on Thursday and Friday near the church. United House of Prayer leaders have not agreed to conduct testing on site, Mecklenburg health officials told county commissioners Tuesday. Deputy Health Director Raynard Washington said he has been in daily contact with the pastor of the church. He said the church has encouraged members to get tested. County officials also have notified other local health departments in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey and New York to monitor for cases connected to the church events. At least six people who live at Madison Saints Paradise Independent Living have confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the county. At least four of those people attended events at the church, Washington told reporters Wednesday night. And one of the people who has died was connected to that cluster at Madison Saints Paradise Independent Living, Washington said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials said they want to repurpose $16 million in federal coronavirus aid and spend it on grants to encourage fracking instead of using it to clean up abandoned oil well sites. Regulators have presented the proposal as a way to create jobs and help stabilize state revenue, although some in the environmental community view it as a bailout for the oil industry, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Under the proposal, which the North Dakota Emergency Commission will consider Friday, oil companies would be eligible for a $200,000 reimbursement per well they complete. They could use the money for acquiring and disposing of water used in the hydraulic fracturing process, in which water, sand and chemicals are injected underground to crack rock and release oil. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said oil companies have been hit hard by the price drop resulting from the pandemic, leading to slow work in the state’s oil fields. The Sierra Club, however, called it “totally inappropriate” to put some of the $1.25 billion the state received under the coronavirus rescue package toward fracking.\n\nOhio\n\nCircleville:Although the coronavirus pandemic canceled the Circleville Pumpkin Show, which has run since 1903 and bills itself as Ohio’s oldest and largest festival, no one in the Circleville Giant Pumpkin Growers Club was going to let a pandemic steal every bit of their joy. Longtime emcee Ernie Weaver decided the people who grow these massive pumpkins were going to get their day to shine. And so came about the Circleville Pumpkin No-Show Giant Pumpkin Weigh-in. On Wednesday morning, people lined up in more than two dozen trucks and vans so that they could see how well they hadd done with their patches this season. The weigh-in was held at the Pickaway County Fairgrounds so that people could safely keep their distance. A few dozen townspeople came to watch, setting up lawn chairs near the table that held the the winners' trophies. But mostly, the crowd was the growers and their friends. Bob “Doc” Liggett, 81, of Circleville, who holds the event record with a 1,964-pounder, won this year’s event with a 1,755.5-pounder. Rusty Ortman of Chillicothe finished second with a 1725.5-pounder.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized in Oklahoma because of the coronavirus pandemic jumped by nearly 50 on Wednesday to a one-day record of 870, up from 821 a day earlier, the State Department of Health reported. State officials on Tuesday announced a plan to deal with a surge in the number of people hospitalized by transferring patients when certain regions become overwhelmed. Oklahoma remains in the red zone for both confirmed cases and test positivity, and more than half of the state’s 77 counties reporting high levels of community transmission, according to the latest White House Coronavirus Task Force Report released Wednesday. The health department reported another 19 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, bringing the statewide death toll to 1,210 since the pandemic began in March. Health officials also reported another 1,307 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Oklahoma to 110,855.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Salem Cinema art house movie theater will begin showing films Friday for the first time in seven months. The owner said she can't afford to stay closed any longer. After it and all other movie theaters in Oregon closed in March when the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered businesses of all sizes, Salem Cinema owner Loretta Miles was forced to close the theater she has been associated with for 37 years. Patrons have donated money and participated in crowdfunding campaigns and virtual showings to help keep the theater afloat financially during its closure.“I’m very much in debt right now,” Miles said. “I’ve been without a personal income for seven months. We had some commercial rent protections that have now expired.\" She said she was protected from being evicted, but now must cover the rent. Movie theaters in Marion and Polk counties have been allowed to open since lower COVID-19 rates moved them into Phase 2 on June 19, but few did initially. Miles said she is also considering other strategies to get customers in the door, such as a night of old Kung Fu movies or offering more mainstream movies that won’t otherwise be screened in Salem because of the Regal theaters being closed. She said Salem Cinema hasn’t been able to get any of the grants or loans for businesses impacted by COVID-19, so reopening is her only option, even in a time when other theaters are closing.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBeaver: A large, for-profit nursing home where dozens of residents died of COVID-19 was sued Wednesday over allegations that it failed to take basic steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, near the Ohio border, was among the hardest-hit nursing homes in the state, with more than 330 residents infected and 73 deaths, according to the state Department of Health. It has been under federal and state criminal investigation over its handling of the virus. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of five current residents and the families of 10 residents who died, alleged that Brighton’s operators chronically understaffed the facility, which forced the nursing staff to “cut corners while struggling to care for hundreds of residents during the pandemic.” Brighton didn’t have an infection control program, allowing the virus to spread unchecked, the suit said. Citing a state inspection, it said Brighton didn’t even keep soap or paper towels at hand-washing sinks. Among the suit’s dozens of allegations: Brighton failed to separate infected residents from those who had tested negative, allowed staffers who had contracted the virus to continue to work while infected, and provided inaccurate information about the outbreak to family members and health officials. Brighton said in a statement released by its public relations firm that it has “worked to closely follow the guidance of governmental health officials,” asserting that it has gone months without a new case of COVID-19. “Right now, the facility’s sole focus remains on ensuring the health and well-being of all residents and staff,” the statement said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases on the rise, Gov. Gina Raimondo on Wednesday urged Rhode Islanders to scale back their Thanksgiving holiday plans by avoiding out-of-state travel and limiting celebrations to just those who live within the same household. For people planning to attend larger gatherings, she suggested that for 14 days before they holiday, they do all they can to minimize their exposure to the coronavirus by skipping social gatherings, nonessential activities and travel. People should also get tested, even if they are asymptomatic. “This is the best way to avoid spreading the virus to our loved and for us, as a state, to avoid having major problems in the weeks after Thanksgiving,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. A similar strategy for the return to college students to the state worked, she said. People attending larger family gatherings with people from multiple households should wear masks, socially distance, avoid sharing food and drink, and avoid close contact activities such as traditional back yard football games, she said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Organizers said thousands of people turned out to peer at agricultural exhibits from their car windows and grab to-go funnel cakes at a drive-thru fair in Columbia. The more than 150-year-old state fair couldn’t go off as usual this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, so organizers devised a drive-thru version that was held Tuesday and Wednesday. Fair Manager Nancy Smith said in a news release that more than 10,000 people came through in cars on the first day, and one person arrived at 4:30 a.m. because he wanted to be the first person in line. There weren’t any rides. But the fair website said drive-thru exhibits included old fire trucks, livestock and a calliope. Drive-thru food stands sold fair food, including funnel cakes and corn dogs, and workers wearing face masks handed orders to people in their cars. “Safety has always been our first priority, and we are so thrilled to see how our patrons have embraced the changes while still showing tremendous support for the fair,” Smith said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpringfield:Almost 300 inmates at the Mike Durfee State Prison have tested positive for COVID-19 and about 1 in 4 inmates at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls has the virus. Three South Dakota prison facilities have now seen more than 100 inmates test positive for the coronavirus. The South Dakota Department of Corrections reported that 294 inmates at the Mike Durfee State Prison have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 131 from Wednesday. Mike Durfee is a minimum to medium security facility that's formerly a college campus in Springfield, where some inmates are three to a room. The positive cases make up 28% of the inmate population. Two of those cases have recovered, and 297 have tested negative. Staff there have reported 11 cases, six of which have recovered, and 28 negative cases. Inmate transfers to and from the facility are temporarily suspended, DOC spokesman Michael Winder said last week. Classes, skills training and work programs at the prison are also temporarily suspended. The South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls is the most recent facility to balloon past 100 cases. The facility reports that a total of 162 have tested positive as of Thursday, up 123 cases from the 39 that were reported Wednesday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Health has revealed its plan to distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they become available. According to a news release, the agency submitted its draft proposal to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week. The plan was made public on Wednesday. “We assure Tennesseans that safe, effective and approved COVID-19 vaccines will be released in Tennessee when they are available to reduce the spread of the virus,” said Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey in a statement. Piercey added that the plan will likely be modified as the state learns when and how many vaccines will be received. Tennessee is expected to get 2% of the national vaccine allocation, but the exact number is unknown. Under the draft plan, Tennessee will distribute the majority of the vaccines throughout its 95 counties based on population. Ten percent of the vaccines will be set aside as a reserve stash.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The second coronavirus wave in Texas continued with more active cases than at any time since the summertime peak, according to numbers state health officials reported Wednesday. An estimated 84,538 cases of COVID-19, the illness the coronavirus causes, were active Wednesday, the Department of State Health Services reported. That was the most since Sept. 1. Of those, 4,782 cases required hospitalization, the most since Aug. 26. The 4,991 new cases, along with 261 unreported cases from earlier, increased the Texas total for the eight-month outbreak to 838,809 cases. The Texas COVID-19 death toll of 114 Wednesday raised the outbreak toll to 17,201.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The Southwest Utah Public Health Department reported 81 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, with six more people hospitalized. In a news conference organized by local health care officials, Patrick Carroll, medical director at Dixie Regional Medical Center, again urged local residents to wear masks, noting that he regularly sees locals disregard recommendations for mask-wearing and social distancing. \"It's important to understand that the problems that we're seeing with COVID are not a problem specific to Salt Lake or Utah County, that these are problems that we're seeing in St. George and Southwest Utah as well,\" said Intermountain Dixie Regional Medical Director Patrick Carroll during a Wednesday news conference. \"Right now, we're trending in the wrong direction.\" Statewide, the spike in new cases roughly coincides with school-age people going back to class, but Carroll said the spread hasn't been happening inside the classroom. Carroll said there had been relatively few cases involving public school students, praising Washington County School District for its handling of COVID-19 safety measures for K-12 schools. He said there has been virtually no student-to-student transmission within schools. \"Our kids are being an example for us adults and we need to follow their example,\" he said. \"They've shown us that they can do hard things.\" The vast majority of transmission locally is happening among friends and family, with cases being traced to either inside the home or to social gatherings where people frequently forego masks and stay in close contact with each other, Carroll said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Less than half of an $8 million COVID-19 pandemic relief program for people and small businesses behind on their utility bills has been used, and the state is encouraging those eligible to apply. The Vermont COVID-19 Arrearage Assistance Program can help with past-due bills to keep the lights on, water flowing, and heat running as winter approaches. “We only have six weeks left to essentially spend the full $8 million,” Riley Allen, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service told MyChamplainValley.com on Wednesday. “We’re trying to make adjustments to the program to market further, allow the money to flow more freely.” Allen estimated that the total amount of unpaid bills in the state is much larger than what has been awarded. Allen said the money has to be spent by Nov. 30. Now previous recipients are eligible to receive additional funding.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria:Leesburg resident Didier Kindambu, 48, was arrested this week and charged with fraudulently obtaining $2,501,753 in loans through the federal CARES Act, buying a Cessna airplane and other luxury items with the federally funded money, WUSA-TV reported, according to the federal government. Kindambu made his first appearance in federal court on Tuesday. Prosecutors believe Kindambu carried out the scheme in connection with two businesses that he owns and created fraudulent payroll documentation for each business and then submitted that documentation in support of the loan applications, said government officials. Kindambu is charged with one count of bank fraud and faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison if convicted.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The State Department of Health released its draft plan to distribute vaccine doses in several phases, outlining for the first time who will have first access, how vaccines will be administered and how the state plans to promote the vaccine to its residents, The Seattle Times reported. Health officials submitted the plan to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last Friday and released it to the public on Wednesday. Officials said the plan recognizes the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on some communities and promises to take equity into consideration when allocating the doses. The state’s plan would first prioritize the vaccine to limited, high-risk workers in health care settings, first responders, other essential workers and adults in long-term care facilities. The state then plans to make the vaccine accessible in a “broad network of provider settings” such as pharmacies, community health centers and occupational health clinics. The third phase would address gaps in populations with inequitable access.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKeyser: Mineral County students who are part of in-school and at-home virtual learning are tentatively scheduled to return to in-person schooling for four days a week beginning Nov. 30. Students who are entirely virtual might be allowed to return to school at that time if certain conditions permit, but they will have the option at the beginning of the second semester in January.That is dependent upon the COVID-19 rates between now and then. Superintendent Troy Ravenscroft presented the reentry plan to the Mineral County Board of Education on Tuesday, touching off an approximately hour-long discussion that included many opinions and some passionate pleas. Ravenscroft said a rumor had been going around that the transition back into class would happen earlier, but there is still much work to do. “We need more time to make sure we’ve considered everything we should,” he said. Board member Donnie Ashby expressed disappointment that the reentry date had been pushed back. Ashby said he has heard from a lot of working parents who are having much difficulty keeping their children at home and helping them with their schooling.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Coronavirus cases among American Indians in Wisconsin have tripled since Sept. 1, far surpassing the growth rate among other races.

The orders included closing casinos, limiting access to some reservations, safer-at-home rules and curfews. Some limited or banned visitors to nursing homes. Some have delivered food and medical supplies to elders.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Department of Health on Wednesday reported 235 new coronavirus cases, inclduing 48 confirmed cases in Natrona County, the Casper Star-Tribune reported.
