And it’s stirring debate in liberal legal circles about the judicial approach the President should be seeking in his nominee. At its essence, the choice reduces to a single question: Should Biden pick a conciliatory “bridge-builder” or a confrontational “truth-teller”?\n\nGiven how often the President has stressed his desire to work with Republicans and unify the country, many liberal interest groups closely watching the process believe he will favor a nominee he can present as a bridge-builder who will seek consensus wherever possible on the court. Biden signaled that inclination during his remarks when Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. The President lauded him as “a model public servant in a time of great division in this country” and praised his outreach to justices across the ideological spectrum. Breyer, Biden declared, “patiently sought common ground and built consensus, seeking to bring the court together.”\n\nBut many legal observers, including key voices in the civil rights and civil liberties groups central to the Democratic coalition, are dubious there will be many opportunities on big issues to reach any agreement with the six-member Republican-appointed bloc, which has quickly demonstrated its determination to move the law sharply to the right on issues from voting rights to religious freedom and abortion. In that environment, many in these groups prefer what some call a “truth-teller” more in the mold of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who will write stinging dissents that both shape public opinion today and provide a road map for future Supreme Courts to overturn the conservative majority’s rulings.\n\n“I would say it appears unlikely that you are going to find someone who will serve as a bridge-builder, a Lewis Powell or for that matter a Sandra Day O’Connor,” says longtime civil rights strategist Wade Henderson, now the interim president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, referring to two earlier centrist GOP-appointed justices. “The divide [on the court] is now too pronounced to have someone knowingly stepping into that role. I would hope he looks for someone who is capable of speaking truth to power with an eloquence and a substantive knowledge of the law in a way that helps to lay, through their opinions, the ground for a reform of the court going forward.”\n\nThe first ‘great dissenters’\n\nThe prospect of spending years in the minority after joining the court might be somewhat daunting for whoever Biden selects. Yet through the court’s history, some justices who have endured years in such a precarious position have influenced the course of the law with powerful dissenting opinions. That’s the tradition that many advocates hope the President will look to as he makes his choice.\n\n“It’s a generational appointment,” says Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center. “It may be true that because of the current composition of the court that the [Democratic-appointed] justices find themselves too often in dissent. But we’ve also seen that the dissents of today can become the guiding principles of tomorrow.”\n\nThe tradition of justices known primarily for their dissents stretches back to John Marshall Harlan, who was appointed in 1877 by Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes. As author Peter Canellos observed in his 2021 biography, “The Great Dissenter,” “Before Harlan, dissenting opinions in Supreme Court cases were few and far between—strange and often unnoticed footnotes. Harlan turned the act of dissenting into something more significant: an appeal to the next generation of jurists. He spent thousands of hours holed up under gas lamps creating doctrines that would find their true light in the electric future.”\n\nServing for more than three decades on the deeply conservative court of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Harlan voted against a succession of rulings limiting government’s ability to regulate business or impose an income tax. But he’s best remembered as the sole dissenter on the landmark 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, which authorized “separate but equal” racial segregation. Harlan’s ringing denunciation of the decision, Canellos says, became “the bible” for civil rights lawyers like Thurgood Marshall, later a Supreme Court justice himself, through the 20th century, and ultimately was vindicated in the court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision invalidating segregation in the schools. “I think [Harlan] believed his dissents would be appreciated over time,” Canellos says. “I think he would envision the conversation we are having right now.”\n\nHarlan’s mantle was next seized through the early 20th century by Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis, who issued a procession of powerful dissents to another conservative majority court. Many of those were on cases in which the majority voted to strike down public regulation of business, but Holmes and Brandeis are remembered even more for their dissents asserting an expansive right to free speech. Brandeis’ dissents in particular anticipated a succession of landmark rulings under Chief Justice Earl Warren validating free speech rights during the 1960s – and have led legal historians to call Brandeis “the acknowledged master of the judicial dissent,” as one put it.\n\nUnderstandably, the President is seeking bipartisan support for his candidate, and certainly I would assume this is a very strategic decision on his part to set out a criteria of someone who, among other things, is a consensus builder. But I think perhaps at this moment in time, it’s simply wishful thinking that anyone can persuade the three Trump justices and others to move. Nan Aron, Georgetown University Law Center\n\nThurgood Marshall himself became a powerful dissenter, particularly on capital punishment and civil rights cases, after the liberal Warren court he had joined in 1967 tipped to become a conservative majority only a few years later. “His passionate vision came through in his dissents and was so important, obviously not in changing the results, but in educating the American public about the high stakes involved in Supreme Court decisions,” says Nan Aron, the recently retired founder and president of the Alliance for Justice, a leading liberal judicial advocacy group. “Decades of law students, decades of students studying civics, have read his dissents.”\n\nMore recently, two justices may have most clearly stepped into this tradition. On the right, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, though serving on conservative-majority courts, issued impassioned dissents on issues from abortion to same-sex marriage to federal regulation on the occasions when some Republican-appointed justices allied with Democratic appointees to generate more liberal decisions; those dissents have inspired the younger generation of conservative GOP appointees now pursuing more fundamental challenges to liberal precedents on all those fronts.\n\nDemocrats see Sotomayor as the modern exemplar of a “truth-teller” on the court. Particularly on the cases involving Texas and Mississippi laws retrenching the right to abortion, she has been withering in her denunciations of the majority’s decisions. She’s warned in oral arguments that overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade will create a “stench” around the court, and, in a written dissent, decried the majority’s refusal to block the Texas law allowing citizens to sue anyone involved in providing an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. The court’s refusal to end the “madness” of the Texas law, she wrote, “betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government.”\n\nDeploying to a war zone\n\nNot everyone in liberal legal circles believes Biden must tilt his choice toward someone in this dissenting tradition. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Berkeley Law School, told me in an email that Biden needs to take a very long view in the selection. “Of course … the new justice is likely to be in the bottom of a lopsided minority for the next decade or even two,” he wrote. “But Biden should be picking the Justice the Democrats will want there in 2040 and 2050. It should be a strong progressive who will articulate a progressive vision, even if in dissent. Ideally, too, it will be someone who might put together coalitions for progressive results.”\n\nStill, among liberal-leaning legal analysts, there’s a widespread consensus that the opportunity for such coalition building will be exceedingly rare for many years. Several I spoke with argued that the nominee Biden needs for a court with a lopsided 6-3 conservative majority is different from what he might select for a narrow 5-4 split in which Chief Justice John Roberts represented an occasionally persuadable swing vote.\n\n“If there was a 5-4 court, Biden might want someone who is more moderate and who might negotiate with the chief [Roberts], but with this 6-3 court I don’t think there is much of an opportunity for reaching out,” says Paul Butler, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “Most of the conservative justices are hard-core right-wing ideologues, and people like [Clarence] Thomas and [Samuel] Alito have been waiting for this moment and this court for decades. So on issues like affirmative action and abortion they are not in a negotiating mood or posture.”\n\nTwo other characteristics of the six-member GOP-appointed majority may influence Biden’s thinking. One is its relative youth: Absent health issues, this same conservative bloc could dominate the court well into the 2030s, given that its oldest members (Thomas at 73 and Alito at 71) may serve for at least another decade. The other is its ambition and aggressiveness: Particularly in its handling of the Texas and Mississippi abortion cases, this majority has clearly signaled its willingness to tilt the law sharply to the right, even if that means overturning long-standing precedent. The GOP-appointed majority has shown that it will be “very aggressive on fundamental issues, not bound by precedent, and not bound by convention or practice,” says Deborah Archer, a professor at New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nTaken together, all of this has produced a consensus in liberal-leaning legal circles that Biden will be deploying his nominee into the legal equivalent of a war zone. And that consensus has coalesced into a dominant preference for him to pick a warrior – not in her personal relations with the other justices, but in her approach to the job.\n\n“Understandably, the President is seeking bipartisan support for his candidate, and certainly I would assume this is a very strategic decision on his part to set out a criteria of someone who, among other things, is a consensus builder,” says Aron, who now teaches law at Georgetown. “But I think perhaps at this moment in time, it’s simply wishful thinking that anyone can persuade the three Trump justices and others to move.”\n\nHenderson agrees. “One reason Sonia Sotomayor stands out … is her willingness to speak truthfully and forcefully as to what she sees is happening, and I think Justice Breyer’s replacement needs to be someone in that mold,” he told me.\n\nLikewise, Archer says that given the limited opportunity for agreement with the conservative majority, Biden should prioritize a justice who will sharpen the public debate “about race and inequality” and make clear “the true impact of the court’s decisions” as it rolls back previously accepted rights in arenas from abortion to affirmative action to voting.\n\nAssessing the short listers\n\nFor many of the analysts and advocates within Democratic legal circles, viewing Biden’s potential nominees on this spectrum from bridge-builder to truth-teller offers a revealing lens through which to assess his options.\n\nTwo of Biden’s potential picks are cited most often as coming closest to the Breyer model of focusing primarily on building internal coalitions and trying to sand down the sharpest edges of the conservative majority’s decisions. Those potential nominees are California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and federal district Judge J. Michelle Childs, who is being promoted by close Biden ally Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. Though each draws praise for her qualifications, many civil rights and civil liberties groups consider both too moderate, not only in ideology but also temperament, to directly confront the challenges the GOP-appointed majority is likely to present to liberal causes in the coming years.\n\nBoth on and off the record, a surprising number of those I spoke with cited the same name as the potential nominee who could prove the most dynamic dissenter and “truth-teller”: Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\n“From their records, Sherrilyn Ifill would be the best at writing passionate, erudite dissents that get talked about because people can understand them,” says Butler. “She’s got the skills in terms of messaging, a keen lawyerly grasp of the issues and she’s very charismatic.” The prospect of Ifill joining Sotomayor to dissent from the court’s conservative drift, he says, “would make the court more exciting for progressives … even if there are not enough votes to change the law in the short term.”\n\nThe consensus front-runner, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, may occupy a position somewhere near the midpoint on the axis from bridge-builder to truth-teller. As a former Breyer clerk, she’s not considered likely to confront the majority as directly as Ifill might, but, as a former public defender, neither is she perceived to be as restrained in her approach as, say, Kruger. Jackson’s starkly worded 2019 decision batting down an expansive claim of executive privilege from then-President Donald Trump – “Presidents are not kings,” she wrote – suggests that “we could potentially see that same fire in dissents” on the Supreme Court, notes Butler.\n\nWhoever Biden selects is virtually certain to face resistance from almost all Republicans. Carrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, told me conservatives will mobilize against any Biden selection they view as too liberal, regardless of how they balance conciliation and confrontation in their approach to the court. “At the end of the day the most important thing is how that person approaches the law, not what their personal style is,” she says. “The Democrat short listers are ones who are going to be uniform in the way they are going to vote on the court.”\n\nThe White House has signaled to allies that Biden’s decision will not be influenced by public signals from some Senate Republicans that they might be more receptive to Childs in particular than others. Yet many liberal legal analysts believe that Biden’s desire to win at least some Senate Republican support will discourage him from making any selection, like Ifill, seen as especially provocative to the GOP, or even to the most conservative Senate Democrats. (At 59, Ifill is also older than the other major alternatives.)\n\n“He is more inclined to pick someone who reflects the traditions of what court picks were at an earlier point in time, and he is comfortable with that,” the leader of one liberal legal group, who asked for anonymity to discuss their view of internal White House deliberations, told me. Jackson, who generally draws praise from the left but also won three GOP Senate votes for her confirmation to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, may occupy the sweet spot as well between a pick seen as either provoking or deferring to Republicans.\n\nIn a tenure that could last decades, whoever Biden picks isn’t likely to ever play only one role or even to remain static in how she balances the “bridge-building” and “truth-telling” roles.\n\n“I actually think that the nominee’s approach will be her own, and that is OK,” says Goss Graves. “She will not model herself after Breyer or Sotomayor or any other justice. Her approach and perspective will be one that is important and possibly new.”\n\nYet one thing is guaranteed: With a staunchly conservative majority likely to retain control of the court for years, whoever Biden selects will need to take a long view of her potential influence on American life. The best compass for Biden’s choice may be the words of Benjamin Cardozo, a celebrated New York state judge who later served in the minority of a conservative-dominated Supreme Court during the 1930s. “The voice of the majority may be that of force triumphant, content with the plaudits of the hour,” he once declared. “The dissenter speaks to the future, and his voice is pitched to a key that will carry through the years.”", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/25/new-orleans-revelry-overwhelming-stink-right-food-news-around-states/119081162/", "title": "New Orleans revelry, overwhelming stink: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Plagued by a shortage of stadium workers and complaints about long concession lines at home football games during the pandemic, the University of Alabama has contracted with an online app. It also made other changes in hopes of speeding up service during Saturday’s homecoming game against Tennessee. With a capacity crowd of more than 101,000 expected, Alabama said fans could use the Waitr phone system to order food and drinks in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Fans using the system are notified when an order is ready and can then pick up items at windows in the stadium. The Alabama deal is Waitr’s first for a football stadium, although baseball fans have used the app in Louisiana and Mississippi, company spokesman Dean Turcol said. Alabama received complaints about long concession lines after its home game against the University of Mississippi on Oct. 2. Athletics director Greg Byrne said part of the problem was the difficulty finding workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Similar to staffing issues at the gates, an average of 40% of people who were supposed to work concessions on game days end up not showing up leaving them short-handed,” he wrote in a weekly email to supporters at the time. The athletic department said it is also streamlining menus and adding ordering technology to speed up sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman known for 37 years only as Horseshoe Harriet, one of a dozen or so victims of a notorious Alaska serial killer, has been identified through genetic genealogy and a DNA match, authorities said Friday. The victim was identified Friday as Robin Pelkey, who was 19 and living on the streets of Anchorage when she was killed by Robert Hansen in the early 1980s, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation’s Cold Case Investigation Unit said. “I would like to thank all of the troopers, investigators, and analysts that have diligently worked on this case over the last 37 years. Without their hard work and tenacity, the identity of Ms. Pelkey may have never been known,” Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner James Cockrell said in a statement. Hansen, who owned a bakery, gained the nickname “Butcher Baker” for abducting and hunting down women – many of them sex workers – in the wilderness just north of Anchorage through the early 1980s, when the state’s largest city was booming because of construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Construction of the 800-mile pipeline offered well-paying jobs for workers, but it also attracted those looking for fast money and left as quickly as they came. Exotic dancers traveled a circuit along West Coast cities, making sudden disappearances commonplace.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney for members of the San Carlos Apache tribe on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to back a nonprofit group’s efforts to keep a copper mining company from gaining federal Arizona land that the Apaches consider sacred. “We are talking about the survival of the Apache people,” attorney Luke Goodrich told the panel, arguing that an end to religious activities on the land known as Oak Flat would help spell an end to the tribe. Joan Pepin, an attorney for the U.S. government, argued the land transfer must go ahead because it was part of legislation approved by Congress. The land has been set to be transferred to Resolution Copper, as part of a provision in a must-pass 2014 defense bill, once the final environmental impact statement is published. The three-member panel did not immediately release a ruling. The judges will now confer in private and write a decision that may not be issued for as long as three months. Goodrich said the group could take the case to the Supreme Court if the appeals court sides with the U.S. Forest Service, the agency that has planned the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit organization representing tribe members, sued the federal government in Phoenix federal court in January to block the pending transfer of the land near the community of Superior.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A prison transport driver convicted last year of sexually assaulting two female inmates was sentenced Thursday to life in prison plus five years. U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall handed down the sentence to Eric Scott Kindley, 53, for the assaults and knowingly possessing a firearm to further a violent crime. Kindley sexually assaulted the women in 2014 and 2017 while transporting them between lockups on warrants. Kindley operated his own private prisoner transport company that contracted with local jails throughout the country to transport individuals arrested on out-of-state warrants. The federal investigation into Kindley began when two women, housed together at a small jail in Arizona, reported that he sexually assaulted them during two separate trips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Levels of wretched-smelling hydrogen sulfide gas that have plagued south Los Angeles County communities for weeks are declining as authorities use various mitigation methods in a flood control channel emitting the gross odors, authorities said Friday in an online news conference. The problem was reported Oct. 7 and traced to the 15-mile-long Dominguez Channel, which flows into the Los Angeles harbor. The smell has chiefly affected the city of Carson and several other Los Angeles suburbs. The gas is being created by a natural phenomenon called anaerobic digestion, which occurs when bacteria break down vegetation when there’s a lack of oxygen in the water, said Mark Pestrella, the county’s public works director and chief engineer of the flood control district. In addition, the investigation revealed the presence of chemicals that are contributing to the problem. Pestrella did not identify those chemicals and said he could not comment further because it may involve criminal or civil actions. Public works is spraying the channel with a biodegradable odor neutralizer called Epoleon, which converts hydrogen sulfide to a salt. Daily tides are being relied on to spread the neutralizer, and Pestrella said drones are being considered to help that process. A system of bubblers is being installed in the channel to oxygenate the water, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A day care owner convicted of keeping 26 children hidden in the basement of her business two years ago has been sentenced to six years in prison after parents said some of the children still suffer trauma including sleeping problems and anxiety. A judge issued the sentence to Carla Faith on Thursday following her August conviction of more than two dozen misdemeanor child abuse charges and other crimes. Faith was only licensed to care for up to six children at her private day care, and only two were allowed to be under age 2. But police who went to her Mountain Play Place day care in November 2019 found 25 kids in the basement, including 12 under 2 years old, prosecutors said. There were two adult employees supervising them in the basement, and one accepted a plea deal and testified at Faith’s trial, KRDO-TV reports. A 26th child was picked up by a parent while police were on site, authorities said. Many of the children had soiled or wet diapers and were sweaty and thirsty, according to an arrest affidavit. When police arrived, Faith repeatedly told an officer that no children were there and that the home did not have a basement, but the officer heard children’s music and a child’s cry from the basement, the affidavit said. Another officer discovered a false wall and moved it to reveal the basement staircase, the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Employees in the state’s prison system make up more than 32% of state workers who have failed to comply with Gov. Ned Lamont’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to figures released Friday by the governor’s office. Of Connecticut’s 30,623 state workers 1,482 – about 5% – have not been vaccinated or submitted to weekly coronavirus testing as required by the mandate, according to the report. Those include 483 workers at the state Department of Correction, which has about 5,400 employees. The governor’s office had given workers until Oct. 4 to comply with the order. But the state has so far fired just 22 workers and placed an additional 29 on unpaid leave. Officials are in the process of suspending or terminating an additional 70 workers, the governor’s office said. “The majority of employees who are currently out of compliance are working with the state to come into compliance and anticipate coming into compliance in the coming days,” Lamont spokesperson David Bednarz said. The department confirmed Friday that it has seen a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in several prisons, including the Hartford Correctional Center, the New Haven Correctional Center and the Carl Robinson Correctional Center. Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said most of those are asymptomatic cases among inmates.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Nearly every beach town along the state’s coast made more money from parking permits and meters this past summer than in 2020, and most also beat pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. In Lewes, the total parking revenue in 2021, including fees collected from parking tickets, reached just over $1 million – a 17% increase from 2019 and about a 27% jump from 2020. In Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach, this summer’s total parking revenues increased by just over 20% each compared to summer 2019. Their recovery from 2020 revenue was even greater. Dewey Beach’s accounting clerk clarified that the collections from parking fines during a given year may not perfectly reflect how many tickets were issued that year. But even without the revenue from parking citations, Dewey made a huge comeback: Revenue from parking permits and meters alone increased by about a third since 2019. Even as crowds returned to the boardwalks and beaches, though, some signs of the pandemic remained. Rehoboth Beach, for example, maintained its Meterless Mondays – free parking from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. every Monday – and several parking spots were taken up by outdoor dining and reserved spaces for carryout orders. Even so, Rehoboth Beach only fell below its pre-pandemic revenue by $80,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Area commuters will face longer waits for Metro trains through at least the end of the month and probably longer, as more than half the fleet of train cars will remain out of service over safety issues. Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld told reporters Friday that there was no timeline for the return of the transit authority’s 7000-series train cars, which were abruptly pulled from service last week after a derailing revealed a chronic problem with the wheels and axles. Those 748 cars are the newest and constitute more than 60% of the fleet. The derailing is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and Wiedefeld said he couldn’t comment on it while the investigation was ongoing. In the meantime, Wiedefeld said Metro engineers were working to bring older retired cars back into service. But he said the older cars were undergoing rigorous inspections, and he didn’t expect them back in service until early November. Until then, riders can expect longer delays between trains across the system, whose six lines crisscross the city and stretch deep into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The transit authority currently has 268 rail cars in service. There are 180 cars from the older 6000-series trains that may be brought back if they pass inspections. Currently only 22 of them are available for service.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed. Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson, a Republican, sent a memo to senators Saturday regarding the incident at the office of Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions. Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, had not yet made public her breast cancer diagnosis. Polsky told the Associated Press about the tense exchange with state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo that was first reported by news site Florida Politics. She said Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and were asked to wear them when they arrived for the Wednesday meeting. She did not tell him she had breast cancer but said she had a serious condition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity to vaccines. Ladapo had asked to meet her in Tallahassee as he seeks confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month. Polsky said she asked whether there was a reason why he couldn’t wear a mask, but he wouldn’t answer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge is throwing out ethics charges against former Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, saying state officials waited too long to pursue action. Oxendine was accused of illegally using campaign funds from his failed 2010 gubernatorial campaign to buy a house and lease cars. He was also accused of accepting campaign contributions 10 times above the legal limit from insurance companies. Local news outlets report administrative law judge Ronit Walker ruled last week that the statute of limitations on misconduct had passed when ethics officials began to pursue Oxendine in 2015. Walker also ruled that the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission can’t pursue Oxendine for accepting $120,000 in bundled contributions from two insurance companies. “No matter how patently obvious it may be that corporations are ‘affiliated,’ the legislature has chosen only to penalize the donor,” Walker wrote in dismissing the illegal contributions case against Oxendine, citing state law. The ethics complaint against the insurers was dismissed in 2014 because commission staff had made little progress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2016 that Oxendine kept $500,000 in leftover funds from his gubernatorial campaign and kept contributions for a runoff and general election he never saw.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The number of students enrolled at the University of Hawaii’s 10 campuses increased this fall for the first time in a decade. The school’s flagship Manoa campus led the way with a 6% increase, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The university’s first-year class is its largest ever. Overall, the institution’s enrollment is the highest it’s been since 2014. Enrollment at the Hilo campus is up 2.5%. Leeward Community College and Windward Community College posted gains of 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Overall enrollment at UH’s seven community colleges, however, is down 3.2%. Manoa enrollment, officials said, was up in nearly every category, including resident, continental U.S, transfer and international students. UH-Manoa Provost Michael Bruno credited the university for spreading the word about the benefits of a Manoa education. The perception that Hawaii and the Manoa campus in particular have managed the coronavirus pandemic better than most places may have played a role, he said. Hawaii Pacific University had been expecting an enrollment boost before the fall semester began. It was expecting to have 4,000 students this fall, its most ever. Its first-year class was expected to climb from about 500 to more than 800.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: The city is asking a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit brought by an anti-mask group, arguing the group’s members can’t show they’ve actually been harmed by a local face-covering mandate. Hailey and other central Idaho towns surrounding the popular Sun Valley ski resort were at the epicenter of the state’s first major coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. The city enacted its mask mandate – requiring most people to wear masks in public when indoors or outside when social distancing is impossible – in July 2020, and a version of the order has remained in place ever since. Idaho remains one of the least-vaccinated states in the nation, and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have overwhelmed hospitals. A month ago, state public health leaders enacted “crisis standards of care,” allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed to deal with the flood of patients. About a week after the state entered crisis standards of care, an anti-mask organization based hundreds of miles away in the northern Idaho city of Sandpoint sued Hailey on behalf of its members who live in and near the central Idaho town. In the lawsuit, the group said the mask mandate amounted to a “mandatory human experiment” that violates their fundamental human rights.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The mayor has helped launch the installation of new signs renaming the city’s picturesque Lake Shore Drive after a Black man recognized as a key settler of the city. Mayor Lori Lightfoot gathered Thursday with political and community leaders at Buckingham Fountain to kick off the installation of 12 large highway signs declaring the thoroughfare “Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive.” More than 80 smaller street signs that will mark the roadway along the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline read simply: “DuSable Lake Shore Drive,” the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Lightfoot, who had initially opposed renaming Lake Shore Drive, said the $500,000 cost is “worth it” to honor a man who was “forgotten in the annals” of Chicago history. “We needed to find a way to honor our founder,” Lightfoot said. Chicago’s City Council approved the name change in June. DuSable, a native of Haiti, is considered Chicago’s first permanent, non-Indigenous settler. He had a successful trading post in the late 1700s. He died in 1818. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city four years later. Alderman Donald Moore initially proposed changing the name of the ribbon of concrete along Lake Michigan to DuSable Drive two years ago after a riverboat tour of the city in which he said DuSable’s name wasn’t mentioned.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Twitter suspended a congressman’s official account after removing a post about a transgender woman over violation of the social media company’s rules. Twitter’s action Saturday came after Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Banks posted tweets last week regarding Dr. Rachel Levine becoming the first openly transgender four-star officer in the U.S. uniformed services. Banks had responded to the U.S. surgeon general congratulating Levine on her promotion in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by writing: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man.” Now-retired Army Gen. Ann Dunwoody was the first woman in the U.S. military to attain a four-star rank. Banks’ post was removed with a reference to Twitter rules that include a ban on “targeted misgendering” of transgender people. Banks’ official Twitter account remained online Sunday, but he wasn’t allowed to add new posts. His personal account with fewer followers remained active. Banks, whose district covers Fort Wayne and surrounding northeastern Indiana, has frequently drawn attention with right-wing social media comments. He stood by his post about Levine. “My tweet was a statement of fact,” Banks said in a statement. “Big Tech doesn’t have to agree with me, but they shouldn’t be able to cancel me.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Doctors accused of doing something dangerous or inappropriate could keep the allegations private until a regulatory board makes a final determination and issues a report under a state Supreme Court decision issued Friday. In its unanimous decision, the court said the Iowa Board of Medicine should not have publicly disclosed information about a doctor under investigation, as was standard for the agency. Its ruling likely will lead to changes in how dozens of other boards handle complaints. “Read in its entirety, we do not believe the statute is ambiguous. Investigative information cannot be released to the public prior to a final decision in a disciplinary proceeding,” Justice Edward Mansfield wrote. Iowa Freedom of Information Council Executive Director Randy Evans called the decision disappointing and said he hopes the Legislature revises the statute. “Those facts and circumstances need full and timely disclosure to patients and consumers so they can make an informed selection of a treating physician,” he said. The court ruled in the case of Dr. Domenico Calcaterra, a cardiothoracic surgeon who formerly practiced in Iowa City but now practices in another state. He has long denied allegations of disruptive behavior and unethical or unprofessional misconduct.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Overland Park Police Department plans to expand its team that responds to calls involving mental health crises, with a goal of defusing the situations while keeping everyone safe. The new Overland Park Crisis Action Team will have 12 members and six co-responders, though most of the positions haven’t started yet. Currently, it has two crisis intervention specialists and three co-responders, The Kansas City Star reports. When the team responds to a mental health call, it will be accompanied by a clinician from Johnson County Mental Health. A therapy dog will also join the team. “Our whole goal is to bring them in and let them do their job, and (officers are) there to make sure everybody’s safe,” said police Sgt. Stewart Brought. In September, the Overland Park City Council raised property taxes to create the expanded unit. OPCAT also received a nearly $250,000 grant from the Department of Justice. “This OPCAT unit, it will save lives,” said Sheila Albers, who has fought for police reforms since her 17-year-old son, John Albers, was killed by an Overland Park officer during a welfare check in January 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Striking workers at one of the world’s largest bourbon producers voted to ratify a new contract Saturday, a day after announcing a tentative agreement with Heaven Hill. About 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D went on strike about six weeks ago, forming picket lines at the company’s operations in Bardstown after rejecting a previous contract proposal. The tentative agreement came just days after the company signaled it intended to start hiring permanent replacement employees for bottling and warehouse operations. The workers then voted to ratify the five-year agreement Saturday, according to a statement from Heaven Hill. “We look forward to welcoming our team members as we transition back to normal operations,” company spokesperson Josh Hafer said in the statement. The dispute revolved around health care and scheduling, the latter a sign of the bourbon industry’s growing pains as it tries to keep up with global demand. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons. The spirits company’s other brands include Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The high school bands played, the costumed marching groups danced, and float riders threw Moon Pies and beads to the thousands of people who turned out Saturday for the city’s first big parade since the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic put the brakes on New Orleans’ signature brand of frivolity. The streets were lined with thousands of residents and tourists who came to watch the Krewe of Boo parade – the first float parade since Mardi Gras 2020. The Halloween-themed parade stretches from the city’s Marigny neighborhood through the French Quarter and into the Warehouse District. Riders on the floats dress up in Halloween-themed outfits and throw ghoulish and fun trinkets and beads to crowds that pack the streets. “This is one of the best feelings in a very long time,” said Jordan Philebar, a New Orleans resident who was dressed as Wednesday Addams from “The Addams Family” as she rode a float along with four members of her family. “It’s lovely to feel slightly normal again.” Mardi Gras 2020 was largely credited with contributing to the city becoming an early hot spot for the coronavirus. As the extent and seriousness of the pandemic became apparent, parades and music festivals were canceled.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed “right to food” constitutional amendment is on the ballot for the state’s voters in the Nov. 2 election. Some say it would simply put people in charge of how and what they eat, while others worry it would endanger animals and food supplies and turn urban neighborhoods into cattle pastures. For supporters, the language is short and to the point, ensuring the right to grow vegetables and raise livestock in an era when corporatization threatens local ownership of the food supply – a constitutional experiment that has never been tried in any state. For opponents and skeptics, it’s deceptively vague, representing a threat to food safety and animal welfare, and could embolden residents to raise cows in their backyards in cities like Portland and Bangor. Voters will be asked if they favor an amendment to the Maine Constitution “to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” The proposal is an outgrowth of the right-to-food movement, sometimes called the food sovereignty movement. Maine enacted the nation’s first food sovereignty law in 2017, allowing local governments to OK small food producers selling directly to customers on site. The law was especially popular with sellers of raw milk, which can be legally sold in Maine but is more restricted in many other states.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has disbarred retired Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly for withholding exculpatory evidence that surfaced in a 1981 double-murder case and lying about it over the years. The Baltimore Sun reports Cassilly learned of the court’s decision Friday in a phone call from the newspaper. “Oh, whatever. I’m retired anyway,” he reportedly told the Sun. The Maryland Court of Appeals found the former prosecutor lied about documents that undermined the credibility of an FBI agent on the case. The judges noted Cassilly, a Republican, served 36 years as Harford County’s top prosecutor and retired in 2019. The judges wrote that disbarring him would prevent his possible return to the courtroom and send a message. Cassilly maintains that he did nothing wrong but rather “fell into the whole anti-criminal justice movement, where the cops are the bad guys and the prosecutors are the bad guys.” “I’m disappointed, but the real answer is: Do I care? I don’t give a damn,” he said. “I wouldn’t do anything to engage in the practice of law right now because it’s such a screwed-up obscenity.” John Norman Huffington, who was released from prison in 2008 after serving 27 years of a life sentence, has said he would have won his freedom years earlier had Cassilly disclosed key records.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are considering whether to begin allowing electric bicycles in bike lanes. Currently, electric bikes are prohibited on bike paths because they’re categorized as mopeds, though advocates for bicyclists say the law is largely unenforced. The Boston Globe reports some state lawmakers are now pushing a bill to bring Massachusetts in line with 46 other states and Washington, D.C., in regulating electric bikes as bikes. “What’s abundantly clear, whatever the law, is people are riding e-bikes in bike lanes and bike paths, as they should – they are bikes,” said state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, D-Democrat, who is sponsoring the bill in the House. A similar bill is pending in the state Senate. The House chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, however, questioned whether it’s safe to allow bikes traveling at 20 mph or more on the paths. “These are pretty fast speeds,” said Rep. William Straus, D-Mattapoisett. “I want to be really cautious in terms of the safety issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nHamtramck: Another Michigan city is giving filters to residents as a result of high lead results in some drinking water samples. Hamtramck, in the Detroit area, is a 2-square-mile city with 28,000 residents, many of them immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and other countries. Seven hundred filters were passed out Thursday, and another 900 will be distributed this week, said City Manager Kathleen Angerer. “The water itself is fine. The issue is the outdated lead services lines that in some cases are leaching lead into the water into individual homes,” Mayor Karen Majewski said. She said not every home is affected. “People don’t need to panic,” Angerer said. LaTonya Hatcher, 49, was in line Thursday. “I want to get a filter for the sink,” she said. “I live in a newer neighborhood, and the pipes might be fine, but I was walking by and saw they were giving out filters, so I thought I should ask if I need one.” Across the state in Benton Harbor, residents have been urged to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking due to elevated lead levels. The problem in both communities, according to officials, is old lines that need to be replaced. Majewski said Hamtramck has replaced 260 lead lines over the past year but needs money to remove more.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Native Americans have contracted COVID-19 at two to three times the rate of white Minnesotans over the past month, according to state health officials. There are large pockets of unvaccinated people in the 18-to-49 age range in Minnesota’s tribal communities and across the country, according to Mary Owen, director of the Center for American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota medical school. “We have some folks who are not getting vaccinated, whether it’s because they’re resisting it or because they’re not able to get access. Not quite sure. It’s probably a combination of those. But that’s impacting us again, significantly,” said Owen, who is also president of the Association of American Indian Physicians. Owen said that’s especially concerning because Native Americans have high rates of health disparities, such as diabetes, that put them at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “We have some very frail people in our communities that cannot afford to get infected. We have to protect them,” Owen said. “So please, do what’s right for our communities, not just for us as individuals.” The Leech Lake reservation has recorded its highest numbers of positive COVID-19 cases over the past month since the pandemic began.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prison employees will conduct once-a-week rehearsals as the state prepares for its first execution since 2012, according to Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain. He said Friday that the rehearsals for a lethal injection are usually done once a month at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, following a protocol that’s about 20 pages long. “Very, very detailed,” Cain said. The Mississippi Supreme on Thursday set a Nov. 17 execution date for David Neal Cox, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to killing his wife, Kim, in 2010 in the northern Mississippi town of Shannon. Cox withdrew his appeals and once filed court papers calling himself “worthy of death.” Mississippi has not had an execution since 2012, and it had six that year. Cain confirmed Mississippi has obtained lethal injection drugs, but he declined to say how. “I’m not supposed to talk about the drugs too much,” Cain said. Mississippi is still facing a lawsuit filed in 2015 by the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center on behalf of two inmates. The suit argues Mississippi’s lethal injection protocol is inhumane.\n\nMissouri\n\nBates City: A small-town mayor resigned ahead of a scheduled impeachment hearing called after he was allegedly recorded uttering a racial slur. Shawn Fox offered his resignation last Monday to the Bates City Board of Aldermen, ahead of an impeachment hearing scheduled Wednesday, television station WDAF reports. Instead of the hearing, the board accepted Fox’s resignation Wednesday. Mayor Pro-Tem Roy Trussell said Fox’s resignation came after the city had concluded its investigation, which included a leaked recording of someone believed to be Fox uttering a racial slur, as well as allegations of sexual harassment. It was unclear when or where the recording was made or who had leaked it. Fox’s resignation was the latest in a recent exodus of city government officials amid mounting allegations of a hostile work environment. Alderman Donnie Hammond resigned Tuesday, and the city’s collector and a court clerk both recently stepped down. Bates City is a town of nearly 220 about 28 miles east of Kansas City.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation honored Chief Earl Old Person with a weeklong memorial, ending with a funeral service Friday in the Browning High School gym. The gym smelled of sage, many women wore ribbon skirts, and some men wore headdresses as they remembered the life of Old Person, who was the tribe’s chief for 43 years. He died of cancer Oct. 13 in Browning. He was 92. Hundreds of people gathered in the gym as Old Person was remembered for his tireless advocacy for Native Americans and their culture, his strength of character, and his humility. He served on the tribal council for more than 60 years and was chairman of the tribal business council for over 50 years. He traveled the world, meeting Queen Elizabeth, the shah of Iran, and every U.S. president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama in advocating for the Blackfeet Tribe. He also worked to preserve the Blackfeet language, songs and culture. But tribal members remember his constant presence on the reservation and his care and concern for the Blackfeet people. He would attend basketball games, community events and graduations. He served as a mentor and even a father figure to tribal members. “We’re putting one of our last chiefs to rest,” Jay St. Goddard said. “It’s not just a private event; it’s not just a Montana event – this is a national event.”\n\nNebraska\n\nSuperior: An employee who returned fire after a gunman killed two people at a grain elevator likely prevented more deaths, a Nebraska State Patrol official said Friday. The employee, who was not named, retrieved a weapon and shot Max Hoskinson, 61, after Hoskinson began shooting at the Agrex Elevator in Superior on Thursday. Hoskinson, of Superior, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities said he had been fired earlier Thursday and returned that afternoon with a gun and began shooting in an office area. The victims were identified as Sandra Nelson, 60, of Formoso, Kansas, and 53-year-old Darin Koepke, of Hadar, Nebraska. The third person shot by Hoskinson was treated at a hospital and released. Patrol Sgt. Jeff Roby said during the news conference that authorities do not anticipate filing any charges against the employee who shot Hoskinson. “In fact, it’s likely that the employee’s actions may have prevented much further loss of life in this tragedy,” Roby said. He said he could not comment on whether Hoskinson targeted the victims, who were all Agrex employees. He said several other employees were on site when the shooting occurred.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Lawmakers have decided motorists who want refunds of a $1-per-transaction surcharge that courts decided was unconstitutionally authorized in 2020 will have to go in person to state Department of Motor Vehicles offices. The Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee signed off Thursday on the refund program, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The move aims to comply with a Nevada Supreme Court ruling last May that said the surcharge was unconstitutionally authorized by the Legislature because the state constitution requires revenue measures to be approved by two-thirds majorities in both chambers. Senate Republicans opposed extending the DMV fee along with a tax on businesses in 2019 and filed suit after Democrats approved them. The DMV said it was collecting about $7 million per year from the fee but would provide refunds after the court ruling. The Review-Journal reports five other refund options were dismissed as more complex and costly than the amount collected, including mailing checks to all DMV customers. The rule that lawmakers adopted says people will have to present receipts in person at a DMV office for refunds. Business customers, with a larger volume of transactions, can receive checks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislative committee on Friday approved a proposal from the state Department of Health and Human Services to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The last-minute proposal from Gov. Chris Sununu and Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette came last week after she withdrew the requests for the acceptance of $27 million in federal COVID-19 vaccination funding that was rejected by the Executive Council the week prior. Approval for the $27 million was needed by both the council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which tabled the funds last month. Republican members expressed deep concern that accepting the funds would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19, including “quarantine and isolation.” Attorney General John Formella said that wasn’t the case. Sununu thanked the committee for its vote, saying that “we are committed to finding alternative sources of funds to ensure our vaccine distribution can move full steam ahead, and today’s vote allows us to do so.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Bucking a practice used by most law enforcement agencies in the state, the Newark Police Department, New Jersey’s largest municipal force, will stop posting the mug shots of people arrested for minor offenses. The city’s public safety department announced the change in a Facebook post Wednesday. The reason, public safety director Brian O’Hara said, is to help “safeguard individuals from marginalized communities from abuse.” In the post, O’Hara cited a spike in negative comments on a 2017 social media post regarding a prostitution arrest. “The incendiary comments fundamentally indicate that members of marginalized communities – including the transgender community – can become targets of cyber-bullying, which can lead to hate crimes and violence, simply because their photos were published online,” O’Hara said. After the spike in comments, he had the post taken down and changed the department’s policy on mug shots. From now on, the department will only publish mug shots that serve “a specific law enforcement purpose, such as locating a wanted or missing person.” Publishing mug shots can have detrimental consequences to people arrested, said Sarah E. Lageson, an associate professor at the Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice who has a doctorate in sociology.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal water managers warned Wednesday that like other basins across the western U.S., the Pecos River Basin is likely to experience growing water shortages as temperatures continue to rise over the next century. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation discussed the findings of a recently completed study on the basin during a virtual briefing, saying the goal of the work was to better understand the threats to water supplies in the region due to climate change. Officials also looked at what tools could be used to stretch resources to help sustain viable agriculture over the coming century as challenges grow. Reclamation Study Manager Dagmar Llewellyn said those challenges are significant. She described the Pecos basin as arid with a limited and highly variable water supply. “Drought and climate change-induced aridification is ongoing already in the basin,” she said. “We’ve been seeing less snowfall in the headwaters and more winter precipitation falling as rain. We’ve also been seeing higher consumption rates within the agricultural system.” The peak flow of snowmelt runoff into Santa Rosa Reservoir, located at the top of the system, amounted to only a trickle of about 5 cubic feet per second this year. Total volume during the runoff period was about 700 acre-feet, or 56 times less than the historical average. That meant less water for downstream users.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and two other U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill in the House on Friday to put immigrants who cleared debris after the Sept. 11 attacks on a fast track to legal immigration status in the United States. The 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act is a revised version of a bill that former Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York introduced in 2017 that did not advance in the House. Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley in a 2018 Democratic primary, winning the seat representing parts of the Bronx and Queens. Immigrants in New York, many of whom are Spanish-speaking cleanup workers, have long asked to obtain legal immigration status in the U.S. as compensation for their work and the subsequent health problems they suffered after the attacks. Hired informally by cleaning companies, the workers cleared debris, asbestos and dust inside lower Manhattan buildings for months without adequate protective gear. But 20 years after 9/11, only several dozen are still participating in protests and making the request, while others have abandoned that fight. Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Rep. Grace Meng, both from New York, are lead co-sponsors of the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The soon-to-be successor to a state House member who died this month said Friday that he was outside the U.S. Capitol in January as an insurrection occurred. Donnie Loftis, who was chosen by Gaston County Republican activists last week to succeed the late Rep. Dana Bumgardner, confirmed his attendance at the Jan. 6 event to WRAL-TV. Loftis, a former Gaston County commissioner, said his involvement in what turned into a riot was strictly peaceful. On Jan. 6, “while I peacefully exercised my first amendment rights in front of the US Capitol, I was surprised and disappointed to watch others storm the entrance as violence ensued,” he wrote by text message to the station. “I had absolutely zero involvement in the rioting and categorically condemn the storming of our Capitol building that day.” Hundreds of Donald Trump’s supporters battered their way past police, injured dozens of officers and interrupted the electoral count inside the Capitol certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. In January, Loftis had posted a picture of himself to Facebook before the rally saying he was on a bus headed to Washington, according to WRAL. “I got gassed three times and was at the entrance when they breached the door,” Loftis, an Army veteran, posted at the time, according to a screenshot. “I spoke to many service members, and we all agreed that we didn’t want to be there, but we had no other choice. They don’t get it that they work for us. And I mean that in a respectful way.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is working to extend its contract with Hollywood actor Josh Duhamel to promote tourism in his home state. The top tourism official in one of the least-visited states in the nation said the 48-year-old star of several “Transformers” movies has been effective in attracting visitors to North Dakota, better known for its brutal cold weather than as a vacation destination. “He has helped expand our image and awareness of our state,” said Sara Otte Coleman, who heads the state’s tourism agency. Duhamel, a native of Minot, has been the face of North Dakota and its pitchman since 2013. He has been paid more than $1 million from the state since then. “He’s a great ambassador for our state and cares about where he comes from,” Otte Coleman said. Duhamel was the honorary chairman of a fund that raised millions of dollars for victims of a 2011 flood in his hometown that swamped more than 4,000 homes and businesses. About 11,000 people were forced to evacuate. The home where Duhamel grew up and his sister’s family’s home were both severely damaged. He appealed to his fans on social media and on TV appearances to help the victims of the flood. His current two-year tourism deal expires in December. Otte Coleman said she expects Duhamel to sign an extension.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s debut of its new license plate failed to take off because a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer. The new license plate illustrates rays of sunlight beaming into the sky, with a banner that reads “Birthplace of Aviation” draped across the horizon. But the banner, which should have been trailing behind the plane, was attached to its front. After the unveiling, Ohio officials said in a statement that they were aware of the mishap and that it would be corrected to show the banner trailing the plane before Ohioans upgrade their plates. Ohio isn’t the only entity to make this flighty error. The front of the Wright Flyer can easily be mistaken for its back because the plane’s propellers were located at the back, instead of the front. The plates are expected to land on the market Dec. 29.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye unexpectedly resigned from the post Friday, effective immediately, the state health department said. Department spokesperson Rachel Klein said Frye “felt it was time to move on” from leading the agency. His departure came a day after state Republican leaders, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, expressed outrage upon learning the health department in May issued a birth certificate with a nonbinary gender designation. The birth certificate was issued as part of a settlement with an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident. The settlement was reached under the administration of former state Attorney General Mike Hunter, Frye said. In a statement released by the department Friday, Frye lauded “the dedication, resilience and tenacity of the OSDH team.” “They have worked tirelessly over the last two years to ensure Oklahomans had access to not only COVID-19 testing, vaccinations and critical information, but to other life-saving services,” he said in the statement. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed has been named interim commissioner of health, according to Kevin Corbett, state Secretary of Health and Mental Health.\n\nOregon\n\nThe Dalles: The massive Google data centers on the edge of this Columbia River town are triggering concerns about water usage. Now a critical part of modern computing, data centers help people stream movies, conduct transactions, post updates on social media, store trillions of photos and more. But a single facility can also churn through millions of gallons of water per day to keep hot-running equipment cool. Google wants to build at least two more data centers in The Dalles, worrying some residents who fear there eventually won’t be enough water for everyone – including for area farms and fruit orchards, which are by far the biggest users. The Dalles is the seat of Wasco County, which is suffering extreme and exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The region last summer endured its hottest days on record, reaching 118 degrees Fahrenheit in The Dalles. The new data centers wouldn’t be able to use Columbia River water and instead would take it from rivers and groundwater that has gone through the city’s water treatment plant. However, the snowpack in the nearby Cascade Range that feeds the aquifers varies wildly year-to-year, and glaciers are melting. Adding to the unease: The 15,000 town residents don’t know how much water the proposed data centers will use because Google calls it a trade secret.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The School District of Philadelphia is working to repatriate Native American skeletal remains found in a high school classroom closet this summer. A letter sent to parents of Central High School students Friday said the “human skeletal item” was previously used as a teaching aid and dated back to the 1850s. The district consulted with the Department of Interior, Temple University and other experts about how to handle the remains, Evelyn Nunez, the district’s chief of schools, wrote in the letter to parents. “The District is also working with these partners to return this person, who has been identified as a male Native American, to his home tribe,” she said. Central High School, founded in 1836, is the second-oldest continuously operating public high school in the country, but it is not alone in its history of using skeletal remains as learning tools. In a statement Friday, the district said the remains were likely used in teaching through the mid-1900s at the latest, but the district’s schools have not used skeletal remains in classrooms for more than a decade. The district has launched a search of inventories at all of its schools to make sure any other skeletal remains are identified, treated with respect and also repatriated if possible.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Legislature has created a website to post the proposals it’s receiving for spending federal funds to help the state recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Rhode Island was allocated $1.1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee is urging the Legislature to start spending, saying Rhode Island is the only state in the Northeast that has not used any of its federal pandemic relief funding yet. The General Assembly created a section on its website for residents to see all of the ideas that are being suggested. The goal is to increase transparency. “With such a large infusion of federal funding, it is critical that the process of allocating these funds is done in a transparent manner that allows the public to access the information being shared with legislators,” House Speaker Joe Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “We encourage the public to be engaged so we use this money to its maximum benefit for Rhode Islanders.” Submitting a recommendation to the portal should not be viewed as a formal request for funding, and it does not guarantee a response, public hearing or appropriation from the General Assembly, the Legislature said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: A widow is suing Charleston County two years after her husband died following a ketamine injection he received during an arrest. The complaint filed by Tabitha Eileen Britt earlier this month says the two paramedics who injected her husband, James Britt, with the sedative drug after he was handcuffed by Mount Pleasant police in 2019 weren’t authorized to do so under state law. The Post and Courier reports Tabitha Britt wants a judge to stop county paramedics from using ketamine to aid law enforcement without a medical reason. A police report says Mount Pleasant officers were dispatched Sept. 30, 2019, for a man urinating on the roadway. According to the lawsuit, one officer initially stopped to help James Britt change a car tire before she said she would arrest him for public intoxication. According to the complaint, police forced James Britt to the ground in a prone position, where he repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. One paramedic who arrived at the scene then injected James Britt with 500 mg of ketamine, the maximum dose under county guidelines. The suit says James Britt stopped breathing minutes later; although he was resuscitated in the ambulance, he never regained consciousness and died less than three weeks later in the hospital.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: A study that focuses on ways to cool streams during the hottest times of the year in an effort to preserve the trout population is yielding positive results, officials from the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks say. Jeremy Kientz, a fisheries biologist with the agency, has been working to discover ways to cool the waters, in a study that specifically focuses on French Creek in Custer State Park. He said it’s one of a few trout streams in the Black Hills that can reach temperatures up to 80 degrees for several hours a day, increasing the chances of trout mortality. “We’ve had a couple instances here in the Black Hills where we’ve had trout fish kills because of temperatures that are too high in the summertime,” Kientz said. “When the water temperature hits 80 degrees, and it stays there for a little while, the trout will die. Even at 75 degrees, trout shut down, and they don’t eat. So now you not only have a survival issue but a growth issue.” But working on ways to cool the streams is not easy, Kientz said. Building shade takes time, and dams have become unpopular, not to mention expensive. So Kientz said he has been working with mechanical engineers from North Dakota State University to build small pockets of cooled water where trout can seek refuge when temperatures rise, the Black Hills Pioneer reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An area school district can continue requiring students to wear masks in school after a federal judge on Friday extended a ruling blocking an opt-out provision. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by the families of two children with disabilities who attend Williamson County schools. They claim Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates puts their children at risk and violates their educational rights. In the Friday opinion, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found that “disabled students are at a significantly higher risk for severe infection and are exposed at a higher rate following” following Lee’s executive order. He called that “an irreparable harm” that justifies continuing to block the order. “The record before the Court establishes that temporary universal mask mandates adopted by the Williamson County and Franklin school systems have been, and likely would continue to be, effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19,” Crenshaw wrote. “Executive Order No. 84 violates federal law and must yield.” The ruling mirrors those by federal judges in Memphis and Knoxville, where Lee’s order is also blocked. As a result, school districts in Shelby, Williamson and Knox counties can continue to enforce universal mask policies.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the state law that bans most abortions to remain in place but has agreed to hear arguments in the case in early November. The justices said Friday that they will decide whether the Justice Department and abortion providers can sue in federal court over a law that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said was “enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas.” Answering that question will help determine whether the law should be blocked while legal challenges continue. The court is moving at an unusually fast pace that suggests it plans to make a decision quickly. Arguments are set for Nov. 1. The court’s action leaves in place for the time being a law that clinics say has led to an 80% reduction in abortions in the nation’s second-largest state. The justices said in their order that they were deferring action on a request from the Justice Department to put the law on hold. Sotomayor wrote that she would have blocked the law now. “The promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care, who are entitled to relief now,” Sotomayor wrote. It takes just four justices to decide to hear a case.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A federal civil rights investigation released Thursday found widespread racial harassment of Black and Asian American students at a school district, including hundreds of documented uses of the N-word and other racial epithets over the past five years. The probe also found physical assaults, derogatory racial comments and harsher discipline for students of color at Davis School District, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. The district has agreed to take several steps as part of a settlement agreement, including a new department to handle complaints, more training and data collection. Black students throughout the district told investigators about similar experiences of white and non-Black students calling them the N-word, referring to them as monkeys or apes, and saying their skin was dirty or looked like feces, according to the department’s findings. Students also made monkey noises at their Black peers, repeatedly referenced slavery and lynching, and told Black students to “go pick cotton,” and “you are my slave.” The investigation found Black students were also disciplined more harshly than their white peers for similar behavior and were denied the ability to form student groups while supporting similar requests by other students.\n\nVermont\n\nGuilford: The state has erected a historical marker recognizing the life of Lucy Terry Prince, an African American poet who wrote what is thought to be the oldest known poem by an African American. The marker was unveiled this week at the Interstate 91 welcome center in Guilford. Prince and her husband lived in Guilford in the late 1700s. As a child, Lucy Terry was stolen from Africa and enslaved in Deerfield, Massachusetts, the marker says. Her poem “Bars Fight” tells the story of the 1746 attack on Deerfield settlers. The poem “endured in oral tradition for over 100 years before appearing on the front page of the Springfield Daily Republican in 1854,” the marker says. She became free after marrying Abijah Prince in 1756, and the couple settled on 100 acres in Guilford in 1769, according to the marker.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The city’s schools will close for the entire first week of November, including two days “in the interest” of workers’ mental health, the superintendent announced. Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras announced the change Wednesday, noting the stress schools employees are under, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. “Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve heard directly from dozens of teachers, principals, and support staff about how stressful this year has been,” Kamras said in a letter. “Many have shared that they’re on the brink of burning out – even leaving – and it’s only October.” Richmond schools were already set to be closed three days that week, for Election Day, Diwali and parent-teacher conferences. Kamras also announced changes to address three major stressors: doing too much, not enough time, and students “exhibiting significant trauma from the past 20 months.” There will be no new programs, initiatives or curricula, and the system is adding 100 lunch monitors to help free up teachers at lunch time, Kamras said. He also authorized principles to make changes needed to “hold independent teacher planning time more sacred.” Kamras said he aims to reallocate $3 million of federal relief funding to boost student mental health support.\n\nWashington\n\nPort Angeles: About 40 shipping containers tumbled into the Pacific Ocean in rough seas west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca entrance Friday, authorities said. The ship then caught fire Saturday as a result of powdered chemicals that had been spilled, The Seattle Times reports. The U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Northwest said on Twitter on Friday afternoon that the ship lost the containers when it listed to its side. A Coast Guard helicopter from Port Angeles was sent to the area, and the crew was monitoring 35 floating containers as they moved north. The ship was headed to Canada when the incident happened, officials said. Photos from the helicopter captured containers, with one group of three linked together, floating in the water, a Coast Guard Twitter post showed. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is located northwest of Seattle. “The ship is on fire and expelling toxic gas,” a navigation warning sent to area ships said, according to the Times. “Two fallen containers are floating in the vicinity of the vessel.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Top state officials on Friday said they would welcome three Maryland counties that inquired about becoming part of the Mountain State, even though the likelihood of the union is almost nonexistent. “We’re absolutely standing here with open arms,” West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said during a news conference that included state Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who also offered their support. Justice offered to call state lawmakers back for a special session to vote on a resolution that would add about 250,000 people in Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties in Maryland to West Virginia. Maryland officials representing the counties wrote letters dated Oct. 14 to Blair and Hanshaw expressing interest in joining West Virginia, news outlets report. The letters were signed by Maryland state Sen. George Edwards and Dels. Wendell Beitzel, Jason Buckel, Mike McKay and William Wivell. “The western areas of the state feel they’re being shortchanged in a lot of respects, and we had a lot of constituents approaching us … saying, ‘Why can’t we just join West Virginia?’ It’s just that simple,” Beitzel told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Friday halted the state’s fall wolf season two weeks before hunters were set to take to the woods, siding with wildlife advocacy groups who argued that holding the hunt would be unconstitutional. Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost issued a temporary injunction halting the season, which was set to begin Nov. 6. The order comes as part of a lawsuit that a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups filed in August seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate a state law authorizing annual seasons. Among other things, the coalition argued that the season is illegal because the Department of Natural Resources hasn’t updated its regulations setting up season parameters and has been relying on an emergency rule put in place shortly after then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a law in 2012 authorizing annual seasons and a wolf management plan that hasn’t been updated since 2007. Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional on its face, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it. The law gives the DNR great leeway in setting kill limits, hunting zone hours and the number of licenses, making it all the more important that the agency follow the regulatory process to ensure it doesn’t violate the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: COVID-19 has hospitalized more residents than at any point in the COVID-19 pandemic, with one public health officer saying the situation is “like a war zone” at one of the state’s biggest hospitals. Wyoming hospitals had 249 COVID-19 patients Thursday, topping the previous high of 247 in November. The vast majority weren’t vaccinated. Unvaccinated people have accounted for 98% of all new cases in Wyoming since May 1, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming’s surge coincides with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., currently about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower for COVID-19 inoculation. The strain on Wyoming hospitals, meanwhile, has been more prolonged than previously. Last fall and winter, hospitalizations stayed above 200 for about three weeks. This year, they have hovered around 200 since early September. Wyoming Medical Center in Casper has been treating about 30% of Wyoming’s COVID-19 patients but lately has been denying transfer requests. “It’s like a war zone,” the Casper area’s health officer, Dr. Mark Dowell, told a county health board Thursday. “The ICU is overrun, and there are a lot of patients being admitted.” Five Wyoming hospitals have at some point gone into crisis standards of care during the current surge.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/21/white-house-plays-cleanup-after-bidens-marathon-press-conference/6598119001/", "title": "White House plays cleanup after Biden's marathon press conference", "text": "WASHINGTON — After a year of avoiding regular solo press conferences and frequent interviews with reporters, President Joe Biden took the opposite approach Wednesday.\n\nFor 1 hour and 51 minutes, Biden stood at a lectern in the White House East room, fielding more than 180 questions from 24 reporters.

The evening serves as a benefit for the museum's Costume Institute. Last year's event took in a whopping $17.4 million for the institute, per the Associated Press.\n\nThe event's conception was led by industry-transforming publicist Eleanor Lambert, elevating American fashion to achieve global respect, according to the Council of Fashion Designers of America.\n\nThe Met Gala started as a \"midnight supper\" in 1948, according to Vogue.

After moving to Paris at age 14, Lagerfeld – who dropped the \"t\" from his surname to make it sound \"more commercial\" – worked under French designer Pierre Balmain as a junior assistant and later as an apprentice.\n\nFollowing stints with Balmain and Jean Patou’s fashion house, Lagerfeld began designing collections for luxury brands including Chloé, Fendi, Valentino and shoemaker Charles Jourdan. His sartorial stature soared to new heights in the '80s when he revitalized French fashion house Chanel with zeitgeisty looks and launched his own eponymous label.\n\nLagerfeld became a darling of the celebrity world, gaining the admiration of high-profile stars such as Lady Gaga, Kristen Stewart and Beyoncé. Some of these stars, including Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, paid tribute to the designer's legacy by appearing on a commemorative May cover of Vogue alongside other models he \"loved most.\"\n\nLagerfeld was also interested in photography and illustration.

Collections feature ready-to-wear looks for men, women and children. The brand also offers an assortment of accessories including watches, bags, eyewear, perfumes and jewelry.\n\nInspired equally by the cerebral and the carnal, Lagerfeld set out to create designs that reflected his self-coined concept of \"intellectual sexiness.\" The label went on to open more than 200 stores across the world, including in Paris, London and New York.\n\nIn 2005, Lagerfeld sold the brand to American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nTommy Hilfiger's NYFW return:Travis Barker closes out rainy outdoor show, Julia Fox models\n\nHow did Karl Lagerfeld die?\n\nLagerfeld died Feb. 19, 2019, around the age of 85 (he reportedly had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938). A cause of death was not given. Lagerfeld had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, worrying fans. He did not come out to take a bow at Chanel's couture show in Paris in January 2019, which the company attributed to fatigue.\n\nSeveral stars and industry colleagues mourned the loss of Lagerfeld and his influence in fashion, including then-Chanel CEO Alain Wertheimer.\n\n\"Thanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time,\" Wertheimer said in a release at the time.\n\nFrom 2019:Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, creative director for Chanel and Fendi, dies\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's cat became a viral sensation\n\nLagerfeld's cat, a white Siamese named Choupette, gave the designer a run for his money in the fame department. The feline amassed over 45,000 followers on Twitter and over 200,000 on Instagram thanks to a pair of fan accounts that featured snarky commentary written from the cat's imagined point of view.\n\nAhead of the Met Gala on Monday, Kim Kardashian posted a series of selfies of her hanging out with Choupette. \"Had a date with (Choupette) in Paris,\" she wrote Wednesday.\n\nLagerfeld's love for Choupette, who he stole from a friend when he was on vacation, ran so deep that he told CNN in a 2013 interview that he wanted to marry his furry companion. \"I never thought I would fall in love like this with a cat,\" he said.\n\nIn a March 2015 interview with The Cut, Lagerfeld revealed Choupette had a pair of personal maids that looked after her, as well as underwent beauty treatments for her eyes.\n\n\"There is something unforgettable about her, the way she moves, the way she plays,\" Lagerfeld told the outlet. \"She’s an inspiration for elegance. For attitude.\"\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's cat has two maids ANDshe does 'eye beauty treatments'\n\nKarl Lagerfeld stirred controversy with comments on #MeToo, Heidi Klum, fatphobia, Adele\n\nWhile Lagerfeld became a fashion heavyweight for his cutting-edge looks, he also had a controversial track record of making statements that were not in vogue.\n\nDuring a 2018 interview with French fashion magazine Numéro, Lagerfeld criticized the #MeToo movement and its impact on the fashion and modeling industries.\n\n\"What shocks me most in all of this are the starlets who have taken 20 years to remember what happened. Not to mention the fact there are no prosecution witnesses,\" Lagerfeld told the outlet. \"I read somewhere that now you must ask a model if she is comfortable with posing. It's simply too much, from now on, as a designer, you can’t do anything.\"\n\nKarl Lagerfeld calls models 'stupid,' 'sordid creatures': Model Alliance fires back\n\nIn the same interview, Lagerfeld insulted models as being \"stupid,\" \"toxic\" and overall \"sordid creatures.\" Sara Ziff, founder of fashion-industry group Model Alliance, called his comments a \"flippant dismissal\" of sexual harassment and abuse in the industry.\n\nLagerfeld, who co-authored a diet book after losing 92 pounds in 13 months, was vocally critical throughout his career of women larger than size 0 or 2. That included his defense of designers exclusively hiring rail-thin runway models. \"Fashion is the healthiest motivation for losing weight,\" he said, according to the book \"The World According to Karl,\" a collection of Lagerfeld quotes.\n\nAsked in a 2009 Focus interview about German women's magazine Brigitte declaring it would only publish photographs of \"real women,\" as opposed to professional models, Lagerfeld said, \"You’ve got fat mothers with their bags of chips sitting in front of the television and saying that thin models are ugly. The world of beautiful clothing is about 'dreams and illusions.'\"\n\nLagerfeld also publicly shared critiques of certain celebrities. In 2009, he called supermodel Heidi Klum \"insignificant\" in the fashion world because she was \"too glamorous\"; he criticized singer Adele as \"a little too fat\" in 2012; and later that year he dissed Pippa Middleton's face, suggesting she only show her backside.\n\nHe even got into a fracas with Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep when he claimed in 2017 that she dropped out of wearing a Chanel dress to that year’s Academy Awards in favor of a brand that would pay her.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld criticized immigration, same-sex marriage\n\nA self-professed \"big mouth,\" Lagerfeld sounded off on sociopolitical issues, including immigration and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2017, Lagerfeld sniped at Angela Merkel, then the German chancellor, for opening Germany's borders to migrants during the Syrian refugee crisis in Europe two years prior.\n\nIn some English translations of his appearance on French talk show \"Salut les Terriens!\" Lagerfeld offered this anecdote: \"I know someone in Germany who took (in) a young Syrian and after four days said: 'The greatest thing Germany invented was the Holocaust.'\"\n\nNick Cannon on 'growth' since 2020 antisemitic remarks, 'educational' podcast with ADL CEO\n\nLagerfeld rebuked same-sex marriage in a 2010 interview with Vice magazine, particularly as it pertains to two men.\n\n\"For me it’s difficult to imagine – one of the papas at work and the other at home with the baby. How would that be, for the baby? I don’t know,\" Lagerfeld said. \"I see more lesbians married with babies than I see boys married with babies.

The mood was formal but loose: At one point during the show in the slightly chilly hall, the tuxedoed Gordy, 93, donned a black beanie.\n\nFriday’s festive red-carpet event was the latest testament to the legacy carved together by Gordy, Robinson and their myriad Motown colleagues at West Grand Boulevard and beyond. Like most Motown concert celebrations, the 2½-hour gala rolled back the years while accentuating the music’s timelessness.\n\nGuests at the dinner gala sipped selections from Robinson’s new line of California wines, with names such as My Girl Chardonnay and Being With You Pinot Noir.\n\nThe MusiCares Person of the Year gala, a longtime Grammy week staple, is the main annual fundraiser for the Recording Academy’s charitable arm. This was the first time in the event’s 32-year history that two individuals were dually honored.\n\nThe 65th Grammy Awards will take place Sunday at L.A.’s Crypto.com arena, airing live on CBS at 8 p.m.\n\nIn an emotional segment late in Friday’s MusiCares program, Robinson noted he had been blessed through the years to receive many honors for his work. But the shared Person of the Year with Gordy, he said, was the most special of them all \"because I’m getting awards with my best friend in the world.”\n\nMore:Motown Museum to reopen Feb. 22 as expansion work continues\n\nMore:The White Stripes, Spinners nominated for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nRobinson recalled the “God date” he experienced in late 1957, when he met Gordy after an audition by his group the Matadors, soon to become the Miracles, at a Detroit talent agency.\n\n“That day, the seed was planted for the best friendship in history,” Robinson said, drawing awwws from the crowd as he went on to wax affectionately about his love for Gordy.\n\nGordy was a songwriter and producer with a toehold in the business, Robinson a teenage aspiring artist and fast learner. Something clicked, and the two became inseparable confidantes and mutual cheerleaders as Gordy went on to launch the enterprise that became Motown Records.\n\nRobinson, 82 and still in fine form onstage, had some audience members wiping their eyes as he performed the simple, lovely “Did You Know,” a dedication to Gordy he premiered at the Motown founder’s Kennedy Center Honors induction in 2021.\n\nGordy was happy to mostly just take in the proceedings. Onstage to accept his Person of the Year award, he was asked by Recording Academy chief Harvey Mason Jr. whether he’d like to say anything. “Not particularly!” Gordy cracked.\n\n“I’m happy to be here with my best friend,” he added. “Damn!”\n\nOn the red carpet, Motown’s significance — musically, culturally, socially, racially — was hailed by artists young, old and in between.\n\nSheryl Crow said she plays Motown music “ad nauseam” for her sons.\n\n“I feel like I’m doing the right thing,” she said. “I grew up with it. My 15-year-old is a great bass player and he’s learning James Jamerson just like I did.”\n\nIn a business where jealousies often boil over and money matters can fracture friendships, the long bond of Gordy and Robinson is unique. Veteran record exec Phil Quartararo paid tribute.\n\n“They were both songwriters. They were both executives,” he said on the red carpet. “But importantly, they were just two guys who became genuine friends. They did family stuff together. They came from the street together. They moved to California together. It’s really the most symbiotic relationship you can imagine.”\n\nThe MusiCares fundraising gala was a swanky affair — some of Friday’s tables went for $70,000 — and the audience of about 2,500 was packed with industry big guns and glitterati.\n\nBut Friday also had a touch of family affair — the kind of night when Gordy and Robinson could glance up and spot any number of old Detroit comrades, from Otis Williams and his Temptations to Duke Fakir and his Four Tops. Robinson was joined by his wife, Frances Glandney, and Gordy’s entourage included six of his children. Other Detroit guests included Robin Terry, Gordy’s great-niece and head of the Motown Museum.\n\nStevie Wonder, who helped close out the night onstage, lavished affection on Gordy and Robinson.\n\n“All of my appreciation, respect, love goes to you, Berry — who thought I couldn’t sing,” Wonder said, drawing laughs as he launched into his time-tested imitation of the Motown founder. He went on to thank Robinson and late Miracles member Ronnie White for getting him in the door at Hitsville.\n\nWonder fixated the crowd with a spare rendition of the Miracles “I'll Try Something New” at his harpejji. He then moved to a keyboard for a reggae-fied workout on “The Tears of a Clown,” noting that while Robinson didn’t like that arrangement, “a great song never dies.”\n\nWonder was a reliable musical highlight in a night with many.\n\nLionel Richie hailed Gordy and Robinson as “two of my amazing mentors” and dear friends before launching into a supple rendition of the Commodores’ “Easy.”\n\nThe Temptations kicked off the night with a four-song medley of hits, capped with the Robinson-penned “My Girl” and drawing a standing ovation. The group’s friendly Motown rival, the Four Tops, later served up its own quartet of tunes, including a lively “It’s the Same Old Song” that had U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi bopping along at a table with Elton John.\n\nA few artists played it straight (Sheryl Crow doing her best young Michael Jackson on “I Want You Back,” Chloe x Halle sweetly harmonizing on the Supremes’ “Baby Love”). Others shook things up, like Mumford & Sons drilling “Money (That’s What I Want)” down into its bare bluesy essence and Samara Joy, a best new artist Grammy nominee, reworking Marvin Gaye’s “Ain’t That Peculiar.”\n\nStrong showings also came from Trombone Shorty (Junior Walker’s “Shotgun”), Michael McDonald (Jackie Wilson’s “Lonely Teardrops”) and bulletproof song interpreter Brandi Carlile, who wowed with her take on the Miracles’ “The Tracks of My Tears.”\n\nThe program was taped, though a broadcast plan isn’t yet set.\n\nGordy and Robinson were certainly the stars of the night, but the real significance Friday was MusiCares, the Recording Academy’s philanthropic arm, which provides health funding and social services to musicians and industry professionals in need. During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization gave out $37 million to 47,000 of them.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/05/02/met-gala-2017-worst-dressed-kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-dakota-johnson/101187634/", "title": "Met Gala 2017: A look at the worst dressed", "text": "Maeve McDermott\n\nUSATODAY\n\nNEW YORK -- Well, this was bound to happen.\n\nMonday's Met Gala honored Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo, famous for her avant-garde designs that blur the lines between art and fashion. And considering that the night's celebrity attendees were expected to honor the boundary-pushing designer with their red carpet fashion, some sartorial missteps were inevitable.\n\nYet, many of the evening's most disappointing looks came not from celebrities who went too far with their fashion choices, but from those who didn't try to follow the theme. Specifically, the looks from the Jenners and Hadids missed the mark, showing the young fashion darlings ignoring the gala's directive to honor Kawakubo's innovative designs, and sticking to their barely-there red carpet wardrobes.\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nAt an event where plenty of her peers made risky outfit choices to stick to the evening's theme, both Kendall and Kylie Jenner opted for their usual naked-dress formalwear. The event celebrated one of fashion's most boundary-breaking figures, so to see Kendall, one of her industry's fastest-rising young stars, opt for a dress from lingerie brand La Perla was a missed opportunity.\n\nAnd while Rihanna's sequined thong at the 2014 CFDA Fashion Awards inspired a generation of naked dresses, Jenner's black undergarments, which she similarly let show through her gown, didn't channel Rih as much as Rose McGowan's deeply unfortunate look at the 1998 VMAs.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nBella had the more talked-about and exciting look of the Hadid sisters with her see-through, sequined Alexander Wang jumpsuit, with the designer declaring that the young model is the \"body of a generation\" on the carpet.\n\nBut her sister Gigi's French maid-channeling Tommy Hilfiger ensemble featuring an asymmetrical nude dress paired with thigh-high fishnets missed the mark.\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nWhen the rapper shows up at red-carpet events, he's normally smoking illegal substances while wearing some sort of questionable suit, and Met Gala was no different. But Wiz's Thom Browne white suit jacket with cartoonish black piping and matching boots were enough of a crime without the drug use included.\n\nMandy Moore\n\nThis was not Mandy's night. The actress's Michael Kors dress attempted an optical illusion with asymmetrical sleeves and black glove that didn't quite work. Combined with mismatched earrings and unflattering lavender eyeshadow and the whole thing was off.\n\nThandie Newton\n\nAt least she went for it. Newton's Monse drawstring red dress studded with Swarovski crystals could've used a little less ruching, but the real problem was with the giant flower she wore on her head, which looked more like a Kentucky Derby hat than a high-fashion headpiece.\n\nDakota Johnson\n\nJohnson seemingly attempted to honor Kawakubo's love of voluminous garments with her goth Gucci look. Unfortunately, the ruffles around her face were more of a distraction than showpiece.\n\nCara Delevingne\n\nProps to Delevingne's bold fashion choices, showing the young actress/model attempting a daring, silver Chanel suit while her peers played it safe. However, considering that her next project is the intergalactic action movie Valerian, her silver-painted head looked a little too sci-fi.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2013/09/22/yankees-honor-mariano-rivera-in-pregame-ceremony/2849629/", "title": "Yankees honor Mariano Rivera in pregame ceremony", "text": "Howard Megdal\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMariano Rivera is retiring at the end of this season\n\nRivera made his debut in 1995 and took over the stopper role two years later\n\nNEW YORK — Mariano Rivera quietly dressed by his locker on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium,as he has so many times in his incomparable career, but will do only a few more times before he retires at the end of the 2013 season.\n\nAndy Pettitte is the announced starting pitcher, and no one approached him, honoring the reporter/player rules of engagement. But no one from the media approached Rivera, either, as he readied himself for the kind of ceremony only a handful of Yankees ever received, few even as deserving.\n\n\"I think it means a lot,\" manager Joe Girardi told reporters on what he thought the honoring ceremony would mean to Rivera. \"I think that as time goes on, it will mean even more, as he has a chance to digest everything that's gone on this year, what the Yankees have meant to him, what he's meant to the Yankees.\"\n\nGirardi caught Rivera in the clinching game of the 1996 World Series, and 17 years later, Girardi leaned on his 43-year-old closer to keep his fading team in the pennant race, asking him to pitch repeatedly on back-to-back days, earn multi-inning saves, at 43 years old. Rivera's September ERA? 2.45.\n\n\"I think it just tells you who he is,\" Girardi, now 48 and retired for a decade, said. \"He does everything he possibly can to be successful. He prepares himself physically, mentally. To be able to do that at 43 is mind-boggling to me. I really believe that in our lifetime, I don't know that we'll be able to say that about another pitcher.\"\n\nThat sense, of an era ending, permeated the stadium hours before first pitch. The customary call of \"Programs!\" was rendered unnecessary, with the largest lines, by far for that particular keepsake. No one, with Rivera's retirement, will ever wear it again, and Jackie Robinson's wife, Rachel, and daughter Sharon, stood with Rivera as he was honored.\n\n\"I thought it would be a special day to share with him,\" Tommy Little said, dressed head to toe in Yankees gear and carrying Dylan, 2, in his arms. Little was merely one of many parents carrying tiny Yankee fans around the stadium, wanting their children to have a link to a great among greats. \"He's only two, but he knows the Yankees, and he cheers for the Yankees.\" Dylan, unprompted, illustrated with an enthusiastic \"Go Yankees!\"\n\nAdam Warren wasn't much older than little Dylan when Rivera began pitching to Girardi. He smiled at the thought of getting to experience an iconic moment in baseball history, even as he prepared for a game with the Yankees still mathematically alive for the postseason.\n\n\"I talked about it the other day with a couple of teammates,\" Warren said by his locker. \"Growing up, watching Mo and Andy and those guys, kind of looking up to them, a chance to play with them was an honor for me. To be here on this day when we're honoring them, it's the end of an era, but at the same time, kind of passing the torch to us younger guys.\"\n\nEven for something as straightforward as a ceremony, Rivera meticulously went over the plan with a Yankees employee. Rivera's ability to be undeterred by the few blown saves when they came, by any situation, had a lot to do with his ability to prepare. So just to be sure, he asked once again, \"We start at 12? Okay.\"\n\nThen Rivera walked out of the clubhouse, every pair of eyes following him, still adjusting to the idea that he's be doing that, soon, for the final time. Outside, a crowd gathered which had more in common with the gatherings at old Yankee Stadium in October than this season's crowds.\n\nFans posed for pictures in front of the field, even more 42s than usual worn in honor of the final major leaguer who will ever do so. The usual grounds crew pregame work of meticulously drawing the foul lines went on in concert with the folding chairs and podium just in front of the mound, the tasks done by men wearing football-style 42 jerseys. A bandstand stood in center field. A graphical rendering of the Mariano Rivera patch moved slowly to the left and right on the center field scoreboard.\n\nSoon after, a 42 appeared along the first-base line, then between home and third. There was a game to play, and simultaneously, an incomparable career to honor. Even for the great Rivera, the former eventually gave way to the latter, though seldom so much on the player's own terms.\n\nThe Yankees gathered at the top step around 12:50. Earlier, Warren described what he expected his thinking to be: \"I'm just going to soak it in. Obviously, we have a game to play, so we're obviously going to keep our minds on that. Also, at the same time, take a moment between innings, before the game, during the ceremony, just to reflect on it, just how special it is to be a part of.\"\n\nJohn Sterling, radio play-by-play man for the Yankees, and Michael Kay, his television counterpart, took turns at the podium. Among other tributes, Sterling read the Mariano Rivera Day proclamation from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in its entirety.\n\nBut finally, it was time for Rivera himself. He smiled, shaking his head at the length of a standing ovation that went on and on. Robinson's wife and daughter unveiled a plaque in Monument Park for Robinson. And then the Yankees, having suitably honored Robinson, added a Yankee-pinstriped 42 alongside the other retired numbers.\n\nA loud voice bellowed, sing-song, \"Mariano!\" The crowd quickly took it up as one. The dignitaries took their positions in front of the mound: Gene Michael, the GM who signed him; John Wetteland, the closer who immediately preceded him (now 47, and retired for 13 years); Jorge Posada, who caught 368 of Rivera's 652 career saves; Joe Torre, his manager from 1996-2007, and even his family, wife Clara, sons Mariano Jr., Jafet and Jaziel.\n\nA video tribute to Rivera played. Metallica set up in center field. Bob Shepard's voice rang out, \"Coming in to pitch for the Yankees, number 42, Mariano Rivera. Number 42.\"\n\n\"Enter Sandman,\" an unfamiliar live version, began. Rivera slowly walked in from the bullpen in right-center field. The once-boisterous crowd flagged, taking it in like Warren, but grew louder as Rivera waved his hat to the crowd from the mound, Posada and Williams capturing the moment with their camera phones.\n\nA large Panamian flag was unfurled in the first-base stands while Rivera kissed Clara and hugged his teammates and children. The Mariano chant began anew, and on came the presents.\n\nA painting and a custom-built guitar signed by Willie Mays from the Giants. A custom-built speaker cabinet from Metallica to Rivera. A $100,000 check from the Yankees to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, not to mention a custom-built rocking chair, presented by Derek Jeter and Girardi. Rivera, a good sport, took it for a spin. Then, a replica of his retired number, and a Waterford Crystal replica of his mitt. Quite a haul.\n\nThen, simply, Michael Kay said: \"Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, Mariano Rivera!\" Out came his teammates to stand behind him.\n\nFighting back tears, Rivera thanked God first, who got a hand on par with the one for Bernie Williams. Then Clara and his children. \"It means a lot when you have your family around you,\" and they've been a constant presence.\n\n\"To my teammates, past and present, I appreciate you guys. The lord has blessed me with a big family, and all of these men have been part of this family.\" To Panama, a thanks in Spanish.\n\nAndy Pettitte walked in from the bullpen for his final home start. Rivera thanked the fans.\n\n\"You guys will have a part of my heart here in New York.\" He thanked the Giants, who also stood together in front of their own dugout, applauding Rivera. He thanked George Steinbrenner, \"who gave me this opportunity,\" and Rachel Robinson, \"Even though I never met him, he has been a hero, and an inspiration for me, and I thank Mr. Jackie Robinson for that.\n\n\"So let's play ball, man, we gotta go. So I love you guys! Thank you!\"\n\nAnd then there was a game to play.\n\nRivera gave long hugs to his family. The Mariano chant started up once again. The field was quickly cleared, while some disbelieving fans stared out from their seats, still standing, not quite believing it was over.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/05/01/shop-the-top-trends-from-the-met-gala-red-carpet/70171276007/", "title": "Shop the top trends from the Met Gala Red Carpet", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors.

Actress (and event co-chair) Michaela Coel was glowing in a glittering Schiaparelli gown, while Suki Waterhouse opted for an airy nude gown with floral embroidery. Amanda Seyfried opted for a nearly-naked look with a mini Oscar de la Renta dress that was dripping with beaded chains that concealed a skin-toned corset.\n\nAdd a barely-there look to your own wardrobe with the lace maxi dress with bodysuit by & Other Stories.

Both gowns use see-through black chiffon that'll add a touch of elegance to your nude-effect gown.\n\nCorset dresses worn by Jessica Chastain and Margot Robbie\n\nThe return of the corset has been praised by many—and criticized by some—and the trend reigned supreme on the Met Gala red carpet this year. Emily Ratajkowski wore a Tory Burch gown whose bodice was made to reflect the iconic quilted pattern of a Chanel purse. Jessica Chastain stunned in a Gucci gown that gave Glam Goth, along with a radical new platinum blonde look. Not to be outdone, Margot Robbie wore a reproduction of a 1993 Haute Couture Chanel gown that featured a boned corset with clear panels.\n\nThe Pintuck corset sweetheart maxi dress from Asos Design is an easy-to-wear take on the trend, offered in a vibrant cherry red shade that we saw on the Met Gala carpet on stars like Gabrielle Union and Kylie Jenner. The Corset Tiered Gown from Fame & Partners features a sweet corset, made with translucent chiffon layers to add lightness to the twist-on-a-classic style. Finally, the Bustier Gown from For Love & Lemons is a punk version of the trend with layers of light fabric and lace, combined with a thigh-high slit.\n\nPretty in pink—seen on Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss\n\nIf you were afraid that the Barbiecore trend had come and gone, you're in luck. Some of fashion's top players opted for rose-hued gowns that looked nothing like the styles we saw earlier during award's season. Naomi Campbell wore a pink Chanel Haute Couture gown from 2010 that resembled a traditional Indian sari. Fellow supermodel Kate Moss opted for a blush-toned Fendi gown, while her daughter Lila stunned in a feathered pink gown herself. Model Ashley Graham dialed up the old-Hollywood glamour with a Harris Reed gown that was designed in honor of a Karl Lagerfeld gown from 1983.\n\nFor your own take on la vie en rose, start with the classic design of the L'idée Sirene Off-Shoulder Puff-Sleeve Pleated Midi Column Dress, which uses gorgeous puff sleeves to add volume and visual interest. For a look that'll celebrate the sari-style of Campbell's vintage Chanel gown, opt for the Pink Viscose Crepe Embroidered Saree Gown from Vivek Patel. The dress features the same pleated length of pink satin along the shoulder to add a touch of elegance. Finally, the Look Into The Sun Gown from Free People is an easier, everyday take on a dusty pink that'll look right at home at any special event.\n\nClassic black and white seen on Julia Garner and Gisele Bündchen\n\nWhen the Met first announced that the theme of this year's Costume Institute exhibition would celebrate the work of Karl Lagerfeld, fashion girlies around the country knew that it would mean one thing: An abundance of black and white on the red carpet. The classic colors were a Chanel mainstay, and Lagerfeld used them with reckless abandon throughout his nearly 40-year tenure at the helm of the legendary fashion label. Classic black and white was seen on stars like Julia Garner, who wore a white gown with a stunning black velvet cape from Gucci. Meanwhile, Emily Blunt wore a twist on a classic with her Michael Kors gown.\n\nOne of the evening's most memorable style moments, however, came from singer/actress Janelle Monae, who arrived in a Thom Browne creation that was removed on the steps of the met to reveal a body-baring confection that stole the show.\n\nTo ramp up the glamour at your next event, look no further than the Grace Maxi Dress with Cape, which features a maxi gown with a deep V-neckline, leg slit, and a sophisticated full-length cape that adds a dramatic, contemporary feel. For a gown that'd be just at home at the Met Gala, consider the Two Tone Ruffled One Shoulder Gown, which features white petals combined with a black skirt for a timeless and enduring style. Finally, for a sweeter take on white, reach for the Magically Charming White Sequin Embroidered Lace-Up Maxi Dress, which is just as beautiful at a formal event as it would be to a dressed up dinner.\n\nTributes to Karl, worn by Doja Cat and Penelope Cruz\n\nFor fashion's biggest fans, the Met Gala this year would have been nothing without tributes to some of Karl Lagerfeld's most iconic designs and to Lagerfeld himself. Gala co-chair Penelope Cruz wore a reproduction of a Chanel Haute Couture design from spring 1988, while actress Olivia Wilde wore a reproduction of a 1983 dress that Lagerfeld designed for Chloé. The original Chloé gown is on view within the exhibition itself, and features the same guitar embroidery throughout.\n\nFinally, superstar musician Doja Cat wore a slinky Oscar de la Renta creation, though her look caught the eyes of spectators because of her prosthetic cat nose and dramatic feline makeup—a tribute to Lagerfeld's famous pet cat, Choupette. Actor Jared Leto, a Met Gala fixture, also opted to pay homage to Choupette, arriving to the red carpet in a full-fledged cat suit before changing into something more stylish.\n\nThe Dripped jewel embellished midi dress from Asos Design is nothing if not classic Lagerfeld. The dress is encrusted with rhinestones, giving the classic silhouette a glamorous, glittering upgrade. For something that better reflects Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, reach for the Sloan Sleeveless Midi Column Popcorn Dress, which will work for dressed-up affairs as well as work events and brunch with friends. Finally, if you really want to lean into a Choupette tribute, don't forget to order the Black Cat Adult Zipster. The onesie pajamas aren't very glamorous, but they'll certainly make a style statement.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is the annual fundraising gala held to benefit the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. Referred to many as the \"Oscars of fashion,\" the Met Gala also serves as the opening to the Costume Institute's spring fashion exhibition. The Gala has been chaired since 1995 by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, with recent Gala's also being co-chaired by carefully selected celebrity hosts.\n\nThe event is notoriously difficult to access and is closed to the public, with guest lists typically being kept under lock-and-key until the night of, and attendees spending upwards of $30,000 each to secure a seat at the table. The inner workings of the Met Gala were the subject of a 2016 documentary, The First Monday in May.\n\nWhen is the Met Gala this year?\n\nThe 2023 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 1, 2023. Indeed, the Gala occurs each year on the first Monday in May—except in 2020 and 2021 when the event was cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic.\n\nWhat is the theme for this year's Met Gala and exhibition?\n\nThis year's Costume Institute exhibition will be named \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" and will celebrate the designer's many contributions to the world of fashion. Attendees of the Met Gala have been instructed to dress in a way that honors the late designer Karl Lagerfeld, who passed away in 2019. \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" will be on view May 5-July 16, 2023 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nWho is co-chairing the Met Gala this year?\n\nThe four co-chair's for this year's festivities include actresses Michaela Coel and Penelope Cruz, singer Dua Lipa and athlete Roger Federer.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

It will be the restaurant's first Northeast location. Also opening is Brüt, a champagne bar featuring champagne from all over the world with sweet and savory pairings.\n\nThe common area of The Avenue will feature seating and sculptures designed by New Jersey native and interior decorator Jonathan Adler, who also plans to open a store in the wing.\n\nThe wing of the mall was originally named \"The Collection,\" but Downing and Don Ghermezian, president of American Dream, changed their minds after seeing the space take shape.\n\n\"The space is so grand,\" Downing said. \"Architecturally, it's unlike any shopping environment in the United States. Between the double-height storefronts, the sculpture garden spaces, it's like being on an avenue in any amazing shopping destination internationally.\"\n\nAs more eateries, stores, and even art galleries open, Downing said it will be a curated collection of shopping.\n\nThe opening will be the latest milestone reached after 17 years of stop-and-go progress on the mall once known as Xanadu.\n\nJust months after it finally opened in 2020, the mall was forced to close due to COVID-19.

It's looking more optimistic and people are returning.\"\n\nThe Dream Wheel\n\nCoinciding with the opening, the Ferris wheel called the Dream Wheel is on schedule to be completed.\n\nThe massive Ferris wheel has been under construction on the side of the mall by the water park. It will have 18 cabs that can carry 16 to 18 people, Downing said.\n\n\"They will have amazing views of the Meadowlands, Hudson River and Manhattan skyline,\" he said.\n\nPatrons can access the Dream Wheel on the third level of the mall through the food court.\n\nFashion Week\n\nThe opening of the wing coincides with New York Fashion Week, and that annual event will be honored with American fashion exhibits throughout The Avenue.\n\n\"It will be a wink and nod taking from what's going on at the Met Gala,\" Downing said, referring to the red-carpet benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art that draws the rich and famous in their most extravagant designer outfits.\n\nThe fashion exbibit will feature 21 collections from American fashion designers and artists that will stay up during the fall season.

It's the latest development in a case that has captured nationwide attention since a controversial ruling last week jeopardized mifepristone's approval. The Biden administration already has appealed U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision that would effectively revoke the FDA approval of the drug.

Democrat and Chronicle\n\nMike Chiapperini, Tomasz Kaczowka were shot and killed in an ambush Christmas Eve\n\n2 others who were wounded attended Saturday's viewing\n\nSome ponder whether changes needed to ensure safety of first responders\n\nWEBSTER, N.Y. -- Of the hundreds of first responders who waited outside in the snow and shuffled through the halls of a local high school Saturday, most had probably never met Mike Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka.\n\nIt didn't matter. They were brothers just the same.\n\n\"It's family,\" said Rich Jordan, chief of the Fairville Fire Department in Wayne County. \"No matter where you are, if you're a fireman, it's family anywhere in the country.\"\n\nOfficials estimated anywhere between 4,000 and 6,000 people attended the first three hours of the second day of the wake for Chiapperini, 43, and Kaczowka, 19, volunteer firefighters who were fatally shot on Christmas Eve on in Webster.\n\nPolice say William Spengler Jr. set a fire to lure first responders and then shot four, killing two, before killing himself.\n\nMany of those waiting in line Saturday to pay their respects were fellow emergency personnel from New York and Canada. They waited for hours in navy blue police suits, beige state trooper hats and military camouflage.\n\nThe firefighters wounded by Spengler, Joseph Hofstetter and Theodore Scardino, attended Saturday's calling hours as well.\n\nThey were brought in by ambulance, then transported back to a hospital, where they are both listed in satisfactory condition.\n\nThe first wake was held Friday night, and thousands gathered to remember the victims of Monday's tragic shootings.\n\nChiapperini's funeral service will be held Sunday, and a Mass for Kaczowka will be celebrated Monday.\n\nThe line on Saturday snaked through the hallways of the high school and out the door, into the snow. As visitors waited hours to pay tribute to the fallen firefighters for just a moment, volunteers offered water bottles, mints, tissues and hand warmers.\n\nSome of the fire and police departments conducted quick ceremonies in the gymnasium, saluting the flag-draped caskets. More than 200 members of the Rochester Fire Department lined up to salute the caskets.\n\n\"It's important that we support our own, and that's why we're here,\" said Don Trzepacz Sr., chief of Spring Brook Fire Department, in Elma, near Buffalo.\n\nHe drove about two hours with four other members of his department to pay respects. Five more were expected to make the trip after them.\n\n\"It's a brotherhood. We all stick together. We all support each other,\" he said.\n\nSome said they were shocked and disgusted to hear of the events Monday.\n\n\"You lose firefighters in fires every day,\" said Allen Mann, chief of the Cobourg Fire Department in Canada. \"That's part of the job, you accept that when you sign up. You don't sign up for this.\"\n\nMann drove about five hours with two other neighboring fire departments, from Baltimore and Bewdley.\n\nIn Walworth, Wayne County, Fire Chief John O'Toole said he was in disbelief when he first heard about Monday's tragedy.\n\n\"You head up to the firehouse and you talk to everybody else that's up there,\" he said. \"You just start talking.\"\n\nHe said it's hard to pin down whether firefighters' jobs would change based on the incident.\n\n\"You look and see what are the lessons learned,\" he said. But in this case, there's not many adjustments to be made, he said.\n\nJordan, from Fairville, said he thinks law enforcement might be sent out with fire personnel more.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the firefighters are thinking about one thing, he said — putting out the fire.\n\n\"The fastest you can get in on that fire for a call is the most important time, the first 15 minutes,\" he said. \"It's almost impossible to pull up and wait for a search to be done of the area or anything.\"\n\nHis assistant chief, Nick Loomis, agreed.\n\n\"You've got one thing on your mind and that's where the flames are,\" he said. \"All any chief wants is every guy to come home after the call.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/29"}]}

Bhagtana's truck then ran into the stopped line of traffic in the passing lane, hitting a 2009 Audi driven by Margaret Ryan, 22, of Boston, pushing it under the trailer of a semi in front of Ryan's vehicle.\n\nThe front end and front seats of Ryan's car were underneath the semi's trailer, which had its rear axle broken from the impact.\n\nRyan was pronounced dead at the scene, and her passenger, Christine Yip, 25, of St. Louis, Mo., was taken to Reid Health for treatment of serious injuries that were not considered life-threatening. She was able to talk to investigators, according to ISP's Sgt. John Bowling.\n\nThe driver of the second semi, William Weatherford III, 51, of Palm Coast, Fla., was uninjured, as were Bhagtana and Berry. Bhagtana was cited at the scene by Trooper Bryan Rumple for driving at a speed too fast to avoid a collision.\n\n\"I saw a blue car going into the ditch and a truck trying to stop, so I stopped,\" said Sal Farragamo, of Rockaway, N.Y., who was four or five vehicles behind the accident. \"I was doing probably 65 miles per hour or 70 miles per hour.

They said they saw the blue car fly through the air into the median and said the accident could have been much worse, but everyone behind the incident managed to stop without making contact with other vehicles.\n\nAccording to the Indiana Department of Transportation, eastbound I-70 was shut down at the Cambridge City interchange (Exit 137) for more than five hours. Traffic was diverted south onto Ind. 1 to U.S. 40, and a police officer was called to the Cambridge City interchange to help direct traffic.\n\nWestbound I-70 also was closed for a short time.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nIn all, more than 200 million people in the US were under wind chill alerts from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and from Washington state to Florida, with below-zero wind chills expected in the Southeast by Friday. Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/01/illinois-dust-storm-causes-massive-pileup-closes-traffic-for-30-miles/70172073007/", "title": "Illinois dust storm: 6 dead and dozens injured after massive pileup", "text": "At least six people are dead and dozens injured after a blinding dust storm caused a multi-vehicle pileup south of Springfield, Illinois, that Gov. J.B. Pritzker described as \"horrific.\"\n\nTraffic on Interstate 55 was shut down in both directions for nearly 30 miles.\n\nVideo images posted on Twitter showed dozens of cars and tractor-trailers in disarray amid billowing smoke and dust on both sides of the interstate late Monday morning. Flames were still visible from at least one vehicle. One photo depicted an almost apocalyptic scene of burnt wreckage silhouetted against the haze.\n\n“The cause of the crashes is due to excessive winds blowing dirt from farm fields across the highway, leading to zero visibility,” Illinois State Police Maj. Ryan Starrick said at a news conference.\n\nAccording to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the pileup took place just before 11 a.m. CDT near milepost 76 in south-central Illinois' Montgomery County, prompting authorities to close traffic between mileposts 52 and 80.\n\nAs of late Monday, the Illinois State Police said 72 vehicles were involved in the crashes, which included passenger cars and multiple tractor-trailers. Starrick said two tractor-trailers had caught fire. According to Montgomery County authorities, 10 helicopters were called to the scene in addition to a hazardous materials team to suppress fires, including a power tool battery blaze on a semitrailer.\n\nIllinois State Police also reported that 37 people ages 2 to 80 were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening.\n\nOf the six fatalities, one victim was identified Monday night as 88-year-old Shirley Harper of Franklin, Wisconsin. The Montgomery County Coroner's Office was working to identify the other five victims, according to the Illinois State Police.\n\nAccording to WSIL chief meteorologist Nick Hausen, dust blowing off freshly cultivated fields led to low visibility in the area.\n\nNathan Cormier told Weather.com he was driving on the interstate when he saw a cloud of smoke ahead.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer told The Associated Press that the area is flat and has few trees.\n\n“It’s been very dry across this area really for the last three weeks,\" Schaffer said. \"The farmers are out there tilling their fields and planting. The top layer of soil is quite loose.”\n\nHorrific 'dust bowl'\n\nEvan Anderson, 25, who was returning home to St. Louis from Chicago, said a semitruck turned before striking his vehicle, sparing him from even more damage.\n\n“You couldn’t even see,” Anderson said. “People try to slow down and other people didn’t, and I just got plowed into. There was just so many cars and semitrucks with so much momentum behind them.”\n\nKevin Schott, director of emergency services in Montgomery County, said it was a “very difficult scene” and one that’s “very hard to train for.”\n\n“We had to search every vehicle, whether they were involved in the accident or just pulled over, to check for injuries,” he said. “People were “upset − visibly so, understandably so.”\n\n\"I've driven through them before, you know,\" Cormier said. \"You put your hazards on, go slow. And I moved to the left lane to get away out from behind a semi. And that's when I came across everything else stopped in the road.”\n\nHe described the scene as a \"dust bowl.\"\n\nAuthorities directed people seeking to reunify with people involved in the crash to call 1-800-RedCross. Officials expected the roadway to be closed through the evening, and travelers were urged to seek alternate routes. Wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph had blown through the area, according to Weather.com.\n\nDust storms are rare in the area. In 2014, dust blowing off dry farm fields near Carlinville, 45 miles south of Springfield, led to multiple collisions on Illinois’ State Highway 108. One driver told the (Springfield) State Journal-Register that loose dirt from plowed soybean fields had produced clouds of dust along the freeway, and police said visibility was hampered to the point that drivers could not see beyond the hoods of their vehicles.\n\nContributing: Tiffini Jackson and Steven Spearie, State Journal-Register; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2019/10/03/lincoln-aviator-suv-recall-chicago-explorer-police-interceptor/3830654002/", "title": "Lincoln Aviator owners frustrated by problems with $70K+ luxury SUV", "text": "With just 1,899 Lincoln Aviator luxury SUVs sold since their debut in August, some owners report problems ranging from the emergency brake unexpectedly taking hold while they are driving to passenger-assist alarms going off randomly and a dashboard screen that scrambles information.\n\n“When you get in, the speedometer and tachometer kind of goes berserk,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “While driving, all of a sudden the digital gauge cluster seems to be having huge problems. For the first couple of miles, it’s hard to see what you’re doing.”\n\nConsumer Reports spent $63,420 to purchase the vehicle for testing and took delivery on Sept. 9.\n\nThe SUVs can range from $52,195 to $90,000, including delivery charges, a Lincoln spokeswoman said.\n\nLaurel Spencer, 46, a manufacturing executive from Glencoe, Illinois, paid about $70,000 for her Aviator in mid-August to use for commuting on business and taking kids to their activities.\n\n“After owning my car a month, I’m sorry I bought it,” she said Sept. 14. “It wasn’t more than 24 hours since I drove it off the lot that I had my first problem — a leaky sunroof … A week or so later, it was seat belts that didn’t work, and now it has been in the shop for nearly a week for computer malfunctions which had my crash detection set off when driving on a quiet road. The parking brake came on while driving, and a major transmission fault alarm went off. When they were fixing it, the seat controls went.”\n\nThe high-profile SUV already has been the focus of two recalls in August, one related to “unintended vehicle movement” while parked; the other involving seats that \"may not adequately restrain an occupant in a crash.\" In addition, consumer safely alerts from the company noted, vehicles may have instrument clusters that disable warning alerts and fail to display gear positions — drive, reverse, park, neutral. Federal safety regulations require gear positions to be displayed when a vehicle is not in park.\n\nFord Motor Co. confirmed this week that Aviators are being shipped from the Chicago Assembly Plant directly to dealers now, though the company acknowledged that a number of Aviators shipped 270 miles by truck to the Flat Rock Assembly Plant remain there for post-production troubleshooting.\n\nAn estimated 1,500 vehicles — 2020 Lincoln Aviator, 2020 Ford Explorer and Ford Police Interceptor — remained at or near the plant south of Detroit for quality review in recent days, sources close to the situation told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday. “The Aviators and police (vehicles) were tagged as ‘high priority’ back in mid-July, although there are still quite a few of those Lincolns,” one person on site said.\n\nMore:Mysterious problems disrupt delivery of 2020 Ford Explorer, Lincoln Aviator\n\nMore:2020 Lincoln Aviator SUV raises the bar for luxury, tech and features\n\nAngie Kozleski, Lincoln spokeswoman, said the company is following standard protocol.\n\n“As part of the launch of Lincoln Aviator, we were shipping vehicles to Flat Rock for additional quality checks and inspections. This is a longstanding practice at Ford Motor Co. with all-new vehicles to ensure that our vehicles are the highest possible quality for customers and we are taking every necessary action to ensure that the Aviator is built with the levels of quality and craftsmanship that our luxury customers expect,” she said. “There has been strong demand for the Lincoln Aviator, and we are working as quickly as possible to get these vehicles into the hands of Lincoln clients. The (new vehicle) changeover at the Chicago Assembly Plant where they are built was one of the most complex in the company’s history.”\n\nShe added, “Lincoln is committed to providing our customers with top quality vehicles. We are equally committed to addressing potential issues and responding quickly for our customers. We had two small recalls on Aviator since its launch and the majority of the affected vehicles were in dealer inventory and will be addressed prior to delivery to customers.”\n\nMore:2020 Lincoln Aviator SUV raises the bar for luxury, tech and features\n\nMore:iPhone is all you need to start, and drive, the 2020 Lincoln Aviator\n\nMore:New Lincoln Aviator SUV offers a smooth flight, 'like a bird'\n\nThe Aviator, with a highly praised design and smooth handling, is among \"the most impressive\" vehicles to debut in 2019, and has the potential to be a turning point for the Lincoln brand, said Mark Phelan, Free Press auto critic and former president of the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards.\n\nSoftware issues\n\nThe Free Press talked to consumers from the Midwest, the East Coast and the Deep South who shared issues of concern. One customer canceled an Aviator order, concerned after reading about owner experiences on social media sites.\n\nMany of the issues appear to be linked to software, which \"now controls more and more of the systems on today's vehicles,” said Consumer Reports' Fisher, who has spent two decades reviewing products. \"Sometimes there are bugs that aren't resolved in development. Manufacturers can't rely on consumers to find these bugs as some can compromise safety.”\n\nWhile new vehicles are increasingly high tech and complicated, Fisher added, “Consumers don't expect to have problems when they purchase a new car, and the majority of consumers won't see any.”\n\nBugs, black screen\n\nA Facebook page for Aviator owners talks of challenges and offers encouragement.\n\n“The transmission slipped into neutral when we were coasting up to a red light. When the light turned green, the engine just revved like the engine wasn’t in gear,” said a post from an owner identified as Richard Raz. “The infotainment system has a lot of bugs. The main screen has blacked out twice …”\n\nAviator owner Malcolm Hogan responded, “Hate to hear all these issues. They will get it addressed. Trust me, they are counting on this car to do well. They will be contacting the engineers and such. Ford is paying attention. They are not letting this go lightly.”\n\nHogan, 40, of Jacksonville, Florida, is a software business owner who purchased his Aviator Black Label for $80,000. He told the Free Press he has no official tie to Ford other than driving press cars to do freelance auto reviews.\n\nHe told the Free Press his Aviator steering wheel was off-center, a speaker grille on the ceiling had a clip that failed to snap into place and “it looked as if the windshield was replaced at the factory after production as the rain sensor and the windshield camera system did not work properly, which controlled other (features) on the car like the auto-high beams, lane-keep assist and road preview feature.”\n\nHe wrote, “Other than that, it has been a good vehicle thus far with about 1,200 miles on it. Also, it looks like that body panels are all aligned very well, which has been said to be a problem on a few earlier units.”\n\nHogan said he’s happy and confident nothing will go wrong in the future. “I do stay in contact with the lead engineer for the Aviator just chatting about features and mentioning the couple issues I had.”\n\n'What the hell?'\n\nMeanwhile, Laurel Spencer isn’t so sure.\n\n“I work a lot and I travel a lot. Winter is coming and I want a reliable car, especially if I’m going to drive three hours each way every week for business,” she said. “The majority of cars in our family have been Fords – Tauruses, Flexes, Edge, Explorer.”\n\nWhile her dealer tried to help and has serviced her car, it eventually referred her to Lincoln corporate. Spencer said she was irritated that the company offered her a break on car payments or an extended warranty.\n\n“I start backing out of the driveway and there’s water dripping on my kids’ heads. I mean, the vehicle hadn’t been at my house 24 hours. I call the sales guy and say, ‘Bill, what the hell?’ I’m like, OK, I work in manufacturing, stuff happens. But a week goes by and I have a colleague in the passenger seat and the seat belt doesn’t work. And I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ My colleague took Uber home.”\n\nLincoln told Spencer the seat belt problem was serious and to get the vehicle back for repair. Later, when she took the kids to a pumpkin patch, “the car starts acting a little goofy. The parking brake comes on while driving. The lights are going on, then the transmission light. It says, ‘major transmission fault, you need to call.’ Then this alarm goes off. When I call the dealer, they will take the car but I needed to wait as they had no loaner cars, so I wait.”\n\nThe repair manager at Highland Park Lincoln Ford did not return messages left on his voicemail by the Free Press.\n\n“I call the dealer and say, ‘Look, this is going on.' I’m going out of town ... and I’m like, 'Look, you guys need to fix this. I don’t want this car back until you’ve done every possible thing. I’m tired of being the guinea pig,'\" Spencer said. \"I said, ‘Can I drive the car?’ They say, ‘Don’t go on any major road trips.’ So I go to the grocery store by myself. Crash assist triggers, sirens go off, all these sirens. It's scary. I am afraid of what will happen and it happens in a split second. Warning lights go off, brakes go on. I was like, oh my gosh, and I pulled over.”\n\nShe emphasized, “All this is happening within 36 hours. They pick up the car and take it and try to work on it.” For weeks, the car was in the shop to address software and other issues, she said.\n\nWhile in the shop and after scrolling Aviator owner pages on social media, Spencer called her salesman to express her frustration again. He referred her case to Lincoln corporate. A Lincoln concierge representative tried reaching Spencer while she was in Switzerland, and Spencer couldn’t call back on an 800 number. Nearly a week after she returned, the car was ready.\n\n'I can't drive it ...'\n\n“I said, ‘Lou, I've just got to know, am I done?’ Have I gone through every single problem?” Spencer asked her dealer's technician. “He said, ‘We can’t guarantee that ... I said, ‘It’s a $70,000 car and a month and a half old and you can’t guarantee it? What do I do? I can’t drive it in the middle of winter and have it malfunction.\"\n\nWhen \"Kate\" from Lincoln concierge called, she asked if Spencer loved her amazing new SUV. And Spencer was just astonished.\n\n“I’m like, look, this doesn’t work for me,” Spencer said. “I don’t want to be on the side of the road with my kids and my car has a big problem. I don’t know that I can trust my vehicle. To me, it’s not about money. It’s about security and reliability. I’m in a newly built Lincoln and I should have peace of mind.”\n\nSo Spencer is planning to talk again with Lincoln about what can be done.\n\nFor now, Fisher has a bit of advice.\n\n“Clearly it’s better to figure out problems before vehicles go to the public,” he said. “Quick recalls mean fewer vehicles to fix later. But whatever you buy, do not be the first one on your block to own one.”\n\nWhy? He said all new cars can have bugs but Ford is known for introducing a whole bunch of new technology all at once, so if things go wrong the issues cascade. Toyota, for example, eases new features into products over time. “For Ford and Lincoln, these are complete redesigns, big large changes. And Ford tends to struggle on new technology in ways that Toyota and others do not. When you put a lot of new things into a vehicle all at once, it’s a recipe for problems.”\n\nConsumer Reports, with a database of more than half a million consumer vehicles, tests and monitors more vehicles than any other entity. Its 2017 Lincoln Continental purchased for $57,761 overheated on the way back from the dealership in October 2016.\n\nLincoln officials are optimistic about the potential for Aviator.\n\nMichael Sprague, Lincoln marketing director, said about 50% of first-month Aviator sales — August — were “conquests” of owners who had owned other luxury SUVs.\n\nIn fact, Spencer switched from driving a BMW to getting an Aviator, because she wanted an American luxury vehicle, she said.\n\nMore:Ford recalls F-150, Explorer, Expedition for seats may detach in crash\n\nMore:Ford recall: 2020 Explorer, Lincoln Aviator could roll because of crucial missing part\n\n“Aviators are just beginning to arrive in dealer showrooms. We will always do what is right to ensure we provide our customers a top quality vehicle and a great luxury experience with Lincoln,” Kozleski said. “We recognize the excitement of purchasing a new vehicle and the inconvenience if a client needs to bring it back, which is why we will pick up vehicles from clients ... and provide them with a Lincoln loaner.”\n\n'As long as it takes'\n\n“It is a longstanding process at the company to make updates to pre-production models based on all-new platforms before they are shipped to dealers,\" Kozleski explained. \"If a customer has a quality concern with their vehicle, they should contact their dealer or Lincoln concierge. Our dealers know their customers best and are working to handle any concern as a luxury customer would expect.”\n\nLincoln has some Aviators “undergoing additional quality inspections at Flat Rock,” Kozleski confirmed. “There are some Explorers that were built earlier in the process that are undergoing additional quality inspections in Flat Rock. We are shipping vehicles to dealers as we complete our quality inspection process.”\n\nFord plans to ramp up its operations in Chicago while continuing to perform quality inspections in Flat Rock “as long as it takes,” Kozleski said.\n\nShe was not aware of specific experiences described by Spencer or other customers in official online public Aviator forums.\n\nKozleski encouraged the Free Press to interview a happy Aviator owners.\n\nDriving to Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nRobert Rood, 72, of Canton is a retired auto parts sales manager who paid $58,000 for his Aviator and took delivery in early August.\n\n\"I love it. I've had no problems,\" he said. \"I’ve got 9,300 miles on my vehicle. I just got back from a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert in Orange Beach, Alabama.\"\n\nBob Ventrone, 64, a financial consultant from Jacksonville, Florida, said he took delivery of his $79,000 Aviator on Sept. 9. \"I have 1,000 miles and no issues at all. The car is great.\"\n\nKozleski said Lincoln is committed to its customers and the team poured its heart into the Aviator.\n\n\"Lincoln has made really great strides in quality over the years and in fact, this year Lincoln was among the top 5 brands in J.D. Power Initial Quality Study,\" she said.\n\nLate Wednesday, Spencer was trying to stay positive.\n\n\"I am concerned and apprehensive,\" she said. \"I don’t know if the problems are finished or if I am going to be driving in the middle of I-94 and my new car breaks down.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard at 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

That’s despite a county driving ban put in place during the storm.\n\nLia Belles’ 85-year-old grandmother and her father were among the stranded.\n\nThey have been stuck on New York State Route 198 in Buffalo – less than a mile from her home – since Friday afternoon. Contact with them is limited due to their phone battery, and they have been turning the heat on and off to save gas.\n\n“There is nothing more I want other than their safety right now,” Belles told CNN Saturday, adding that her dad could walk home but he would never leave his mother alone.\n\n“I’ve tried to walk out to them with a sled but conditions by myself were just impossible,” she said.\n\nBelles said by Saturday afternoon they got help getting the car unstuck but there was no path for them to leave.\n\n“It’s very nerve racking and difficult,” she said. “They’re definitely exhausted, but we’re seeing a little hope right now.”\n\nIn hardest-hit areas, many emergency crews that tried to reach the stranded became stuck themselves, Poloncarz said.\n\n“Don’t leave your home,” Poloncarz said on CNN Saturday to anyone thinking about traveling to or within the area. “It’s much safer to be inside, even if you lost your power with it only being 45 degrees inside, than going out and dealing with minus 20 wind chills and blinding conditions.”\n\nNational Guard troops were arriving Saturday to “rescue people that are stuck in vehicles,” and to give rides to medical workers so they could relieve colleagues who’d been working at hospitals for more than a day, Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo Diocese Bishop Michael W. Fisher on Saturday urged churches to livestream Christmas Mass because of the severe weather.\n\n“Although it is Christmas, in these dangerous conditions, no one should put themselves or others at risk,” he said via Twitter.\n\nEven where it wasn’t snowing and howling, temperatures and wind chills have been dangerously low across much of the country.\n\nFrom the Plains and the Midwest to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and even in parts of the Southeast, wind chills after the sun rose Saturday morning were below zero, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThat included:\n\n• Atlanta: 9 degrees; with minus 8 wind chill\n\n• Memphis: 10 degrees; with minus 4 wind chill\n\n• New York City: 8 degrees; with minus 8 wind chill\n\n• St. Louis: 9 degrees; with minus 12 wind chill\n\n• Washington, DC: 12 degrees; with minus 3 wind chill\n\nAt least 22 people have died since Wednesday across seven states, a result of dangerous and life-threatening conditions this week over a large swath of the country:\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building possibly looking for warmth, and another in a transient camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Kansas Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died in the state, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle accident in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a caravan slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New York: Erie County has had three storm-related deaths, county officials said Saturday. Two died in separate incidents Friday night when emergency medical personnel could not get to their homes in time for medical emergencies, Poloncarz said Saturday morning. Details about the third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n• Ohio: Eight people have died as a result of weather-related auto accidents, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75, when a semi tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• Tennessee: The Tennessee Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Wisconsin: Wisconsin State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports.

At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas. Eleven abandoned ambulances were dug out Sunday, officials said.\n\nSee houses frozen over by massive winter storm 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n“We had to send specialized rescue crews to go get the rescuers,” Poloncarz told “CNN This Morning” Monday, adding it was the worst storm he could remember. “It was just horrendous, and it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\n“We’re used to snow here, we can handle snow,” he said. “But with the wind, the blinding views – it was complete whiteouts – and the extreme cold, it was some of the worst conditions that any of us have ever seen.”\n\nSnow covers downtown Buffalo, New York, on Monday, December 26, 2022, in this photo from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's Twitter page. Gov. Kathy Hochul/Twitter/AP\n\nThe storm has drawn widespread comparisons to Buffalo’s famous blizzard of 1977. Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasts show an additional 8 to 16 inches of snow could fall, according to the National Weather Service. Erie County could see another 4 to 8 inches and is under a winter weather advisory.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nStorm leads to loss of life across multiple states\n\nOver the past week, the prolonged winter storm has enveloped a large swath of the country with dangerously low temperatures and wind chills, also bringing with it widespread power outages and thousands of canceled flights.\n\nAbout 25,700 customers were without power Monday evening in New York and Maine, according to PowerOutage.US. Since the start of the storm, the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nElectricity was not the sole utility impacted: Jackson, Mississippi, issued a boil water notice Sunday after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks “likely caused by the weather,” officials said on Facebook. The city – which just two months ago overcame a separate lengthy water crisis – distributed water to residents throughout Christmas Day.\n\nThe storm also snarled travel in the US during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday and more than 3,100 canceled on Christmas.\n\nAbout 3,800 flights into or out of US airports have been canceled as of 7 p.m. ET Monday, according to tracking site FlightAware. The total includes more than 2,500 flights canceled by Southwest Airlines, according to FlightAware.\n\nSouthwest said in a statement: “With consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us, continuing challenges are impacting our Customers and Employees in a significant way that is unacceptable.\n\n“And our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning.”\n\nAnother 7,000 US flights have been delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nSeparately, the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, which closed Friday due to “hazardous weather conditions” and saw 43 inches of snow, is expected to remain closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said on Twitter. The closure means the Buffalo Sabres’ NHL game at Columbus will be postponed because the team cannot fly to Ohio, Sabres officials said.\n\nSnow blankets a neighborhood, December 25, 2022, in Buffalo, New York. Carolyn Thompson/AP\n\nSince the brutal weather’s arrival, multiple storm-related deaths have been reported across several states. In addition to the deaths in New York, the fatalities include:\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building possibly looking for warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died in the state, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a Caravan slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people have died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75, when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\nWhat to expect as storm moves away\n\nA person clears snow-covered roads with a backhoe loader in Buffalo, New York, United States on December 26, 2022. Faith Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe powerful system continues to move away from the Northeast, yet many cities and towns remain covered with thick snow. Over separate 24-hour spans, Baraga, Michigan, received 42.8 inches of snow while Henderson Harbor, New York, got 40.8 inches.\n\nIn the meantime, lake-effect snows will continue to make for hazardous travel conditions for the next couple of days and conditions are expected to slowly improve over the week.\n\nLingering lake-effect snows blowing downwind from the Great Lakes will slowly become less intense, but the Arctic air enveloping much of the eastern half of the nation will be slow to moderate, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe low-pressure system is forecast to move farther away into Canada, while another system quickly across the northern US into Monday, bringing snow from the northern Plains through the Midwest.\n\nMuch of the rest of the eastern part of the country will still be in a deep freeze through Monday before a moderating trend sets in on Tuesday, forecasters said.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct where Gov.

What to know the town\n\n'Why are people getting sick?': East Palestine residents voice concerns; Norfolk Southern skips meeting\n\nAbout 4,700 people live in East Palestine. The other Ohio cities and suburbs along the train’s likely route have populations between 28,000 to 370,000.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what impact the derailment would have had if it had happened along those more populous stretch tracks slicing through Cuyahoga, Summit, Portage or Stark counties, but many thousands of people could have been evacuated instead of the hundreds that were in rural Ohio.\n\nVinyl chloride and the other hazardous materials on the derailed train in Ohio\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine said local communities were not told that 11 of the train's 50 cars contained vinyl chloride, a highly flammable gas used to make PVC pipes, credit cards and other plastic things.\n\nVinyl chloride is more dangerous per part than ammonia and natural gas, according to federal regulations that dictate acceptable levels in the air. When officials decided that a controlled burn was the only way to prevent an explosion, they warned the fire would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air.\n\nPhosgene is a highly toxic, colorless gas with a strong odor that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I. Hydrogen chloride is a colorless to yellowish gas with a strong odor, and its primary effect on humans is skin, eye, nose and throat irritation.\n\nDeWine called on federal lawmakers to re-examine whether state or local officials should be alerted before trains carry hazardous materials before their communities.\n\nWhere was the train that derailed in East Palestine coming from and going to?\n\nBefore it derailed, the train appeared to be on a routine run. It started in Madison, Illinois, near the Missouri border and was headed to Conway, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb that is home to one of the largest rail yards in the U.S.\n\nThe 613-mile journey between Madison, Illinois, and Conway, Pennsylvania, is nearly a straight shot by car. You’d hop on I-70 in Illinois and head east, passing through Indianapolis and Columbus before landing in Pittsburgh’s suburbs.\n\nBut the freight train route is more complicated, with possible stops to load and unload along the way. Norfolk-Southern’s website shows a web of its tracks criss-crossing Ohio.\n\nA Norfolk-Southern spokesman said Wednesday that it would take time to turn over the exact path the train followed Feb. 3, pointing out that rail transportation is more complicated than airline flight paths, which keep routine schedules.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is investigating the crash, confirmed Wednesday that the train traveled along Norfolk-Southern’s main tracks and that the “crew operating at the time of the accident went on duty in Toledo.”\n\nThe most direct route from Toledo would put the train on tracks that run along Lake Erie to Cleveland, where it could have picked up tracks heading southeast, according to a rail map posted on Norfolk-Southern’s website.\n\nFrom there, the train would have passed through Macedonia, Hudson, Kent and Hartville, before taking another track in Alliance that runs to the east.\n\nEvidence of train on fire in Salem\n\nFootage showing a fiery axle 20 miles before East Palestine train derailment raises questions about alert timing\n\nBy the time the train entered Salem, one of its car axle's appeared to be on fire.\n\nCameras at businesses along that section of rail showed the train appearing to travel at least 20 miles with a malfunctioning axle, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nAt 8:12 p.m. Feb 3, a camera at Butech Bliss showed the bottom of one freight car glowing brightly as it passed by, the paper reported. A minute later and about a mile east, a camera at a meat processing plant captured an axle aflame.\n\nThe train derailed about 18 miles from Salem in East Palestine.\n\nThe NTSB has said it suspects a mechanical issue with a rail car axle ultimately caused the derailment.\n\nWhy can't the public track hazardous materials traveling by train?\n\nTrain enthusiasts and some local leaders say the routes of trains carrying hazardous materials aren't shared publicly to prevent terrorists or others from trying to weaponize the hazardous materials.\n\nIn Ravenna, Mayor Frank Seman said trains rumble through the area many times a day so he wasn't surprised to find out that the train that derailed in East Palestine may have passed through his community.\n\n\"We have no idea what's on those tracks when they go by,\" he said. \"They don't go off the tracks very often, but now we've had two.\"\n\nIn November, a train derailed off South Prospect Street in Ravenna Township along a Norfolk-Southern Line. It was carrying new vehicles and rock salt.\n\nWhile the wreck happened outside the city, the tracks run close to Crystal Lake and Muzzy Lake, two bodies of water owned by the city. Rail cars were pulled off the track and were sitting on private property for weeks after the incident, and the damage still has not been completely cleaned up.\n\nNearby in Hudson − another city where the rail tracks pass − City Manager Tom Sheridan said Hudson City Council members on Tuesday directed him to look into adding air quality and ground water testing into the city's emergency operations plan.\n\nThe next day, about 63 miles away in East Palestine, officials were already telling people there that city water was safe to drink. DeWine tweeted that the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency was \"confident that the municipal water is safe to drink\" in East Palestine after the latest water testing results showed \"no detection of contaminants.\"\n\nYet many in and around the Columbiana County community this week remained skeptical, frustrated and afraid.\n\nDerailment in more populous areas possible\n\nWhat would have happened if the derailment happened earlier?\n\n“It’s a really hard question,” said Thomas Smoot, director of Summit County’s emergency management agency. “All of those areas…are different. Some have rural areas in them. Others are more populated.”\n\nSummit County’s EMA is part of the same emergency management region – Region 5 – as East Palestine and is one of only a few in the with a Type 1 team, able to handle all hazardous materials, he said.\n\nSmoot said at least four Summit County chiefs and assistant chiefs have been to New Palestine to help.\n\nSmoot said EMA train with railroads and with cars like the ones involved for just such disasters. He pointed out that many manufacturers in Summit County and throughout Northeast Ohio use hazardous materials.\n\nIn 2018, an explosion at Emerald Performance Materials just south of Summit Lake in Akron prompted a half-mile evacuation in South Akron near Kenmore. In the end, no one was injured and people could return to the area after about six hours.\n\nSmoot hoped people learn from the train derailment and listen to local incident commanders when incidents like the explosion or train derailment happen.\n\n\"They don't want anyone to perish, to die or get further injured,\" Smoot said. \"They are doing their job to get you out of there.\"\n\nBeacon Journal reporter Derek Kreider and Record-Courier reporter Diane Smith contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/us/highland-park-illinois-shooting-july-fourth-parade-tuesday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Highland Park parade shooting suspect charged with 7 counts of ...", "text": "Highland Park, Illinois CNN —\n\nThe suspect in Monday’s mass shooting at a July 4th parade in Highland Park, Illinois, that left seven dead and injured more than two dozen has been charged with seven counts of first-degree murder, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart announced during a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\nIf Robert E. Crimo III, 21, is convicted, the charges could lead to a mandatory life sentence, Rinehart said. More charges are expected to come, Rinehart said, including attempted murder, aggravated discharge and aggravated battery charges.\n\n“These are just the first of many charges that will be filed against Mr. Crimo, I want to emphasize that,” Rinehart said, adding he anticipates “dozens of more charges centering around each of the victims.”\n\nCrimo has been in police custody since being apprehended Monday evening.\n\n“Tomorrow morning at the Lake County courthouse, we will ask a judge to hold Mr. Crimo without the possibility of bail,” Rinehart said.\n\nAttorney Thomas Durkin confirmed to CNN his representation of Crimo.\n\nAttorney Steve Greenberg has been retained to represent Crimo’s parents, Greenberg confirmed to CNN Tuesday evening in an email. The attorney released a statement on Twitter on behalf of the suspect’s parents.\n\n“We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the paradegoers, the community, and our own. Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to everybody,” the statement read.\n\nPolice earlier Tuesday identified six of the seven victims killed in the shooting.\n\nJennifer Banek, Lake County Coroner, read the list of names during the news conference. The victims are as follows:\n\n64-year-old Katherine Goldstein of Highland Park\n\n35-year-old Irina McCarthy of Highland Park\n\n37-year-old Kevin McCarthy of Highland Park\n\n63-year-old Jacquelyn Sundheim of Highland Park\n\n88-year-old Stephen Straus of Highland Park\n\n78-year-old Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza of Morelos, Mexico\n\nA seventh victim died at a hospital outside of Lake County, Banek said.\n\nA total of 45 people died or were injured during the shooting, said Christopher Covelli, spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force.\n\nThe focus of the investigation for the last 36 hours was on the shooter, but has now shifted to “the victims and those left behind,” Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said during the news conference.\n\nThe release of the victims’ names comes after investigators revealed the suspected gunman may have planned the attack “for several weeks” and wore women’s clothing during the shooting to conceal his identity and his facial tattoos, and to help him leave with the crowd that was fleeing in the shooting’s wake, Covelli said.\n\nThis photo released by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force is said to be of Robert E. Crimo III dressed in women's clothing. Lake County Major Crime Task Force\n\n“He blended right in with everybody else as they were running around, almost as (if) he was an innocent spectator as well,” Covelli said late Tuesday morning at a news conference outside Highland Park police headquarters.\n\nCovelli also revealed Tuesday that Crimo had two prior incidents with law enforcement. In April 2019, an individual contacted authorities about Crimo attempting suicide. Authorities spoke with Crimo and his parents, and the matter was handled by mental health professionals, Covelli said.\n\nThen, in September 2019, a family member reported that Crimo threatened “to kill everyone” and had a collection of knives, Covelli said. Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from their residence. Highland Park police reported the incident to Illinois State Police.\n\n“At that time there was no probable cause to arrest. There were no complaints that were signed by any of the victims,” Covelli said.\n\nShortly after the September incident, Crimo legally purchased five firearms – a combination of rifles, a pistol and possibly a shotgun – between 2020 and 2021, according to Covelli. In order to buy firearms in Illinois, individuals need a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card. Crimo was under 21, so he was sponsored by his father, state police said in a news release. Crimo’s application was not denied because there was “insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger” at the time.\n\nInvestigators still are trying to determine a motive for Monday’s shooting, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo, authorities believe, used a high-powered rifle “similar to an AR-15” to fire more than 70 rounds into a parade crowd from a business’s roof, which he accessed by a fire escape’s ladder, Covelli said.\n\nSounds of gunshots pierced the sunny parade just after 10 a.m. CT along the town’s Central Avenue, about 25 miles north of Chicago, sending hundreds of attendees scattering in terror – abandoning strollers, chairs and American-flag paraphernalia on the streets. Witnesses described watching in horror as injured people dropped around them.\n\nLive updates: Suspect in custody\n\nOfficers work the scene after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nThe carnage punctuates an already bloody American spring and summer – during the past 186 days, more than 300 mass shootings have happened in the US, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking such incidents.\n\n“There are no words for the kind of evil that shows up at a public celebration of freedom, hides on a roof and shoots innocent people with an assault rifle,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday. “It is devastating that a celebration of America was ripped apart by our uniquely American plague.”\n\nDetails on what led investigators to believe the shooting was planned for weeks were not immediately made available.\n\nRobert E. Crimo III is arrested in this photo obtained by CNN. obtained by CNN\n\nAfter the shooting, Crimo went to his mother’s house in the area, and then took off in his mother’s car, Covelli said.\n\nAfter police determined Crimo was a person of interest in the investigation and publicized his information and the car they believed he was in, someone saw the vehicle on US 41 and called 911, Covelli said.\n\nA North Chicago police officer then saw the vehicle, waited for backup, stopped the car Monday evening near Lake Forest, Illinois, and arrested Crimo, authorities said.\n\nSuspect bought the weapons legally in the Chicagoland area, police say\n\nBesides the rifle used in the shooting, which authorities found abandoned near the shooting scene, officers also found a rifle inside the vehicle, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo, a resident of the city of Highwood, near Highland Park, had purchased both weapons legally in the Chicagoland area, Covelli said, without elaborating.\n\nOther firearms were found in Crimo’s Highwood residence, Covelli said.\n\nInvestigators have no information that the shooting was motivated by race, religion or any other protected status, Covelli said.\n\nAmong the seven people killed, five adults died at the scene and one in hospital, Lake County Coroner Jennifer Banek said. It is not yet clear how old the sixth and seventh victims were.\n\nOne of those killed was Jacki Sundheim, 63, according to a nearby synagogue where she was a congregant and a staff member. Another was Nicolas Toledo, 78, who had been visiting his family in Highland Park from Mexico, an official from the state of Morelos told CNN.\n\nThirty-nine patients relating to the shooting – including the person who died in a hospital – were treated at three NorthShore University HealthSystem hospitals, the system said Tuesday.\n\nThe injured ranged in age from 8 to 85 – four or five patients were children, Dr. Brigham Temple, the system’s medical director, said Monday.\n\nNine still were in hospitals Tuesday, ranging in age from 14 to the 70s, according to system spokesman Jim Anthony. Eight of the nine suffered gunshot wounds, Anthony said. One was in critical condition Tuesday, Anthony said.\n\n‘We’re all a little shaken’\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a Highland Park street still was littered Tuesday with revelers’ belongings that were abandoned in haste, and residents are struggling to come to terms with what happened.\n\nThree blocks of Central Avenue in downtown Highland Park remained blocked by police tape. FBI agents walked in a line to comb the street for more evidence and lifted up strewn lawn chairs, and other items left behind in the flight to safety.\n\nMembers of the FBI's evidence response team walk the scene one day after a mass shooting in downtown Highland Park, Illinois, on Tuesday.

They’d abandoned the wheelchair Monday – and the younger sibling carried his brother – after the elder fell out as they hurried away from the shooting.\n\n“We’re all a little shaken. It’s hard to believe this happened, and only (yesterday). And I think we’re all a little shaky and unsettled, (is) probably the best way to describe it,” the father, Paul Toback, told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday.\n\nBoth inside and outside the taped-off zone, belongings of parade visitors remained strewn on the ground. Among them: a baby carriage, a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee overrun by ants, a half-eaten cup of noodles, a toy truck, sunscreen, bottles of water, dog treats, and a stuffed Sonic the Hedgehog toy.\n\n‘Much more work to do’\n\nLast year was the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014. There were a total of 692 mass shootings in the US in 2021, the non-profit says.\n\nThe Highland Park attack comes after several recent mass shootings that shocked the nation, including an 18-year-old’s racist attack at a New York supermarket that killed 10 and another 18-year-old’s shooting at a Texas school that left 19 students and two teachers dead.\n\nHighland Park resident Murry Rosenbush is reflected in a store window Tuesday as he removes items left behind by attendees to the town's Fourth of July parade. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nIn the wake of those massacres, President Joe Biden signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\nBiden held a brief moment of silence at the White House on Monday evening during a July Fourth picnic, noting that he’d spoken to Gov. Pritzker and Highland Park’s mayor.\n\n“There is much more work to do, and I’m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence,” Biden said in a statement released Monday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Highland Park Tuesday after delivering a speech at the National Education Association earlier in the day.\n\n“We’re here for you and we stand with you,” Harris said, adding that the administration would continue to offer federal assistance. “We’ve got to be smarter as a country, in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons.”\n\nIn 2013, Highland Park had passed a local ban on semi-automatic firearms with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition, following a series of mass shooting incidents around the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mayor Rotering said Monday’s shooting showed a need for strict gun laws nationally.\n\n“I think it’s important to know that our assault weapons ban … is reflective of the values of our community,” she said. “Obviously we have a problem in this country if we have weekly mass shootings involving these weapons of war, and it’s important for us to talk about how to provide that protection on a broader scale, whether it’s statewide (or) whether it’s nationally.”\n\nThe scene following a shooting in Highland Park on July 4. Network Video Productions\n\nWhat we know about the suspect\n\nFormer classmates described Crimo Tuesday as an odd, soft-spoken kid who didn’t participate in class or school activities and showed little interest in engaging with his peers.\n\nThe few friends Crimo had tended to be troublemakers who seemed to relish the notion of being outsiders, a couple of his former classmates said.\n\n“They wanted to be the ‘anti-’ group, like the rebels,” said Mackenzie, a former middle school classmate who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her privacy. “The aura they presented was opposite, negative and harsh.”\n\nOther classmates, who wished not to be identified, described Crimo as a skater kid who made DIY skateboard videos on YouTube all the time.\n\nJust before Crimo dropped out of Highland Park High in 2017, he splattered “Awake” stickers in the school’s stairways and bathrooms, the former classmate said. Crimo made music under the name “Awake the Rapper.”\n\nOn Monday, Covelli said law enforcement officials “processed a significant amount of digital evidence,” which helped investigators identify Crimo as the suspect.\n\nCrimo posted online music videos on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website, with some featuring animated scenes of gun violence.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter – resembling Crimo’s appearance – is seen in tactical gear carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo is seen narrating, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.”\n\nThe suspect’s uncle, Paul A. Crimo, told CNN he had spoken at length to law enforcement on Monday and described his nephew as a “lonely, quiet person.”\n\nHe said he does not know of any political views held by his nephew, though he described him as active on YouTube.\n\nHis brother, who is the suspect’s father, ran for mayor against incumbent Rotering in 2019 and lost.\n\n“I’m so heartbroken for all the families who lost their lives,” Paul Crimo said.\n\nRotering knew the suspect, having been leader of his Cub Scout pack when he was a boy. “He was a Cub Scout in my … pack. So, many years ago, he was just a … quiet little boy that I knew,” Rotering told CNN Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t know what got him to this point, but let’s ask that question of so many people,” she said.\n\nStories of terror\n\nWitnesses told stories of sheer terror following the shooting in the affluent Chicago suburb.\n\nSome bystanders initially thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks, until many fled in terror.\n\nEyewitnesses described grabbing their children and families and running for their lives, some hiding behind dumpsters or in nearby stores for safety amid the chaos. One paradegoer described seeing someone shot and killed, another saw a man shot in the ear with blood all over his face.\n\nBarbara Medina told CNN Tuesday her arm was broken during the stampede when bullets rained down on the parade. She was marching in the parade holding the banner for Community Partners for Affordable Housing (CPAH) when she heard gunshots ring out.\n\nA sea of people rushed toward her, so she dropped the banner, grabbed her 7-year-old daughter Caroline and her scooter and ran. She was separated from her 12-year-old son and her father in the chaos.\n\nMedina fled down an alley and noticed her daughter slowing down behind her. She reached back to grab her and help her along, but tripped on her scooter and fell hard on her left arm. She knew immediately it was broken.\n\n“I could see it went the wrong way, and I had to kind of maneuver it back. It was very painful,” she said.\n\nShe eventually made it to a stranger’s home, where she learned her son and his father were safe and sheltering elsewhere.\n\nMedina borrowed a sling and an ice pack and propped her arm up on some pillows to relieve the pain. Hours later, she went to a local non-trauma hospital to get her arm set and said doctors diagnosed her with a broken proximal radius just below the elbow. She now has a cast from the tips of her fingers to the top of her shoulder and expects to be in a cast for six to eight weeks.\n\nJonathan Birnberg, 41, told CNN Tuesday he attended the parade this year with his wife, 9-year-old son and 7-year-old twins.\n\n“The parade is a big tradition and didn’t happen the last two years, so everyone was really excited. There’s a carnival after and fireworks tonight, and there was excitement about bringing those traditions back,” Birnberg said.\n\nWhen the gunfire began, he said nobody moved at first, unaware of the meaning of the noise. During a second round of shots, though, he said he saw people running down the street, and so he and his family began to run in the same direction. He ducked into a coffee shop and, after regrouping with his whole family, fled to a neighbor’s house for safety along with a large group of other children and parents.\n\nMaggie Schmieder, 40, attended Monday’s parade with family and friends. She described the moments after the shooting more as “chaotic calm” than terror or panic.\n\n“People weren’t like sprinting or diving down,” she said. “It was like there was this confusion, but people automatically started going.”\n\nShe and her family fled the area and eventually made their way to their car before driving away from the scene safely.\n\nSchmieder works as a teacher and said she has prepared for a mass shooting at her school.\n\n“I always feared that this could happen at work. I naively, truly never thought that it would happen here, and certainly not at a crowded public event with a celebration,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Adrienne Broaddus Helen Regan", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Adrienne Broaddus", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Investigators are working to identify a specific flour brand.\n\nAs of Thursday, the outbreak had reached 11 states. Twelve illnesses and three hospitalizations have been reported so far, the CDC said.\n\n\"Flour doesn’t look like a raw food, but most flour is raw. This means that it hasn’t been treated to kill germs that cause food poisoning,\" the CDC wrote. \"Any raw (unbaked) flour used to make dough or batter can be contaminated with germs like Salmonella, but Salmonella germs are killed when flour is cooked or baked.\"\n\nPeople can get sick from eating or tasting uncooked dough or batter, the CDC says.\n\nIn the current multi-state Salmonella outbreak, \"most people reported eating raw dough or batter made with flour before they got sick,\" the CDC wrote – adding that flour \"was the only common ingredient\" that people reported eating.\n\nSalmonella outbreak prompts recall:Oysters recalled after salmonella outbreak sickens people in three southeastern states\n\nShould you ask ChatGPT for medical advice? We asked an expert – and ChatGPT.\n\nIs Salmonella making me sick? How common are infections?\n\nA Salmonella infection is a common bacterial disease that impacts the intestinal tract, the Mayo Clinic notes. The germ lives in animal and human intestines – and most often causes infections in people through eating contaminated food or water.\n\nEven eating a small amount of uncooked dough or batter with raw flour – or other ingredients that may contain Salmonella, like uncooked eggs – can make you sick, the CDC says.\n\nTo avoid potential Salmonella infections from raw flour or eggs, the CDC urges people to not eat uncooked dough or batter, follow all proper cooking/baking instructions and clean every utensil that touched those ingredients.\n\nUndercooked meat and unpasteurized milk can also cause Salmonella infections, the Mayo Clinic notes. Beyond eating food, people can become ill from Salmonella after touching infected animals, the CDC says.\n\n'Don’t kiss or snuggle your bearded dragons':CDC says lizards behind salmonella infections\n\nThe CDC estimates that Salmonella causes about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year.\n\nSalmonella infection symptoms\n\nMost healthy people recover from Salmonella infections. But it's important to know the symptoms – in case more serious complications arise.\n\nThe timeline of symptoms can vary. According to the CDC, signs of illness usually begin sometime between six hours and six days after swallowing the bacteria.\n\nCommon symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, chills and headache, the Mayo Clinic says. Most people recover without treatment within a few days to a week.\n\nSeverity of illness from Salmonella infections ranges. Some patients will experience no symptoms, while others can develop life-threatening complications \"if the infection spreads beyond the intestines\" the Mayo Clinic says.\n\nStudy:More than half a million UTIs linked to contaminated meat in US each year\n\nHealth:Cases of tick-borne illness, babesiosis, are rising – here's how to stay safe\n\nAgain, most healthy people will recover from Salmonella infections without treatment.

Most who get sick from salmonella develop symptoms as soon as six hours and as long as six days after infection. Patients may develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. More severe cases may include aches, headaches, elevated fever, lethargy, rashes, blood in the urine or stool and in some instances may become fatal.\n\nThe CDC estimates Salmonella cause about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year.\n\nSalmonella is killed by heat when flour is baked, fried or otherwise cooked, General Mills notes in details about the recall on its website.

During washing, chicken juices can spread in the kitchen and contaminate other foods, utensils, and countertops.\n\nUse a separate cutting board for raw chicken.\n\nNever place cooked food or fresh produce on a plate, cutting board, or other surface that previously held raw chicken.\n\nWash cutting boards, utensils, dishes, and countertops with hot soapy water after preparing chicken and before you prepare the next item.\n\nUse a food thermometer to make sure chicken is cooked to a safe internal temperature of 165°F.\n\nIf cooking frozen raw chicken in a microwavable meal, handle it as you would fresh raw chicken. Follow cooking directions carefully to prevent food poisoning.\n\nIf you think the chicken you are served at a restaurant or anywhere else is not fully cooked, send it back for more cooking.\n\nRefrigerate or freeze leftover chicken within two hours (or within one hour if the temperature outside is higher than 90°F).\n\nFollow Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nPlant-based protein:Burger King plans to release plant-based Impossible Whopper nationwide by end of year\n\nBaby sleeper recall:Kids II recalls 700,000 baby sleepers including Ingenuity and Bright Starts brands", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/26/fda-new-safety-rules-imported-food/2587391/", "title": "FDA issues new safety rules for imported food", "text": "Elizabeth Weise\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFDA proposes new rules that require food importers to meet the same safety standards as U.S. food producers\n\nCurrently FDA has little oversight over importers beyond inspecting about 2%25 of food coming into the country\n\nThe rules are part of the landmark Food Safety Modernization Act signed into law in 2011\n\nAlthough one-sixth of America's food is imported, including 50% of the fresh fruit and 20% of the fresh vegetables, the Food and Drug Administration inspects only 2% of imports. That began to change Friday when the agency issued long-awaited rules that require imported food to meet the same safety standards as food produced in the United States.\n\nToday \"produce comes to our border without us having any enforceable standards in place for the conditions under which the produce was grown or for water quality and employee hygiene. And there's no way for us to hold the importer accountable for the safety of the product they're bringing in,\" said Michael Taylor,FDA's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine.\n\nOnce the rules take effect, importers will be responsible for proving to FDA that the food they import was produced and packed under conditions that prevent food safety problems.\n\n\"Imported food is such an important part of our food system that you can't really have an effective food safety system at FDA without these new regulations,\" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe proposed rules are part of the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2011. They will also create an auditing system to insure that foreign food producers and packers adhere to U.S. safety standards.\n\nImported food is responsible for a disproportionate number of food-borne illnesses. According to the food safety program at the Pew Charitable Trusts, eight of the 19 reported multi-state food-borne illness outbreaks linked to FDA-regulated products since 2011 were from imports. The foods included pomegranate seeds, tahini sesame paste, cucumbers, ricotta salata cheese, mangoes, raw tuna, pine nuts and papayas.\n\nImported foods that are eaten raw are especially dangerous because other nations often have endemic diseases unknown in the United States. \"We're not only importing their food, we're also importing their health problems,\" DeWaal said.\n\nThe CDC is currently investigating an outbreak of cyclospora that has sickened 285 people in multiple states and sent 18 to the hospital. The stomach bug causes vomiting and diarrhea and is common in tropical regions. A 1999 outbreak that sickened over 1,400 people in the United States and Canada was traced to imported raspberries from Guatemala. The cause of the current outbreak has not yet been determined.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 153 people in nine states had contracted hepatitis A, a liver disease, by eating a frozen berry mix that contained pomegranate seeds from Turkey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sixty-six of them were hospitalized.\n\nBrian Kennedy, with the Grocery Manufacturers Association in Washington, D.C., said the new rules were another step forward toward implementation of FSMA, a \"landmark law\" that \"ensures that prevention is the cornerstone of our nation's food safety strategy.\"\n\nFDA will accept public comment for four months and then incorporate the feedback into the rules, which are expected to be published in final form and take effect in 2015.\n\nThe new rules will \"create a level playing field\" for U.S. food producers that now have to compete with overseas growers and packers who don't always operate under the same high level of safety required here, Taylor said.\n\nGMA's Kennedy called the rules \"a role model for what can be achieved when the private and public sectors work together to achieve a common goal.\"\n\nThe requirements are often as simple as making sure water used to wash greens is not contaminated with manure and that people working in packing sheds have access to toilets and a place to wash their hands, said Erik Olson, director of food safety programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\n\"Some of that is supposed to be already required under voluntary standard.

For example, Salinas, Calif., is also a big romaine-producing area. People also should avoid salad mixes that include romaine.\n\nThis strain of bacteria, called E. coli O157:H7, produces Shiga toxin, according to the CDC. It can produce STX1 and STX2, but those that produce only STX2 -- which is what's happening with this outbreak -- tend to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople who contract Shiga toxin-producing E. coli get sick an average of three to four days after they've swallowed the tainted food, the CDC said. The common symptoms are diarrhea, which often is bloody; severe stomach cramps; and vomiting. The majority of people get better within a week, though more severe cases last longer\n\nThe bacteria can spread through ruminants, animals like cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, elk, and deer; water; the environment and people, Dr. Robert Tauxe , director of CDC’s Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, said previously.\n\nThe only source found for the outbreak so far is Harrison Farms, which supplied only the whole-head romaine lettuce to a correctional facility in Alaska.

In that case, the E. coli was traced back to a grower located near a stream not far from a cow pasture.

But the border issue’s emergence in discussion provides a window into a complex policy and political moment.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat who has long pressed the administration to terminate Title 42, is far from alone. Administration officials have received a steady stream of calls from lawmakers as well as state and local officials, reflecting often sharply divergent views on the merits of the authority, people familiar with the matter said. The calls, however, all echoed consistent concerns about the termination of Title 42 and what it will mean along the border in recent weeks.\n\nIt’s a dynamic that has played out as the Biden administration intensively prepares for a moment officials have long grappled with how to navigate. To some degree, it’s the latest phase of an effort that has long been underway, with officials keenly aware since the opening days in office that at some point the pandemic-era policy would come to an end. Personnel and technology infrastructure have been directed to key entry points, with increased levels and resources expected to be announced in the days ahead.\n\nAsked about concerns inside the administration about the potential for a surge at the border once Title 42 goes away, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre listed off a series of personnel, processing and infrastructure efforts that have been put into place.\n\n“We’re going to do the work, we’re going to be prepared, and we’re going to make sure we have a humane process moving forward,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at the White House briefing.\n\nStill, the cross-cutting viewpoints on border policy have converged with the significant diplomatic component tied to managing a rapid shift in the countries of origin of the migrants apprehended at the border, one that has added a new layer of difficulty for the administration.\n\nThroughout, administration officials have stressed that the only viable long-term solution will come from congressional action, noting encouragement with a bipartisan framework released in the Senate last week.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the discussions, however, the long-shot bipartisan immigration deal led by Sens. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently announced that she is leaving the Democratic party and registering as an independent, is essentially dead this Congress.\n\nThe framework, which would have extended protections for Dreamers and extended Title 42, was unlikely to build momentum in the brief lame-duck session.\n\nCNN has reached out to Tillis’ and Sinema’s offices for comment.\n\nDespite a legal process that remains up in the air, officials are deep into preparation as they stare down ominous signs of what may come next.\n\nAlready, over the weekend, more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the United States each day in only one section of the border, according to a senior Border Patrol official, marking what he described as a “major surge in illegal crossings” in the El Paso, Texas, sector.\n\nHomeland Security officials have described the mood within the administration as concerned and worried about an influx in the near term.\n\nBorder planning underway\n\nIn the face of losing Title 42 and amid concerns of a surge, officials have weighed what immigrant advocates have described as a draconian approach by creating hurdles for migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The asylum proposal was included in a memo sent from the Department of Homeland Security to the White House, one source told CNN.\n\nWhite House officials have also been in daily conversations with DHS officials about planning, sources told CNN. The National Security Council, which has been heavily involved in migration management amid mass movement across the Western hemisphere, has also played a critical role, sources said.\n\n“The team has been working really hard to ensure we’re taking steps to manage the expiration of Title 42 and put in place a process that’s orderly and humane. And we believe in doing so, we can protect our security concerns,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday.\n\nIf adopted, the asylum proposal would be reminiscent of a policy put in place during the Trump administration that dramatically limited the ability of migrants to claim asylum in the US if they resided or traveled through other countries prior to coming to the US. No decision has been made on the proposal.\n\nAdministration officials have also set other plans in motion in anticipation of a surge of migrants when Trump-era Covid restrictions are lifted this month following a court order blocking the use of Title 42. The legal fight intensified this week when 19 Republican-led states asked a federal appeals court to rule on their request to suspend the termination of the policy by Friday, according to a court filing.\n\nSince March 2020, when the authority was invoked, border officials have turned away migrants at the US-Mexico border more than two million times.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is preparing temporary facilities to process migrants, including in El Paso, as well as discussing ways to return non-Mexican migrants to Mexico through existing legal mechanisms aside from Title 42, according to two Homeland Security officials who stressed there’s been hourslong meetings daily to plan for an influx of migrants.\n\nIn a document outlining border security preparedness and obtained by CNN, DHS broke down its six-pillar plan, which was released in the spring and has since been updated. It includes scaling up ground and air transportation capabilities to transport migrants for processing and remove them, leaning on a CBP One mobile application to process asylum seekers, and increasing referrals for prosecutions for repeat border crossers, the document said.\n\nIn it, DHS also stressed the need for congressional action to update outdated statutes and help create a functioning asylum system, as the current one is under immense strain.\n\nBut just days away from the anticipated end of Title 42, plans are still being sorted out.\n\n“The 21st (is) going to be a disaster. There are so many things in the pipeline, but nothing is ready (to) go,” one official said, referring to December 21 when Title 42 is set to end.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas underscored the whole of government approach in a statement, noting that mass movement of people around the globe has posed a uniquely difficult challenge.\n\n“Despite our efforts, our outdated immigration system is under strain; that is true at the federal level, as well as for state, local, NGO, and community partners. In the absence of congressional action to reform the immigration and asylum systems, a significant increase in migrant encounters will strain our system even further,” he said.\n\n“Addressing this challenge will take time and additional resources, and we need the partnership of Congress, state and local officials, NGOs, and communities to do so,” he added.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, however, has called Title 42 critical and criticized what he called a “whack a mole” approach to the issue.\n\n“If there’s a surge in the valley, they’ll move people down there. If there is more people crossing let’s say, Del Rio, Eagle Pass they’ll move agents over there. Now they’re moving agents to El Paso. This is not the way to secure the border,” Cuellar said Wednesday on “CNN This Morning,” adding a call for Biden to visit the border and see the situation for himself.\n\n“I don’t know why they keep avoiding the border and saying there’s other things more important than visiting the border,” he said. “If there’s a crisis, show up. Just show up.”\n\nMajor surge in arrivals expected\n\nOfficials have already been contending with thousands of migrants crossing the border daily and expect those numbers to increase in the coming days and weeks, overwhelming already-strained resources.\n\nCNN previously reported that DHS is preparing for multiple scenarios, including projections of between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants a day, more than double the current number of people crossing.\n\nOver the weekend, US border authorities apprehended more than 16,000 people, US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said on Twitter. Among the cities seeing an influx in migrants is El Paso, which has previously grappled with a surge of migrants.\n\nEl Paso city officials said Tuesday they’re monitoring the situation and are in ongoing discussions with federal, state, and local partners. Mayorkas also visited El Paso on Tuesday where he met with the Customs and Border Protection workforce and local officials.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking Congress for more than $3 billion as it prepares for the end of Title 42, according to a source familiar with the ask.\n\nThe request is intended to shore up resources for border management and technology and is part of broader funding discussions. It is not specific to the end of Title 42, the source said.\n\n“If Republicans in Congress are serious about border security, they would ensure that the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security have the resources they need to secure our border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement.\n\nOther border cities are also bracing for an influx of arrivals, including Laredo, Texas.\n\nCuellar, who represents Texas’ 28th District, told CNN he’s in close touch with the city of Laredo about preparations, adding that the city may bus migrants to other locations as they’ve done in the past if nonprofits can’t handle the influx of arrivals.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Phil Mattingly", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/politics/title-42-joe-biden-white-house-migration-concerns/index.html", "title": "White House officials growing anxious over anticipated surge of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhite House officials are increasingly anxious about an expected migrant surge at the end of May coinciding with the repeal of a restrictive Trump-era border policy that has let them turn people away.\n\nThe political fallout over the Biden administration’s decision to terminate a Trump-era pandemic restriction, known as Title 42, on the US-Mexico border has put into sharp focus the precarious position for the White House – between its goals to welcome immigrants and weighing using drastic Trump-era policies to try to stem the flow of migrants arriving at the border.\n\n“People are worried about where this is going and weathering the storm,” a source familiar with discussions told CNN.\n\nOne source who is in regular contact with senior-most administration officials about immigration policy said concern at the White House about the situation at the border has only grown as the midterm elections approach – and all the more so in recent days after the announcement that Title 42 will officially end in May.\n\n“It was always going to be hard,” the person said, “and now they’re closer to the midterms.”\n\nAnother source close to the White House described a “high level of apprehension” in recent weeks.\n\n“They watch the border numbers every day,” the person said. “They’re very aware of what the situation is at the border.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain and President Joe Biden’s domestic policy adviser Susan Rice – two powerful political voices in the administration – are among the top administration officials who have been intimately involved in discussing the situation.\n\nA political minefield\n\nIssues related to the US-Mexico border and the entry of migrants into the country have long been politically fraught for both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nBiden, who campaigned against Trump-era immigration policies, has received heated criticism from Republicans for his handling of border enforcement. But he’s also faced pushback from inside his own party for continuing to implement some of his predecessor’s policies that are unpopular with progressives.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki highlighted the administration’s plans in a Thursday press briefing, saying: “I would note the Department of Homeland Security also put together a preparedness plan to continue addressing irregular migration that involves surging personnel and resources to the border, improving border processing, implementing mitigation measures and working with other countries in the hemisphere to manage migration.”\n\nIn the span of a year, Biden has already grappled with a record number of unaccompanied migrant children at the US southern border and thousands of primarily Haitian migrants who camped in deplorable conditions under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas. Those incidents – which were used as fodder for Republicans looking to criticize the administration – are still fresh on the minds of officials bracing for busy weeks ahead.\n\n“We can’t have another Del Rio happen to us,” US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said last month.\n\nAvoiding that, though, might include the continued use of policies the administration has repeatedly criticized, like the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy that requires non-Mexican migrants to stay in Mexico until their US immigration court date. The policy, which restarted late last year after a court ruling, marked an unprecedented departure from previous protocols. Even so, the end of one Trump-era policy may give away to another growing in numbers.\n\n“We will employ much greater numbers post-Title 42,” a Homeland Security official recently told reporters, referring to the “remain in Mexico” policy, which is formally called Migrant Protection Protocols.\n\n“We are under a court order to reimplement MPP in good faith and as part of those good faith efforts, we have been systematically increasing our enrollment under MPP,” the official added.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has twice issued a memo trying to terminate the “remain in Mexico” policy, outlining its shortcomings and arguing it puts migrants in harm’s way, but the court ruling forced the administration to restart the policy. The administration is appealing the ruling.\n\nAs of April 3, nearly 2,000 people have been sent back to Mexico under the policy, according to the International Organization for Migration. That number is expected to grow, though given long-processing times and numerous other safeguards the administration has tried to implement, it’s unlikely to expand enough to stem the flow of migrants\n\nTens of thousands of migrants could surge to the border once restrictions lift\n\nStill, Republicans and some Democrats have expressed concern over the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to revoke Title 42 next month, arguing that it’s a reckless decision amid pent-up demand to come to the US among migrants who are facing deteriorating conditions at home.\n\nIntelligence assessments have found that people are in a “wait and see” mode and trying to determine when they have the best likelihood of entry into the US, according to a federal law enforcement official, adding that some of the 30,000 to 60,000 people could seek entry within hours if the CDC rule is repealed.\n\nThe White House has held interagency meetings about the intelligence and the situation more broadly, the official said.\n\nBy pulling back Title 42, the administration is returning to the usual operating procedures that have been in place for decades for processing migrants. That includes releasing migrants who claim asylum into the US, sometimes under an alternative form of detention, or detaining migrants and deporting them back to their home country.\n\nBut given conditions in Latin America, which was hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, more migrants may want to journey to the US southern border.\n\n“As a result of the CDC’s termination of its Title 42 public health order, we will likely face an increase in encounters above the current high levels. There are a significant number of individuals who were unable to access the asylum system for the past two years, and who may decide that now is the time to come,” US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security released detailed plans for varying scenarios that could unfold at the US-Mexico border in the coming weeks.\n\nThree planning scenarios have been devised to trigger what resources might be needed. The first scenario is where current arrest figures are, the second scenario is up to 12,000 people a day and the third scenario is up to 18,000 people a day, according to a planning document.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has set up a “Southwest Border Coordination Center” to coordinate a response to a potential surge among federal agencies. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed FEMA Region 3’s regional administrator, MaryAnn Tierney, in March to head the center.\n\nAs part of the preparation, CBP has deployed 400 agents from other parts of the US border to assist operations on the southern border, increased number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel to assist in processing migrants, called on volunteers in the DHS workforce, and contracted to move thousands of migrants if need be.\n\nCBP is also preparing to add new temporary facilities to alleviate any overcrowding. According to the DHS planning document, CBP holding facilities can hold over 16,000 migrants and expand to 17,000 with additional facilities opening in early April. Existing contracts can also be expanded to meet needs if there are up to 30,000 migrants in custody in a worst-case scenario.\n\nBut despite those plans, some Democrats are wary about moving forward with a return to the usual protocols on the border.

Some families have been waiting there for weeks.\n\nMigrants who spoke to CNN by phone and in person describe the conditions in the camp as dire. They are sleeping under tents and don’t know where their next meal will come from. Temperatures are expected to dip below freezing in the next few days.\n\nMany, including mothers and sick children, are living on the streets, in abandoned homes and on sidewalks as they wait. “They feel desperate,” said Glady Edith Cañas, director of the non-profit Ayudándoles a Triunfar.\n\nAt the heart of their limbo: Some migrants have been waiting for the end of the public health border policy known as Title 42. The 2020 policy, which officials said was an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19, allows authorities to swiftly expel migrants encountered at the southern border, with some exceptions.\n\nThe Title 42 policy was set to end Wednesday, but Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday put a temporary hold on its termination. Until the court issues an order – which can come at any time – the authority will remain in place; the Biden administration is asking the court to let the policy end next week.\n\nOfficials have predicted lifting Title 42 will result in a spike in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US, and border cities have been bracing for a flood of people.\n\nNow, because the end of Title 42 is delayed, uncertainty looms over those waiting at the border.\n\nSome migrants are not waiting\n\nCNN drone pilot Al Meshberg captured video of a large group of migrants gathered on the Mexican banks of the Rio Grande and a large law enforcement presence of US Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety and Texas National Guard on the US side.\n\nAs CNN cameras rolled, a group of migrants, including small children, crossed the river on a raft. Moments after the migrants crossed into the United States, the migrants could be seen walking out of the bushes wrapped in synthetic blankets while being escorted to Border Patrol vehicles.\n\nThis week at Matamoros, some used inflatable rafts to cross the Rio Grande, pulling themselves over on a rope attached to the US side. In a video of a crossing there obtained by CNN, some are heard saying they were tired of waiting.\n\nMeanwhile, at the westernmost edge of Texas this week, some 800 miles northwest of Matamoros, National Guard troops and state police lined one side of the Rio Grande at El Paso, and armed members of the Mexican army line some parts of the other side at Ciudad Juárez.\n\nThere, after crossing the river – wading through discarded belongings of those who came before them – migrants have in recent days lined up for hours near the border wall to turn themselves in to US Border Patrol agents.\n\nAs the sun set, some lit fires to keep warm or wrapped themselves in blankets and stayed in line.\n\nA group of migrants are waiting on the US side of the Rio Grande as the Texas National Guard blocked access to parts of the border with barbed wire and vehicles as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on December 20, 2022.

Four people were taken into custody after they tried to crawl under the barbed wire, video showed.\n\nMigrants hoping to cross were told Wednesday morning to go to a point about a mile down the river. There, once again, they lined up outside the border wall on the US side to present themselves for asylum requests.\n\nElsewhere on the US side, shelters are packed, and still, not everyone is sheltered.

Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security projected last month that between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border daily when Title 42 ends, more than double the number of people crossing at the time.\n\nCrossings are already rising in some areas.\n\nIn the last two weeks, border authorities in the Rio Grande Valley at Texas’ southern tip encountered between 900 and 1,200 migrants daily, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. That’s reminiscent of a surge in 2019, when agents encountered at least 1,000 daily, the source said.\n\nAnd a senior Border Patrol official said last week more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the US near El Paso daily over the weekend, describing the number as a “major surge in illegal crossings” in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, housing the arriving migrants has presented a challenge.\n\n“I really believe that today our asylum-seekers are not safe as we have hundreds and hundreds on the streets and that’s not the way we want to treat people,” El Paso’s mayor said Saturday.\n\nTwo vacant schools in El Paso will be used as temporary sheltering facilities for migrants, city authorities announced Tuesday, in addition to three emergency shelter hotels.\n\nThe city is also sending teams to the different areas where migrants are gathering to provide transportation services and temporary shelter.\n\n“All eyes are on El Paso and for this reason, we must show the world the compassion our community is known for and illustrate the resilience and strength of our region,” City Manager Tommy Gonzalez said in a statement.\n\nThe American Red Cross has deployed resources and personnel to El Paso to assist with the influx of migrants, the organization said in a Wednesday statement. The organization has provided phones to organizations working in the region so migrants can reconnect with family members.\n\nMigrants sleep in the cold outside a bus station on December 18, 2022 in El Paso, Texas. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nTitle 42 frozen, but plans still underway\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security last week released a plan for the scheduled end of Title 42. It involved surging resources to the border – including hiring nearly 1,000 Border Patrol processing coordinators – and increasing transportation resources, such as flights and buses.\n\nDespite the freeze on ending the policy, US authorities are moving forward with planning.\n\n“We’re going on as if nothing’s changed,” a senior US Customs and Border Protection official told CNN, adding policy discussions are still underway to provide other legal pathways to Nicaraguans, Haitians and Cubans who make up a large number of encounters.\n\nAs for what happens on Wednesday if the expiration is still on hold, one official said there may be a “mini surge.”\n\n“I think there’s some that probably haven’t gotten the message and won’t until they cross,” the official said. “There are some already committed who will cross.”", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/politics/migrant-border-crossings-could-double/index.html", "title": "Biden administration projecting daily migrant border crossings could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is projecting between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border a day when a Trump-era border policy ends in late December, more than double the current number of people crossing, according to a source familiar with the projections.\n\nOfficials are bracing for an influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States when the controversial public health authority, known as Title 42, ends in three weeks.\n\nSince March 2020, border authorities have been able to turn away migrants encountered along the border under Title 42. That will no longer be the case in late December, as authorities return to traditional protocols following a court order earlier this month that struck down the policy.\n\nUnder those protocols, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nOfficials earlier this year said they expected lifting Title 42 would prompt an increase of migrants trying to cross into the United States. The latest projections are in line with outcomes officials prepared for at the time, including a worst-case-scenario possibility that up to 18,000 migrants a day could try to cross the border.\n\nEncounters along the US-Mexico border currently range between 6,000 to 7,000 a day amid mass migration in the Western hemisphere that’s been fueled by deteriorating conditions in the region.\n\nIn 2019, during the height of that year’s border crisis and prior to Title 42, there were up to nearly 6,000 encounters a day, according to a former Homeland Security official.\n\nSources cautioned that projections are fluid, given in part challenges in predicting migration patterns and people who attempt to cross more than once. DHS also uses projections to prepare resources for multiple scenarios.\n\n“As was the case before Title 42 went into effect and will remain the case after it, individuals encountered at the border and without a legal basis to remain in the United States will be subject to prompt removal,” an administration official told CNN.\n\nTitle 42 was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and has been fiercely criticized by immigrant advocates and public health experts who argue the authority has been used as a pretext to largely bar migrants from entering the country.\n\nBorder authorities used the public health restrictions to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years. But earlier this month, a federal judge struck down the restrictions. US District Judge Emmet Sullivan put his ruling on hold until midnight December 21.\n\nDHS officials are pulling from border plans released over the spring to prepare for the end of Title 42, including, for example, considering additional soft-sided facilities to process migrants.\n\nThe department is also accelerating asylum processing times, doubling down on anti-smuggling operations, and coordinating with partners in the Western hemisphere, according to the administration official.\n\n“As we prepare to transition to the next phase of our work to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to double down on these proven strategies,” the administration official said.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/politics/biden-immigration-crisis-title-42/index.html", "title": "Everyone can now agree -- the US has a border crisis | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA pointless argument battered Washington for much of this year over whether the southern US border is in crisis. But no one is now doubting the chaos and potential migrant surge that could be triggered by an imminent policy shift next week.\n\nThe expiry on Wednesday of a Trump-era order that exploited public health justifications during the pandemic to turn away thousands of migrants is expected to severely strain an already stretched border, immigration and asylum system.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security unveiled Thursday an emergency six-point plan to tackle the crisis as Republicans preparing to take over the House brandished the potential chaos as proof of their claims of gross White House negligence over the border.\n\nEven some Democrats are warning that an huge influx of immigrants next week could cause multiple adverse consequences. Critics say the administration took too long to engage on the issue and hasn’t done enough, though they also fault Congress for failing for decades to reform the immigration system and border enforcement – a goal that polls repeatedly show the public supports.\n\n“We have a leak,” Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez said on “CNN This Morning” Thursday. “We need a plumber to come and stop the leak. And instead, what we’re doing is we’re sending us more buckets to hold the water.”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom meanwhile told ABC News this week that the expiry of the policy known as Title 42 could overburden his state’s capacity to cope. “The fact is, what we’ve got right now is not working, and it’s about to break in a post-(Title) 42 world unless we take some responsibility and ownership,” he said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CBS News she was worried about an increase in “illegal migration” and drug smuggling. Some Democratic jurisdictions, like New York City for instance are already struggling to cope with immigrants who have already arrived as they brace for more.\n\nA pandemic-era band aid on a broader problem\n\nTitle 42 was introduced early in the Covid-19 emergency and allowed officials to turn away certain categories of migrants. But critics say it not only abused the principles of public health, especially by being in force so long, but that it was a cruel and unfair infringement of the human right to make an asylum claim. A federal judge in Louisiana blocked a previous bid by the Biden administration to cancel the order, but a federal judge in Washington struck it down in November, declaring it “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nAmid growing concerns that large groups of migrants waiting in Mexico could cross over the border next week, Biden’s team said Thursday it was surging resources to the area, improving processing efficiency for immigration claims, imposing consequences for unlawful entry, bolstering nonprofit capacity, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\nBut it has often seemed like the White House wanted to talk about anything but the border to avoid political blowback and that the administration lacked urgency in tackling immigration as a whole – one of the most nettlesome issues for this president and his predecessors. Republicans have demanded Biden visit the border, though the political theatrics surrounding such a trip might now cloud any attempt by the president to offer clarity on a deeply complicated problem. Still, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas said on CNN “This Morning” Wednesday that the president should go anyway.\n\n“I don’t know why they keep avoiding the border and saying there’s other things more important than visiting the border,” he said. “If there’s a crisis, show up. Just show up,” Cuellar said.\n\nAnd in another setback to Biden’s efforts to end some of Trump’s controversial immigration policies, a federal judge in Texas has paused the administration’s most recent attempt to end the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program, which sends certain non-Mexican citizens who entered the US back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out.\n\nGOP prepares relentless scrutiny on border\n\nIt is well within the new GOP majority’s right to investigate the administration’s failure to stem a rise in encounters with border crossers in Biden’s term and the intensity of its immigration policy as a whole. US border authorities encountered more than two million migrants in fiscal 2022, according to US Customs and Border Protection figures released in October – up from 1.7 million in 2021. Conservatives say this is proof of an “open border” that means many more migrants get through in a scenario that endangers national security. Many Democrats argue that large numbers of migrants encounter border agents in multiple attempts to cross into the US after they are repeatedly sent back.\n\nBut more broadly, the expiry of Title 42 is also a microcosm of a toxic debate over immigration, demagogued by conservative media and distorted by some Republicans for a political jolt that has made a multi-layered international and domestic issue impossible to solve for decades. Former President Donald Trump’s extreme rhetoric and chaotic hardline approach further poisoned the well over this issue and left the immigration system in chaos.\n\nSome members in the new GOP House majority that will take over next month seem more determined to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for a so-far unspecified high crime and misdemeanor, in revenge for Trump’s double impeachment, than in working to find a comprehensive solution to one of the nation’s worst problems.\n\nAnd by shipping migrants to places like Manhattan, Washington and Martha’s Vineyard, Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott of Texas meanwhile seem keener to score points with potential Republican presidential primary voters by using migrants as political pawns than to draw attention to the burden borne by states in this crisis.\n\nRepublicans are right to highlight the epidemic of deaths from fentanyl in the United States that is coming across the border from Mexico often using precursor chemicals from China. But they also spent four years indulging Trump’s obsession with a border wall that does little to stem the influx of the narcotics that mostly comes through border checkpoints, concealed in vehicles by drugs cartels.\n\nAnother tragedy highlighted over Title 42’s expiration is rooted in the plight of migrants fleeing crime, persecution, economic and social repression in central and South America who make a perilous journey to the United States, often at the mercy of ruthless human traffickers and with no certain outcome.\n\nBiden assigned Vice President Kamala Harris to address the root causes of immigration from nations in the Western Hemisphere. Her task is a fraught one, considering the corruption, unstable states and tensions between nations like Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela and El Salvador and the United States – not to mention troubled relations in recent years between Mexico and Washington.\n\nShe argued at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles in June that no migrant wanted to leave home but that many were forced out by dire conditions. Harris has also sought to drum up private investment to mitigate the poverty that forces people to flee. But at the same time, there hasn’t been much public evidence recently that her efforts are bearing fruit or a sense that an issue that brings substantial political peril is her overwhelming priority.\n\nAny permanent solution to border issues would involve a massive investment to secure the frontier, with barriers where it makes sense but also with new tracking technology and manpower where walls don’t help. It would address the plight of undocumented migrants brought to the US as children who are known as Dreamers. It would also provide a long-term path to legal status for millions more undocumented migrants, expand asylum courts to expedite claims and reform the system of legal immigration and visas for migrant workers needed to address economically damaging labor shortages in agriculture and catering industries, for instance.\n\nBut the political tradeoffs and goodwill required for such a reform defied Congress during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. A last-ditch effort by Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and newly independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema that would have led to the protections of Dreamers and new measures to halt border crossings in this Congress just fizzled.\n\nIt was the latest sign that a broken Washington can’t fix one of America’s most intractable problems – a failure that repeatedly leads to situations like the one that will unfold at the border next week.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/politics/border-title-42-whats-next-cec/index.html", "title": "We're expecting a big increase in migrants at the US-Mexico border ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore migrants are coming to the US-Mexico border, and officials say they expect the number to grow.\n\nThis is something we’ve seen many times before.

The policy is known as Title 42 for the US code invoked in its implementation, and its days are numbered.\n\nUnder that policy, authorities turned away migrants more than 1.7 million times, expelling them into Mexico or back to their home countries, according to Customs and Border Protection statistics.\n\nNow there’s a big bottleneck of people waiting to cross. And the rule that stood in their way is soon set to be lifted.\n\nA migrant from Haiti stands near a border crossing bridge in Tijuana, Mexico, on March 22. Cesar Rodriguez/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration announced Friday that it’s planning to end that public health policy on May 23.\n\nWhy wait until May? Officials appear to be giving themselves a cushion to plan for the possibility that the number of migrants at the border will significantly increase.\n\nAnd for days now, they’ve been telling us it will.\n\nThe US Border Patrol chief told CNN about it last week, describing a record-breaking surge and estimating agents would be arresting about 8,000 people daily. And the White House also says officials are preparing for things to intensify.\n\n“We have every expectation that when the CDC ultimately decides it’s appropriate to lift Title 42, there will be an influx of people to the border,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said on Wednesday. “And so we are doing a lot of work to plan for that contingency.”\n\nAlready the number of people arrested at the border is going up\n\nThe number of arrests at the US-Mexico border has already been on the rise. The Border Patrol made more than 158,000 arrests there in February, up from January when there were nearly 148,000 apprehensions.\n\nA US Customs and Border Protection officer directs migrants seeking asylum into vans before transferring them to temporary shelters in Yuma, Arizona, in February. Nicolo Filippo Rosso/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThat increase isn’t surprising. To some extent, migration is seasonal. And the number of people trying to cross the border tends to go up in the spring. Experts say the economic hardships of the pandemic have further intensified migration trends.\n\nIn the border city of Del Rio, Texas, Tiffany Burrow told CNN’s Rosa Flores this week that she’s been seeing the increase at the respite center she directs. More than 4,400 migrants have been dropped off there after being released from US Customs and Border Protection custody over the past month, she says – more than twice the number in January. Asked whether she was ready for what could happen if Title 42 is lifted, Burrow said, “I don’t think anyone can truly be prepared.”\n\nVal Verde County Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez told Flores he thinks back to last year, when thousands of migrants camped under a bridge in Del Rio, waiting for immigration authorities to process them.\n\n“Last year we called it a crisis. This year, (if) we see the same thing here in Del Rio, you know, it’s going to be a disaster,” Martinez said.\n\nAt the national level, politicians and advocacy groups also appear to be bracing themselves for something big to happen.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates who work along the border and leading Democratic lawmakers have been pushing the administration to end Title 42, arguing the public health restriction was merely a pretext for the US to stop vulnerable people from seeking asylum. Many have praised reports that the policy will be ending soon, while also criticizing the delay.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican lawmakers have been lambasting the Biden administration for even considering lifting Title 42. And Stephen Miller, a senior adviser in the Trump administration, warned on Twitter that revoking the policy would be “one of history’s most spectacular travesties” and “open the floodgates on a biblical scale.”\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers march in Tijuana to protest the Title 42 policy on March 21.

Some of them could seek entry within hours if the CDC rule is repealed, the official said.\n\nThree planning scenarios have been devised to trigger what resources might be needed. A planning document outlines three possibilities officials are preparing for as they assess what resources could be needed, with a worst-case scenario of up to 18,000 people trying to cross the border daily.\n\nAnd officials issued a fact sheet outlining the many steps they said DHS had taken to prepare, including establishing a border coordination center, making plans to send more resources to the region and taking steps to adjudicate asylum claims more efficiently.\n\nIt’s possible both to end Title 42 and process asylum seekers in an orderly fashion, says Erika Pinheiro, litigation and policy director of Al Otro Lado, an organization that provides aid to migrants and refugees.\n\nBut Pinheiro told CNN last week she was concerned administration officials haven’t done more to include advocates in their plans. Still, she says she’s found hope in the Ukrainian families who have recently been allowed to cross the border.\n\n“I feel angry on behalf of my clients who’ve been waiting for two years, but it also gives me a lot of hope that we can end Title 42 in a dignified and orderly way,” she says.\n\nDespite the many predictions from officials, politicians and pundits, it’s important to remember there’s a lot we still don’t know about what will happen next.\n\nWill officials be prepared as numbers increase? Or will we yet again see overcrowded facilities, an overwhelmed system and political debate over the border escalating to a fever pitch?\n\nThere are a lot of things that are different about the current moment at the border. But we could still see history repeat itself.\n\nWe’ll be watching what steps the administration takes in the coming months — and what happens at the border — closely.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

He added that the opening largely depends on when the county's Welcome Center and local nongovernmental organization shelters reach capacity.\n\nAdditionally, Rodriguez reported that the city has requested $25 million in support from the federal government and has so far received half of that, which will be added to the $14 million the city has on hand to deal with the expected surge in arrivals.\n\nDEADLY TEXAS CRASH:Driver in crash that killed 8 near Texas migrant center charged with manslaughter\n\nEl Paso sees overcrowding of migrants amid surge of asylum-seekers\n\nAs many as 15,000 asylum-seekers are waiting in Juárez, Mexico, to enter the United States.

The policy allows allows border agents to swiftly return migrants to Mexico.\n\nThe termination of the policy is expected to lead to an increase in border crossings since authorities will no longer be able to quickly expel them as has been done since March 2020.\n\nAuthorities drop off hundreds of migrants at respite centers\n\nFederal agencies in the Rio Grande Valley are also receiving at least 200 additional migrants who are arriving by plane or by bus from other border patrol sectors, like Del Rio and Laredo, according to the same law enforcement source.\n\nThe federal government’s process of moving migrants out of areas that are at capacity and to areas with room for processing is called “decompression.”\n\nTwo prominent non-profits in South Texas say border authorities are currently dropping off between 600 and 750 migrants at the respite centers they run in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nVenezuelan migrants stand near the Rio Bravo river, the border between Mexico and the US, as they wait for the announcement about the end of Title 42 on December 21, in Ciudad Juarez.

Workers with the Marine Resources Division are tending to thousands of larval flounder at a state hatchery in Gulf Shores, according to a news release from the agency. They hope to get between 1,000 and 5,000 fish from the hatchery in the first year, with a goal of releasing about 60,000 fish annually in a few years. Those fish would help add to a population of southern flounder that’s been falling since 2008. Scientists aren’t sure what is causing the decline. The state decreased bag limits for the fish this year and closed the season for the whole month of November to protect the flounder that were migrating through coastal bays on their way to winter spawning grounds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The oldest son of President Donald Trump has received a permit to hunt and kill a grizzly bear in the state, officials said Monday. Donald Trump Jr. was granted the permit to hunt north and east of Nome later this year, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. The governor has a limited number of “dignitary” licenses and game tags that he can hand out, Fish and Game spokesman Rick Green said. Trump Jr. did not receive one. He instead applied for one of 27 licenses designated for out-of-state hunters in the area. Only two other hunters applied. Officials said permits near Nome likely are not in demand for a variety of reasons, including the remoteness of the area and the expense to get there. As an out-of-state resident, Trump Jr. must be accompanied by a licensed Alaska guide for his hunt.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Republicans in the state Senate have given initial approval to a measure that would ask voters to limit the population differences among Arizona’s 30 legislative districts, over opposition from Democrats. The measure by Sen. J.D. Mesnard would require the state’s redistricting commission to create districts with a maximum difference of 5,000 people. Currently, a 10% difference is considered constitutional, meaning districts can vary by about 20,000 people. Democrats argued the change would greatly affect the ability of tribes and minority communities to elect representatives of their choice. They also said putting in hard rules like Mesnard proposes minimizes other factors the state’s Independent Redistricting Commission is required to consider, including keeping communities of interest together if possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nEureka Springs: A cemetery will continue allowing individuals or groups to place Confederate flags on grave markers unless a family member of the deceased objects, despite complaints the flag is a racist symbol. Eureka Springs’ cemetery commission approved an amendment earlier this month also requiring anyone wanting to place flags or plaques to get permission from the cemetery superintendent, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Glenna Booth, a member of the commission, said the amendment was her idea. “I just tried to come up with something that would be fair to everyone,” Booth said. Gloria Stevens, sexton at the cemetery, said there are about 47 Confederate veterans and 97 Union veterans among the 4,600 burials there. She said the cemetery was established in 1889, so none of those veterans died during the Civil War.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In their latest bid to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis, lawmakers on Monday announced a package of bills to limit development fees that can add tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a new home. However, local governments depend heavily on the fees, which typically are used to pay for schools, roads and parks. Lawmakers said they were discussing those needs but have not yet decided how the fees might be replaced. The fees are “vital to local government’s ability to pay for the infrastructure that residents living in new developments need,” Chris Lee, legislative representative for the California State Association of Counties, said in a statement. Development-related fees, also known as impact fees, can provide up to a third of some cities’ budgets, according to a report last year by the University of California, Berkeley, Terner Center for Housing Innovation.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Thousands of 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential primary for the first time under a new state law. The law allows 17-year-olds to cast ballots in spring primaries if they turn 18 before November’s general election. At least seven states and Washington, D.C., have similar laws. According to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office, about 24,000 teens are eligible to vote in the March 3 primary under the change, a small number in a state with 3.4 million voters, the Sentinel Colorado reports. Three Overland High School students who were interviewed about the new law said they did not know about their ability to vote until a few weeks ago and figure most of their peers were not aware either.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state legislative committee voted Monday to advance a bill that would eliminate the state’s religious exemption for certain childhood vaccines, despite vocal opposition from hundreds of parents and children who packed the Connecticut Capitol complex in hopes of persuading lawmakers to defeat it. The legislation narrowly cleared the General Assembly’s Public Health Committee by a vote of 14-11, prompting chants of “we will remember in November” after the tally was announced. Some opponents of the bill booed and shouted at the legislators who had voted for the measure as they left the hearing room and tried to get into elevators to their offices. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the bill, which now awaits further action in the House of Representatives. It’s considered one of the most contentious issues of the three-month legislative session, fueling concerns about the safety of vaccines and the curtailment of parental and religious rights.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has rejected a challenge by state environmental officials to rules issued by utility regulators regarding renewable energy requirements. The judge on Monday ruled that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has no standing to challenge regulations issued by the Public Service Commission. Superior Court Judge Ferris Wharton agreed with the commission and the state Division of the Public Advocate that DNREC had no standing to sue because it was neither a “person” nor “aggrieved” under Delaware’s Administrative Procedures Act. Environmental secretary Shawn Garvin did not respond to an email seeking comment, but a spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision and will discuss its options. The ruling is the latest development in a long-running legal dispute over which state agency has authority to develop regulations regarding how minimum renewable energy purchase requirements can be frozen if they become too costly for ratepayers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man who was injured while assembling a construction crane was safely rescued from a high angle in D.C. The man, who wasn’t identified, suffered a serious injury to his leg Saturday while working on the crane about 230 feet off the ground, news outlets report. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services used a second crane to reach the man and provide initial treatment. He was then placed in a basket and lowered to the ground, according to videos shared by the department. The worker was taken to the hospital for an injury not considered life-threatening.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Promising to be a worldwide first, a new Southwest Florida marina could set the standard for future boat storage. Set to open in April on Fort Myers Beach, Gulf Star Marina is being branded as the “world’s first SMART Marina” due to using its ASAR, or automated, storage and retrieval system. “The entire world is watching,” said Todd Carroll, one of the marina’s owners and president of Carroll Properties. “We believe it has the ability to change the way we store boats. It’s just a much better way.” The technology was developed by Austria-based LTW Intralogistics, which has been creating automated systems for warehouses used by companies like IKEA for decades, Carroll said. But it’s never been done in a marina before, according to Carroll. The railed system ditches the diesel-powered forklift often used in dry storage facilities and replaces it with an automated, electric-powered storage crane and shuttles.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State senators have approved a measure that would increase the fee for dumping coal ash in Georgia. The Senate passed Senate Bill 123 on Monday by a vote of 52-2, sending it to the House for more work. The measure would raise the fee for dumping coal ash from $1 a ton to $2.50 a ton, equaling what it costs to dispose of other kinds of garbage at Georgia landfills. Lawmakers raised the fee for other garbage in 2018 but left the fee for coal ash at $1. Coal ash has become a flashpoint in the current General Assembly session and in the state at large. A 2018 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice found contaminated groundwater near 11 of 12 coal-fired power plants. The refuse contains heavy metals and other contaminates that can leach into groundwater. Near Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer in Juliette, environmentalists have been conducting tests that have found residents have contaminated well water.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A research report has predicted the state may be hit by the economic fallout of a new virus, negatively affecting the tourism industry. The University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization said the spread of COVID-19 could undermine previous predictions that 2020 would be a better year for tourism than 2019. The organization’s latest quarterly forecast on the state’s visitor industry released Monday said the virus that started in China has changed its previous calculation. “I think if it hadn’t been for this virus outbreak, it probably would have been better – mostly because the global economy was sort of repairing itself,” said Carl Bonham, the organization’s executive director. “Trade tensions had eased up a little bit. We were expecting some recovery in 2020, and now that hope has sort of been dashed.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Visitors to the state who are 18 and older and can legally possess firearms would be allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits under legislation that headed to the House on Monday. The House State Affairs Committee voted 11-3 to approve the bill brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. Republicans on the committee backed the measure, while all the Democrats voted against it. Idaho residents 18 and older are allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits in Idaho without a permit or training following a new law that went into place last summer. The legislation would extend that to any legal resident of the United States or a U.S. armed services member. Zito said the legislation is intended to clear up confusion. Opponents say allowing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon without any required training within city limits is a bad idea and could lead to shootings.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The sale of recreational marijuana in the state generated $7.3 million in cannabis tax revenue last month, the Department of Revenue announced Monday. The department also reported that an additional $3.1 million was generated in retail sales tax revenue. Dispensaries across the state sold nearly $40 million in recreational pot last month. Toi Hutchinson, an adviser to Gov. J.B. Pritzker on cannabis control, said the goal of Illinois’ legal cannabis industry is to build a socially equitable program to help communities most harmed by the nation’s war on drugs. “Revenue raised in this first month will soon begin flowing back into those communities to begin repairing the damage done by the failed policies of the past and creating new opportunities for those who have been left behind for far too long,” Hutchinson said.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at Grissom Air Reserve Base is seeking a $100,000 boost from local government toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders are asking for Miami County economic development fund money as they plan the estimated $700,000 exhibit space featuring the bomber, dozens of which were stationed at the Indiana base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber, and only seven remain out of the 116 built, the Kokomo Tribune reports. The museum has raised more than $100,000 toward the project and hopes to build a roof over the Hustler this year while continuing to raise money, museum Director Tom Jennings said. The project plans call for a display of artifacts about the bomber’s history and a loft area allowing visitors to look down on the plane. The Miami County Council could vote on the funding request next month.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is considering asking businesses seeking city tax incentives to also provide housing options if they employ low-income workers. It’s just one proposal for how the city could use its policies, zoning ordinances and financial incentives to ensure its mix of housing includes options that are affordable for its workforce. A workforce housing study released in May found central Iowa is short 57,179 new housing units for the region’s anticipated job growth in the next 20 years. Nearly half of those new workers would need housing priced below $175,000 for an owner-occupied home or below $1,250 a month for a rental. The Des Moines Area Association of Realtors reported in December that the median home price in its listings was $229,000, while CBRE/Hubbell Commercial, a brokerage that tracks the industry, said median rent across the metro is $935 a month. Downtown, it is $1,189 per month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators aren’t ready to declare that marijuana possession never should be a felony, rejecting proposals Monday to lower penalties for third-time offenders and to release others from prison. The House Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee voted 7-4 against a bill that would make possessing marijuana a misdemeanor, no matter how many times someone was convicted. Kansas law currently says a third conviction is a felony that can be punished by up to 14 months in prison, though offenders often receive probation. The bill also initially said offenders now in prison for marijuana possession would be released, but the committee removed that provision from the measure. Supporters of lessening the penalties for repeated marijuana possession accepted the change to give the bill a better chance of passing. Yet the measure failed to clear the GOP-controlled committee anyway.\n\nKentucky\n\nCold Spring: A Northern Kentucky city has become the third municipality in 2020 to adopt a Fairness Ordinance. The leaders of Cold Spring, near Cincinnati, voted 4-1 on Monday night in favor of protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and other accommodations. Cold Spring is the fifth city in Northern Kentucky over the past year to pass such an ordinance, according to the Fairness Campaign. It’s the 19th such community in the commonwealth. Councilman Adam Sandfoss, who introduced the ordinance, said in a statement that “I’m proud of our city’s vote for equal rights tonight. We want folks to know Cold Spring is a community everyone can call home, and I hope our action will inspire more Northern Kentucky communities – maybe even Campbell County – to adopt similar protections for all their residents.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new group focused on Mardi Gras-season parade safety will begin work late this week or early next week, the police chief said Monday in discussing the city’s response to the recent deaths of two people in float-related accidents. Suggestions from family members of the victims and others – such as setting up barricades along the entire length of the parade routes, rather than only at major intersections, and mounting accordion barriers between sections of tandem floats – will be discussed, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told a news conference. Ferguson noted that setting up barricades along parade routes that are 5 to 7 miles long would be time-consuming and require many workers. He also said additional workers would be need to be on hand to move such barricades out of the way for any emergency vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker is hoping to pass a bill he said would protect children in the state from unauthorized surveillance by drones. The proposal from Rep. John Andrews of Paris would create a new state law the legislator said in a statement would “prevent unauthorized drone spying on a person in their domicile where they have an expectation of privacy.” Andrews is asking the state’s Legislative Council to allow his proposal to go through despite the fact a legislation deadline has passed. He said the law would establish penalties for people convicted of surveilling underage children. The Legislative Council is expected to discuss whether to consider the proposal this session on Thursday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Workers would be able to take 12 weeks off work to care for a new child or an ill family member through a new state-administered insurance pool that would provide partial wage replacement, under legislation that received a hearing in a House committee Monday. The measure would create a fund supported by weekly employer and employee contributions. Each would contribute half, based on a sliding scale. An employee with the state’s average wage would contribute $3.62 a week, said Del. Kris Valderrama, a Democrat sponsoring the bill. “It is limited in its scope, but it will allow people a brief respite and help to make ends meet, at least temporarily,” Valderrama said. But opponents said it would create the potential for up to 24 weeks off in some circumstances. Opponents said while they were not fully opposed to the concept, the Maryland measure was too burdensome.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A local museum has received a gift of more than 1,600 photographic works it says will enhance what is already one of the leading collections of Asian photography in the U.S. and Europe. The gift to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem comes from the Joy of Giving Something Foundation, known for its work that explores the intersection of photography and social issues. The collection features the works of 123 artists, primarily of Chinese and Japanese descent or who worked in eastern Asia, from 1930 to the present day. The museum already has a roughly 5,000-piece collection of 19th-century photography. “These photographs deepen our museum’s 220-year relationship with East Asian culture and offer a compelling complement to our historic collection of Asian photography,” Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, the museum’s deputy director, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that the state will have a mobility officer to coordinate all initiatives related to self-driving and connected cars, an effort she said will ensure Michigan is the go-to place for testing and producing vehicles of the future. While speaking at the MICHAuto Summit in Detroit, Whitmer signed an executive directive to create the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, effectively immediately. It will be led by a chief mobility officer whose name probably will be announced in April, Whitmer said. She also signed an executive order to establish the Michigan Council on Future Mobility and Electrification, an advisory group that will replace but function similarly to one created by a 2016 law. The council will be housed within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity instead of the Department of Transportation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Law enforcement officers should get better training in de-escalation skills and in dealing with people experiencing mental health crises, a working group on reducing police-involved deadly force encounters recommended Monday. Minnesota’s two highest-ranking black law enforcement officials – Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington – formed the working group last summer in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police officers, including those of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. Minnesota has had more than 100 officer-involved shootings over the past five years, Harrington said, adding that many members were surprised to learn 60% happened outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, affecting nearly every county in the state. Ellison said the group also learned that between 30% and 50% of the people killed in encounters with police were having mental health crises.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A routine road closure for a transportation worker turned into the quick delivery of a baby on the interstate. Wayne Evans, a superintendent with the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was getting ready to shut down a lane Monday morning on I-20 near Brandon when a car pulled up with its emergency lights flashing, and two women got out of the vehicle. “They were in desperate need for something,” Evans said in an interview shared online by MDOT. When Evans approached the car, he found a third woman in labor in the backseat. “It was going to happen pretty quick, and I knew they weren’t gonna make it to the hospital,” he said. So Evans got a first aid kit from his truck, put on a pair of gloves and helped deliver the baby boy. “He put his gloves on and got his umbilical cord from around his neck, and he helped me deliver,” new mom Desire’e Thomas told WAPT-TV. Evans said he believes his Marine Corps training kicked in.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new effort in St. Louis County will make the overdose-reversing antidote naloxone more readily available to the public, in hopes of reducing the high number of opioid overdose deaths in the state’s largest county. Democratic County Executive Sam Page on Monday announced details of a program that will make naloxone available free of charge to community groups and the public during regular business hours at the county’s John C. Murphy Health Center in Berkeley. County officials said the site was chosen because of its location in north St. Louis County, the area hit hardest by the epidemic. U.S. health officials believe the increasing availability of naloxone, commonly known under the brand name Narcan, is partly responsible for the first drop in overdose deaths in nearly 30 years.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: An investigation has started after seven trumpeter swans were found dead at a pond near the city, wildlife officials said. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks received a report of dead swans between the towns of Belgrade and Manhattan on Friday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Biologists and wardens collected the animals’ bodies Saturday, department spokesman Morgan Jacobson said. “We still don’t have a cause of death,” Jacobson said, adding that the agency has not ruled out any causes including poaching or the swans eating moldy grain. Trumpeter swans are on the state’s species of concern list, according to Montana Field Guides’ website. The list helps resource managers make decisions about species conservation and data collection priorities. Trumpeter swans are the largest waterfowl in North America, experts said. They can be up to 5 feet (in length, have a wingspan up to about 7 feet and weigh over 20 pounds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has been chosen to lead a team of universities and other partners in studying counterterrorism and terrorism prevention, federal officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Monday that the university has won a $3.65 million-a-year grant for 10 years. The university will spearhead a consortium of academic, industry, government and laboratory partners in trying to find ways to prevent or counteract threats to the nation’s people, infrastructure and economy, the directorate said. That consortium constitutes what the directorate describes as a center of excellence. It will be the directorate’s 10th center of excellence, said directorate spokesman John Verrico.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: State officials issued another marijuana health advisory regarding products that were on shelves at 30 dispensaries in Nevada last month. The Nevada Department of Taxation issued an advisory late Friday concerning 20 products that failed microbial testing conducted by an independent lab. The products were sold in the form of raw cannabis buds and raw cannabis that had been pre-rolled into a joint. The products came from six different cultivators in Nevada and failed a variety of mold, yeast and bacteria testing. All of the products were initially tested and passed by Cannex LLC, a Las Vegas marijuana testing lab that the taxation department suspended in December as part of an investigation. The products were on the shelves between Oct. 25 and Jan. 16 at dispensaries across the state. There are no known reports of illness, according to the taxation officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers are working on a bill that would require more insurance coverage for people in the state who get tick-borne disease testing. Rep. Megan Murray, a first-term Democrat from Amherst, said her constituents have told her that doctors often prioritize testing for Lyme disease after a tick bite, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Murray’s bill, which has bipartisan co-sponsors, would require insurers to cover additional advanced, broad tests that could catch Lyme and other more rare diseases. Murray said she hopes that testing for these diseases earlier will prevent delayed diagnoses, as well as lower costs for patients and insurers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHoboken: The city, one of the areas in the state hit hardest by Superstorm Sandy, is making progress toward completing a large public park that will double as a reservoir for nearly 2 million gallons of storm water to prevent it from flooding city streets. On Monday, officials announced the awarding of a $14 million federal grant to continue construction of the 5-acre park, which sits in the northwest corner of the city on the former site of a chemical plant, about a mile from the Lincoln Tunnel into New York. The project has been under construction for about five months and is expected to be completed in late 2022. The park will feature green space, athletic fields, an ice skating rink and other amenities. A 30-foot-deep underground tank will hold up to a million gallons of water that normally would collect in city streets, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It was the 1970s when the state last increased the amount of bond money that oil and gas companies are required to put up before drilling. As development continues at a record pace, State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says it’s time to take another look. Legislation that called for a study of the issue stalled during the recent session, but Garcia Richard announced just a day after lawmakers adjourned that she’s moving forward with the effort. She said her office has the funding to begin the work. The review could take months. Given all the infrastructure and development on state trust lands, officials said the amount of bonding needed to ensure taxpayers aren’t left paying for any cleanup and restoration after oil, gas or other minerals are extracted is currently unknown. Garcia Richard described it as an urgent issue that could leave “taxpayers and our state trust land beneficiaries on the hook for potentially millions of dollars.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York State Police say they plan to go forward with a body camera pilot program for state troopers, a move that would change the agency’s status as one of the few primary state law enforcement agencies in the nation without body or dashboard cameras. Kevin Bruen, first deputy superintendent of the New York State Police, disclosed the plan for a pilot program Monday at the state Capitol. He did not provide details of the plan, such as how many troopers will receive the devices and how much money the pilot program might cost. Patrol cameras are regularly praised by law enforcement experts as ways to increase transparency and hold officers and citizens accountable. Equipping state police with body cameras has received support from New York Attorney General Letitia James. Some state lawmakers have also expressed support for bringing the technology to the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in 2016 to limit the power of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper before he could take office now want the state’s highest court to hear their case. Lawyers for Common Cause and ten citizens filed an appeal petition with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, about a month after the Court of Appeals upheld the legality of the three-day session in December 2016. Republicans in charge of the House and Senate approved a pair of measures during the session that weakened Cooper’s power as governor. Those who sued said the fleetness of GOP leaders calling the session and pushing through legislation violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to “instruct their representatives.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A city building dubbed Sandbag Central will soon be open for business as Fargo leaders prepare for spring flooding along the Red River, the city administrator said Monday night. Bruce Grubb told city commissioners of plans to fill 250,000 sandbags in order to protect the city to 41 feet, which would be 23 feet over flood stage. The latest outlook from the National Weather Service shows a 10% probability that the river will reach 39 feet in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area. KFGO radio reports Grubb called the chance of a severe flood “a flip of the coin” and said the city would rather “err on the side of caution.” Volunteers filled hundreds of thousands of sandbags last year for anticipated flooding that never materialized. Sandbag Central is located in a building that is normally a parking garage for garbage trucks. Plans are to begin sandbag operations March 10.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: Two cheetah cubs have been born through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer to a surrogate mother for the first time, zoo officials announced Monday. The male and female cubs were born to 3-year-old Izzy at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium on Wednesday, the zoo said in a statement. A team observed the births through a remote camera and is continuing to monitor Izzy and the cubs. The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi, who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally. Kibibi’s eggs were extracted and then fertilized in a Columbus Zoo laboratory Nov. 19. The early-stage embryos were implanted into Izzy on Nov. 21, and an ultrasound revealed she was pregnant with two fetuses about a month later. Dr. Randy Junge, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, said this development could have broader implications for managing the species’ population in the future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Children under the age of 17 would be required to wear seat belts in vehicle back seats under a bill narrowly passed Monday by the state Senate. The bill, which passed on a 25-22 vote, changes current law that requires only children younger than age 8 to wear seat belts in the back seat. “The bottom line is children are being hurt and dying simply because we don’t require them to wear a seat belt,” said Sen. Roland Pederson, a Burlington Republican. Pederson said Oklahoma is the nation’s only state that does not require seat belts for children older than age 8. The measure now heads to the House, where a similar bill is pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: House Republicans walked out from the state Capitol on Tuesday, joining their Senate colleagues in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill. “Oregon House Republicans are taking a stand, with working families, in opposing cap and trade and this rigged process,” House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, said in a statement. House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she has and will continue to make an effort toward compromise, but that isn’t possible if Republicans are not in the Capitol. In a stream of statements released Tuesday morning, House Republicans cited the process of crafting Senate Bill 1530, as well as the policy itself, as their reasons for leaving. Republicans have said SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say that cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state’s carbon emissions and that the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An inmate awaiting trial in a shooting case wants a federal judge to release him from solitary confinement in a central Pennsylvania county jail, where he has been confined for more than a year because he refuses to cut dreadlocks that hold religious significance for him. The hand-written lawsuit filed in October by Eric S. McGill Jr. against three senior administrators at the Lebanon County Correctional Facility shifted gears last week, when a set of lawyers produced an amended complaint that warned McGill’s mental health is deteriorating. It said McGill, 27, of Lebanon, an adherent of Rastafarianism, suffers anxiety attacks two or three times a week, and they are usually triggered by thoughts of his jail conditions and placement in solitary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two state lawmakers are proposing to raise taxes on residents earning more than $500,000 annually to pay for education. Democratic state Sen. Ryan Pearson, of Cumberland, and Democratic Rep. Gregg Amore, of East Providence, are proposing a new tax bracket for income earned higher than $500,000. It would add 1 percentage point to the 5.99% top rate, with incremental revenue directed to an account for funding education from kindergarten through grade 12, they said. They emphasized that their proposal would not affect any resident earning less than $500,000 annually. Amore said the state needs a commitment of resources to pay for reforms to the education system. Pearson said that by asking the top 1% of earners in Rhode Island to contribute more, there will be funding to ensure that all Rhode Islanders can get a good education.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An April performance by the Hong Kong Ballet at the Peace Center has been canceled due to concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. The ballet was set to perform “ALICE (in wonderland)” on April 21 with the help of dozens of local ballet students. The company postponed its upcoming U.S. tour due to the virus. Hong Kong Ballet Artistic Director Septime Webre said the group is putting the health and safety of its dancers and the general public first but is committed to returning to South Carolina in the coming seasons. Auditions were held in late January to choose local ballet students to fill roles in the show, and rehearsals had already begun. Anyone who’s already purchased tickets will automatically receive a refund based on their method of payment, according to a release from the Peace Center.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a proposal to stop schools from requiring students to get vaccinations. A House committee heard emotional testimony from parents on both sides of the issue but decided to effectively kill the bill, saying it would have resulted in decreased vaccination rates and could have caused outbreaks in vaccine-preventable diseases. Supporters of the bill said South Dakota is the first state Legislature this year to consider a proposal to end school vaccine requirements, but the issue is now being carried by lawmakers in a few other states. They hoped that despite the bill’s defeat, their doubts about vaccinations would gain credence in the state. Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the bill and told reporters last week that vaccinations have saved millions of lives. Doctors, as well as lobbyists from medical groups, hospitals, business groups, universities and schools, also lined up to testify against the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state on Monday set two new execution dates, days after putting to death its seventh inmate in the past year and a half. The Tennessee Supreme Court ordered an Oct. 8 execution date for Byron Black and a Dec. 3 execution date for Pervis Payne. Black was convicted by a Nashville court of murdering his girlfriend Angela Clay and her daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6, at their home in 1988. Prosecutors said he shot the three during a jealous rage. Black was on work release at the time for shooting and wounding Clay’s estranged husband. Payne was sentenced to death in Memphis for the 1987 fatal stabbing of Charisse Christopher and her daughter, Lacie Jo, in what prosecutors described as a “drug-induced frenzy.” Christopher’s son, Nicholas, who was 3 at the time, was stabbed but survived. Attorneys for the inmates have argued that both men are intellectually disabled and mentally ill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: This week the state Department of Transportation could approve a request from Gov. Greg Abbott to rent a state-owned temporary campsite for the homeless to an Austin nonprofit. But the residents have another idea: They want the governor to lease the property directly to them. In an open letter to Abbott, those who have taken shelter at the campsite they are calling Camp R.A.T.T., which stands for Responsible Adult Transition Town, said they would be willing to pay $1 a month per resident to rent the land. Abbott is offering a $1-a-month lease to ATX Helps, a nonprofit tied to the Austin Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Austin Alliance. “We believe this is a good idea for several reasons: it gives the residents here a sense of responsibility, and provides the basis of stewardship,” the letter said. “Also, we aren’t lazy and aren’t expecting a hand-out. It’s our intention to get back into the world.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Most abortions would be banned in the state under a new proposal at the Legislature – one that abortion-rights advocates say would create fear and uncertainty even though it wouldn’t be enforced unless the legal landscape changes. The proposal would make it a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison to perform an abortion except in cases of rape, incest or serious threat to the health of the mother. The bill contains a so-called trigger clause, so the measure wouldn’t go into effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion in the country. The trigger clause also means it likely could not be immediately challenged in court. Utah passed a ban after 18 weeks last year, and lawmakers are considering additional abortion-related proposal this year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a bill that would increase the minimum wage. The vote was 100 to 49. The Senate, which has a Democrat majority, voted 24-6 in favor of the veto override earlier this month. The original bill did not pass the Democrat-led House with the two-thirds margin that would be needed to override the governor’s veto, but some lawmakers changed their votes Tuesday. Scott has said that raising the minimum wage to $12.55 by 2022 could end up hurting the people it is intended to help.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A judge has hit the pause button on the city’s plans to remove a 175-year-old slave auction block from a downtown street corner. The Free Lance-Star reports Circuit Court Judge Sarah Deneke has agreed to a 15-day stay of her order to remove the block in Fredericksburg. Her order allows a business owner who is challenging the removal to ask the Virginia Supreme Court to take on the case. E.D. Cole Building LLC owns a commercial building across the street from the auction block. The firm and the owner of a nearby restaurant have argued that they’ll lose business from tourist traffic if the auction block is removed. The judge already ruled that city officials have the authority to approve the removal the block. The city had previously placed traffic cones around the block with plans to move it before the business owner urged the court to stop the city.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Weekly benefits under the state’s new paid family leave law are now taking up to 10 weeks to process because of the high number of people applying for the program. Under the law, eligible workers receive 12 weeks’ paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious medical condition of the worker or the worker’s family member, or 16 weeks for a combination of both. An additional two weeks may be used if there is a serious health condition with a pregnancy. Weekly benefits under the new law are calculated based on a percentage of the employee’s wages and the state’s weekly average wage – which is now $1,255 – though the weekly amount paid out is capped at $1,000. In the first six weeks since the program went live last month, more than 30,000 people have applied, more than triple the amount that was projected in that same time frame, according to the Washington Employment Security Department.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican state lawmakers moved forward Monday on a sweeping tax overhaul that could slash county government budgets, though it appears likely Democrats may derail the plan. Senators voted 17-16 to pass a GOP proposal to cut taxes on manufacturers and personal vehicles while raising sales taxes and taxes on tobacco products. But still looming is an accompanying resolution, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, to set the plan in motion. “This is a bad plan; it’s going to hurt West Virginians,” said Sen. Mike Romano, a Democrat from Harrison County. Many county leaders oppose the tax overhaul and worry it could result in the loss of millions of dollars in tax revenues that play an integral part of their budgets. Jonathan Adler, executive director of the West Virginia Association of Counties, said the plan raised the potential for devastating cuts to local law enforcement and courts.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Authorities say three people died in snowmobile accidents last weekend, boosting the number of deaths to 17 for the season. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said all three of the victims were from Illinois. Two of them died after striking trees, and one person was killed after being struck by another snowmobile rider. There have been nine fatalities this month. That includes a 15-year-old Wisconsin boy who failed to stop at an intersection of a public trail and highway and collided with a car, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who struck a fence on private land and a 29-year-old woman who struck several trees. Alcohol, excess speed and driver inexperience are the leading causes of snowmobile accidents, according to the DNR.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The National Park Service is about to begin facility and trail work totaling almost $4 million in Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming. The work will include making an overlook trail more accessible to people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations. Plans also call for improving access to restrooms, a visitor center and a trail to the base of Devils Tower. Parking lots, visitor center exhibits and trail signs also will see improvements. Funding will come from a variety of sources including a portion of entrance fees, the Gillette News-Record reports. “It’s been a long time planned and a long time coming to make sure that all these funding sources came together for us,” said Nick Myers, the national monument’s chief of interpretation. Work is expected to begin this week, weather permitting, and should be done by November, Myers said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/20/dancing-street-dior-doug-pug-news-around-states/39499443/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the Capitol on Sunday to protest the state’s newly approved abortion ban – the most stringent in the nation, making performing an abortion a felony, with no exception even for rape or incest – chanting “my body, my choice!” and “vote them out!” Similar demonstrations were held in Birmingham and Huntsville on Sunday. Alabama is part of a wave of conservative states seeking to mount new legal challenges to Roe v. Wade. None of the laws has actually taken effect, and all are expected to be blocked by the courts as the legal challenges play out with an ultimate eye on the Supreme Court. Amanda Reyes, who runs Yellowhammer Fund, a nonprofit that provides funding to help low-income women obtain abortions, says donations have begun streaming in since the bill’s passage.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: Supporters of Storyknife Writers Retreat attended groundbreaking ceremonies this month for a main house and cabins that will house visiting female authors, the Homer News reports. Storyknife founder Dana Stabenow turned the first bit of earth at the property just north of Homer on May 4. Stabenow, the best-selling author of the Kate Shugak mystery series, spoke of being inspired to start a residency program just for women after attending the nation’s only other such facility, Hedgebrook on Whidbey Island, Washington. When Storybrook is finished, there will be six cabins and a main house, Eva, named after poet Eva Saulitis, where writers will congregate after a day’s work. The complex is expected to be ready by next spring, when the first group of writers attends. For more information on Storyknife, visit www.storyknife.org.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Diamondbacks have recruited their cutest, furriest player yet – Brenly, a 6-month-old golden retriever working to become a certified therapy dog and raise awareness of issues faced by abused, neglected and at-risk children, according to a statement from the baseball team. Brenly was named after sportscaster and former Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly, says his trainer, Blake Blackman-Woody from Gabriel’s Angels, which provides pet therapy for at-risk children. The pup drew a crowd at the ballpark Sunday and proved cool and collected when swarmed by groups of children and fans at Chase Field’s Phoenix Children’s Hospital Sandlot. Brenly will be at the ballpark spreading love and comfort for six Sunday games this season to help prepare him for his certification test, says Debbie Castaldo, vice president of corporate and community impact for the Diamondbacks.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he will hire an Indiana company to operate five state youth prisons, despite lawmakers’ concerns about the company’s operations in other states. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Arkansas Legislative Council voted 9-5 Friday against a contract with Youth Opportunity Investments LLC, but the governor has said he will override that vote. Lawmakers say Youth Opportunity has been issued more than a dozen written citations for poor performance in other states, and they criticize what they say was a cursory review of the company. Gov. Hutchinson says that he was “disappointed” with the lawmakers’ decision and that youth facilities are monitored closely to ensure children are cared for “properly and safely.” Youth Opportunity will begin operating facilities in Dermott, Harrisburg, Lewisville and Mansfield on July 1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCorona: A new assessment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers raises concern about the potential for failure of the spillway of a flood control dam on a Southern California river where 1.4 million people live downstream. The Corps says it has changed the risk characterization of Prado Dam from moderate urgency to high urgency. Prado Dam is located on the Santa Ana River in Corona, about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The 96-mile river begins in the San Bernardino Mountains and runs through inland Southern California and Orange County to the ocean. It typically has little water flow except during winter, when storms can turn it into a raging torrent that historically caused serious floods. The dam, which otherwise is typically dry, was designed in the 1930s and constructed in 1941.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse is calling for an investigation to be reopened into allegations that the National Park Service tried to remove references to human-caused climate change from a University of Colorado researcher’s report. The Denver Post reported Sunday that the Colorado Democrat is urging the U.S. Department of the Interior’s inspector general to relaunch the probe that was closed when the park service ultimately published Maria Caffrey’s report, which examined projected sea level rise at coastal parks, without edits last year. Neguse says the incident raises questions about whether department researchers are “able to do their work free from political influence.” Caffrey declined comment, citing involvement in legal negotiations. The newspaper could not reach National Park Service and Department of Interior officials Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers are collecting clothing donations for veterans looking to join the workforce. Democratic state Rep. Dorinda Borer of West Haven and Sen. James Maroney of Milford, the co-chairs of the General Assembly’s Veteran Affairs Committee, have joined forces with other state lawmakers, the nonprofit Save-A-Suit organization and the Max Cares Foundation to hold the fourth annual Save-A-Suit Drive at the state Capitol in Hartford. The May 30 event will be held from 9 a.m. to about 5 p.m. Donations of gently used, dry-cleaned or new clothing will be accepted outside the state Capitol building, weather permitting. Organizers say they’re looking for men’s suits, blazers, pants, shirts, ties, sweaters, coats, belts, shoes and accessories. For women, they’re seeking suits, tops, pants, dresses, skirts, bags, shoes and scarves.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Cabot, a 533-pound white shark that recently appeared off the state’s coast, is likely among the early-bird crowd of sharks that will be heading north along the East Coast as southern waters begin to warm. Besides making local headlines, Cabot’s recent First State rest stop also marks some great news for big-fish fans who care about the health of the ocean, says Chris Fischer, founder and expedition leader of the OCEARCH research and education team, which he brought on an expedition in the Delaware Bay two years ago. “What we learned there is that the sharks are likely just kind of passing through,” he says. “It’s a fantastic sign for your bay if the sharks are coming by and pausing there. It means there’s abundant life, and you’re doing a good job managing resources.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro will start running all Yellow Line trains to Greenbelt, Maryland, this Saturday, a month ahead of schedule, WUSA-TV reports. The change comes as the system begins a giant improvement project that will close six Yellow and Blue line stations south of Reagan National Airport. “By making this change now, we can better serve our customers impacted by the summer-long closures,” Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a release. Metro said a recent weekend simulation of what this summer will look like showed officials that extending all Yellow Line trains to Greenbelt would improve train spacing, reduce congestion and “maintain Metro’s commitment to operate normal service outside of the shutdown area.” The unprecedented three-month shutdown aims to fix crumbling outdoor station platforms that have been worn away by the elements.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A federal judge says 32 more counties in the state must provide election materials and ballots in Spanish. A recent order from U.S. District Judge Mark Walker expanded a temporary injunction that he granted ahead of last fall’s elections. Under Walker’s latest order, election supervisors in the 32 counties must provide ballots in Spanish by March 2020, when the presidential primary election is held. Fifteen counties already do so. Walker’s order would raise the total to almost four dozen of Florida’s 67 counties. If a county holds an election before then, elections supervisors must provide sample ballots in Spanish. The order also says election supervisors must have a bilingual hotline to assist Spanish-speaking voters during early voting, provide information in Spanish on their website and recruit bilingual poll workers.\n\nGeorgia\n\nEllijay: A north Georgia community has come up with a unique approach to emergency medicine. WABE Radio reports that Gilmer County residents were concerned about three years ago when the local hospital prepared to close, as not having a hospital can jeopardize the health of residents and can also scare off business owners who consider locating there. The CEO of Piedmont Mountainside Hospital about 20 miles away saw an opportunity in the local facility’s closing. By opening a free-standing emergency room in Gilmer County, officials could take pressure off Piedmont Mountainside’s ER and hold on to their 30-35% market share in Gilmer County. The emergency room opened about a year after the old hospital closed. WABE reports it’s among the first of its kind in the region.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Staff from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are settling into another temporary office in Hilo, their third move since the Kilauea volcano eruption forced the evacuation of their headquarters in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports Tina Neal, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory’s chief scientist, says the relocation should be complete by the end of the month and expects no glitches in the monitoring of active volcanos. The agency is awaiting congressional approval of a bill that would allocate disaster recover funds to construct new headquarters. Neal says Hawaii Island will remain its base, even if some staffers relocate to Oahu, which she says is being considered for additional technical capacity. The former headquarters on Kilauea was heavily damaged during numerous collapses and earthquakes last year.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: A former Idaho State University professor wants to solve a 1970s death mystery and is raising money to find additional clues. The Idaho Falls Post Register reports Amy Michael is raising money for DNA testing on cut-up human remains found in Buffalo Cave, also known as the Civil Defense Cave, in east Idaho near the Montana border. A family searching for arrowheads found a male torso in 1979. The arms and legs were found 12 years later. The head has not been located. Clark County Chief Deputy John Clements says cuts on the body parts indicate someone dismembered the man with a saw. Michael hopes new forensic DNA testing can help identify the dead man and says she needs $2,300 to perform the tests. She had raised $470 as of Wednesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A wildlife biologist has taken prairie chickens from Kansas, which has a more robust population, and released them in Illinois in an effort to boost the population of the endangered birds. The Chicago Tribune reports that the birds once numbered in the millions across the Prairie State, but there are now just about 200 left. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published a pioneering scientific report last week on biodiversity that found that 1 million species, including the prairie chicken, remain imperiled. Illinois Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist Bob Gillespie says a recent translocation project that captured prairie chickens from Kansas and freed them into the Prairie Ridge preserve has helped the birds stave off extinction.\n\nIndiana\n\nHuntertown: A conservation group says it planted 55,000 native hardwood saplings this spring on more than 100 acres of marginal farmland. ACRES Land Trust says the reforesting efforts at three of its nature preserves represent the most trees it’s planted in a single year. The organization credits planning, donors and volunteer support for its brisk tree-planting pace. The Journal Gazette reports that the group reforested 80 acres of the Walter H. and E. Marie Myers Nature Preserve near the northern Indiana community of Chili, 17 acres of the James P. Covell Nature Preserve near Auburn and 9 acres at the James M. & Patricia D. Barrett Nature Preserve near Huntertown. Since 2016, the nonprofit has reforested 165 acres by planting nearly 100,000 trees at six nature preserves.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An unmarked street curb has cost city taxpayers nearly $1.7million after cyclists involved in bike crashes there sued the city over their injuries. The city has settled two such cases and now faces a third. Des Moines installed the curb in March 2017 at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and Southwest 16th Street. It was part of an intersection redesign to direct pedestrians to a brick crosswalk across the road just south of downtown. In several lawsuits filed against the city, cyclists claimed they were injured after striking the unmarked curb while riding east on the trail. The 6-inch curb, which has since been removed, cut off what was previously a straight path for cyclists using the Martin Luther King Jr. Trail, forcing them to veer left to reach the ramp at the crosswalk.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: Hispanic residents make up more than half of the population in Ford, Finney and Seward counties, but there is only one Hispanic elected official in all three southwestern Kansas counties and their three largest cities. KCUR-FM reports that some groups want to recruit more Hispanic candidates so residents can choose leaders who truly represent them. Karem Gallo, president of the Liberal chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, says the group has been working to let Latino residents know they have support to seek public office. Garden City School Board member Tim Cruz says money and time remain the biggest hurdles, while Finney County Commissioner William Clifford points to the county Republican Party’s failure to recruit immigrant groups. Clifford, who chairs the party, says immigrants deserve representation.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has lashed out at protesting teachers and ridiculed judges during a tumultuous term steering the commonwealth on a conservative course. Now the pugnacious governor faces the first test of his re-election campaign in a race that could offer clues about the electorate’s mood heading into a presidential election year. Voters get to speak Tuesday in a state where the GOP has recently dominated but Democrats see an opportunity to win back the governorship. Three prominent Democrats, including the son of Bevin’s predecessor, are competing for the chance to challenge Bevin. The leading Democrats are Attorney General Andy Beshear, ex-state auditor Adam Edelen and longtime state Rep. Rocky Adkins. Beshear’s father served two terms as governor. Bevin has three Republican primary challengers, including state Rep. Robert Goforth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s debt load has declined for the first time in a decade, a notable benchmark as Louisiana tries to get a handle on its finances after years of budget gaps and record borrowing. But the amount Louisiana owes for every man, woman and child still outstrips the national average. An updated debt report presented to the State Bond Commission shows Louisiana’s per capita, tax-supported debt dipped to $1,497 in 2018. That’s down $61 per person from $1,558 a year earlier, as the state works to shrink its outstanding obligations for construction projects. It was the first drop in the debt load since 2008, after years of continued rises. Louisiana owes an amount per state resident that is lower than in 2014, when it hovered slightly above $1,500.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: With recreational marijuana legalization in sight, the state is looking to learn from mistakes its counterparts have made in legalizing the drug. The state’s proposed marijuana rules will be the subject of a public hearing in Portland on Thursday that officials expect will be well attended. It’s the latest step on the road to a legal framework that pot lovers and state officials say they hope will weed out problems such as oversupply and underage use that have cropped up elsewhere. Maine voters chose to legalize adult use marijuana in 2016, but the legal sales haven’t started because of trouble implementing laws as political squabbles slow the process. The state now has draft rules in hand that could govern subjects such as licensure and cultivation, and the Legislature must approve them.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Assateague Coastal Trust is bringing back its internationally recognized Swim Guide water quality monitoring program to monitor and report on the health of area waterways. Swim Guide is a smartphone app that enables users to find safe beaches and swimming areas to recreate and enjoy the waterways through a simple platform that relays local area water quality, according to a news release. The app is available at the Apple App Store, Google Play and Theswimguide.org. The program will run through Labor Day weekend. This year the organization is monitoring 10 locations throughout Herring and Turville Creek, Isle of Wight Bay, Assawoman Bay and the St. Martin River, according to a news release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by Alexander Hamilton in 1780 to the Marquis de Lafayette that was stolen from the state archives decades ago has been found, and now an effort is underway to return it. The U.S. attorney’s office in Boston filed a forfeiture complaint in federal court last week asking a judge to order the Revolutionary War-era letter returned to its rightful owner. Hamilton’s letter was stolen by an archives employee sometime between 1937 and 1945, according to the government. “The theft, which also involved original papers of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere and Benedict Arnold, among others, was not discovered for several years,” the federal complaint says. Most of the other documents were recovered, but Hamilton’s letter remained missing. The letter to the French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army appears to detail the movements of British forces.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Motown Museum has created a park that was unveiled Sunday in conjunction with a celebration of its founder, Esther Gordy Edwards. Thousands headed to Hitsville, U.S.A., to salute the homegrown music legacy. Dancing in the Street Park was officially inaugurated with a spirited “Dancing in the Street” by Martha Reeves in a rare public reunion with the original Vandellas, Rosalind Ashford-Holmes and Annette Beard. Young performers from the museum’s summer-camp programs stepped up for often-impressive renditions of Motown classics by Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and the Temptations, as Reeves sat nearby keeping time with a handheld shaker. Mayor Mike Duggan was among those on hand for the opening of the cozy plaza next to the Hitsville building, located in the former home of Motown Records’ offices and studio. The lot had sat vacant since 1971, when the office-house there was destroyed in a fire.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials say the state needs more community paramedics to assist residents leaving the hospital in managing chronic health conditions at home. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that the state agency says there are 127 certified community paramedics, nearly half working in the Twin Cities. Regions Hospital in St. Paul has partnered with the city’s fire department and a health clinic on a three-year community paramedic program. The project made nearly 1,000 home visits to help people manage diabetes and high blood pressure. Nearly half of the program’s hypertension patients lowered their blood pressure to a healthy level, while almost 80% of diabetic patients reduced blood sugar levels. Aaron Burnett, who oversees the program, says patients are coming back to the hospital less and are more satisfied with their care.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition is gearing up for a summer nutrition program to help needy families. The group is extending its weekend backpack program that provides food for families of children who qualify for free and reduced-price school meals. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports that the coalition aims to feed up to 800 students this summer through its Break Box program. Coalition director Jason Martin says 20% of Lee County residents are considered to be food insecure. Summer food boxes are filled with shelf-stable items, including milk, juice, canned vegetables and fruit, and protein, like chicken and tuna. The boxes will also include meals that children can heat in a microwave, plus snack items. The coalition will distribute boxes monthly in June, July and August.\n\nMissouri\n\nEl Dorado Springs: Scientists are preparing to end a seven-year program that has reintroduced the first federally endangered species to the state because the beetles are showing signs they could survive on their own. The St. Louis Zoo has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Nature Conservancy to restore American burying beetles in Missouri since 2012. The program has released more than 2,800 American burying beetles in the soil at Wah’Kon-Tah Prairie near El Dorado Springs. Merz tells the Joplin Globe that the program has seen “positive trends that indicate it is time to see how the beetles are doing on their own.” Merz says scientists will continue to monitor the species, but the beetles will have to find their own food sources.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest has grown with the acquisition of about 620 acres. The Independent Record reports that the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has transferred ownership of the Green Mountain National Trails property to the U.S. Forest Service, opening the land to the public. Foundation chief conservation officer Blake Henning says the land about 35 miles east of Lincoln is within the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail corridor and the Continental Divide Grizzly Bear Recovery Area. The land also contains part of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. The foundation says the trail was rerouted out of the private property to public lands several years ago, but the trail will now be restored to its historic route.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Ten artistic additions to the city have been installed as the inaugural Norfolk Sculpture Walk officially began this month. The 10 sculptures that will be featured this year include lifelike bronze statues, steel creations up to 7 feet high and intricate works of stone. Traci Jeffrey, director of the Norfolk Area Visitors Bureau, told the Norfolk Daily News there’s something everyone will enjoy. Those partaking in the sculpture walk are encouraged to vote for a favorite online. The winner will be announced at the Riverpoint Arts Festival in September. Each sculpture is also for sale. The Norfolk Sculpture Walk was inspired by other such walks around the region and brought to the city by a committee of area residents, artists and the Norfolk Area Visitors Bureau in partnership with the City of Norfolk, the Norfolk Area Chamber of Commerce, the Norfolk Arts Center and numerous sponsors.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has approved $75,000 for a contractor to assess hazards and clean up waste at a site north of the city that’s polluted with ammunition casings left by target shooters. Kurt Miers, an environmental protection specialist for the agency, says the piles of casings have contaminated the soil with lead. He says the contamination is as much as four times what’s considered the maximum allowable level for lead in residential areas. The site near Chimney Road at the north end of Sun Valley is near hundreds of homes and a middle school under construction. Target shooting is allowed on most public lands but illegal within 5,000 feet of homes.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: An analysis says the Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad in the state accounts for more than $17.4 million in total economic impact annually. The report released by Stone Consulting of Warren, Pennsylvania, says that amount affects nearly 380 full- and part-time jobs in the restaurant, hospitality and retail sectors. The railroad operates excursions from Lincoln, Meredith and Weirs Beach. The report says last year, 61% of its passengers traveled from outside New Hampshire, resulting in $8.8 million in additional spending while visiting. In 2018, the railroad welcomed more than 260 bus tours, which accounted for nearly 12,000 additional guests to the region, and more than 50% stayed overnight after traveling on the railroad.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Oprah Winfrey announced she’s giving $500,000 to an initiative at a high school that’s aimed at keeping kids off the streets. Principal Akbar Cook’s “Lights On” program keeps West Side High School in Newark open on Friday nights from 6 p.m. to midnight. WPVI-TV reports kids can play basketball, shoot pool, play video games or even use a recording studio. Winfrey’s gift will help the program operate three nights a week over the summer. She told hundreds of cheering students Friday during a surprise visit that she was inspired by “all of the great things that are happening here.” Cook also garnered headlines last fall for installing washing machines so students who couldn’t afford to wash their clothes wouldn’t miss school because they were being bullied for wearing dirty clothes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: Two counties in the state remain among the top oil-producing counties in the U.S., according to new federal numbers. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Lea County was the No. 2 oil-producing county in January, behind North Dakota’s McKenzie County, The Hobbs News-Sun reports. Lea County produced 14.6 million barrels of oil in January, the report says. Meanwhile, New Mexico’s Eddy County was listed as the No. 6 top oil-producing county. It produced 10 million barrels during the same month. In November, a group of major oil and gas companies with plays in the Permian Basin announced the formation of an energy alliance, collectively committing more than $100 million over the next several years to spur additional private-sector investment in the region.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: The U.S. Coast Guard says work is underway to extract oil from a British tanker sunk by a German U-boat off Long Island during World War II. The Coast Guard says in a news release that a team has been at the site of the tanker, named Coimbra, since April 29 and has pumped more than 62,000 gallons of oil from its tanks since May 11. Initial dive operations found the tanker was leaking small amounts of oil. The Coimbra was torpedoed in January 1942, killing 36 officers and crew members about 30 miles off Long Island’s south shore. It’s now about 180 feet deep. German U-boats sank 148 petroleum tankers and countless other ships near the U.S. Gulf and East coasts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: Long-awaited passenger-only ferry service between two popular Outer Banks destinations is finally sailing. The Department of Transportation says runs between Hatteras and Ocracoke villages began Monday with two free preview days. It costs $1 per person starting Wednesday. Currently space will be first-come, first-serve. State ferries already transport people and their vehicles for free between the southern end of Hatteras Island and northern tip of Ocracoke Island. Motorists then drive 12 miles to reach Ocracoke Village. The passenger-only ferry will run three times daily through Sept. 5. There’s no extra charge for bicycles. Passenger-only service was supposed to begin last year but got delayed by boat construction issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state is once again tops in the nation in the production of honey. The Agriculture Department says producers with five or more colonies totaled 38.2 million pounds of honey in 2018, up 13% from the previous year. That led the nation for the 15th consecutive year. The number of honey-producing colonies in North Dakota was up 16% to 530,000. Average yield was down 2 pounds, to 72 pounds per colony. The total value of honey produced in the state was up 12%, to $71.7 million. Nationally, honey production was up 2%, to 152 million pounds. Montana produced the second-most honey, followed by California, South Dakota and Florida.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is expanding its Eastern black rhino exhibit to more than twice its current size to accommodate its herd of five rhinos. A zoo release says the $1.5 million expansion will be paid for by the Cleveland Zoological Society and Cleveland Metroparks. It also will include an expanded viewing deck for guests. Other renovations will add an indoor rhino barn, a wallowing pool, and shading and misting areas to cool the rhinos. Zoo Executive Director Chris Kuhar says expansion of the exhibit in the zoo’s African Savanna area will allow staff to better care for the herd. He says the Eastern black rhino is one of the world’s most endangered species. Construction will begin this fall and is expected to finish in the spring of 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials monitoring the state’s Department of Human Services have said the agency’s child-welfare system has had its best performance to date but have also warned it needs to increase the number of foster homes for children who require therapeutic care. The Tulsa World reports that the biannual assessment released Friday says the department made “good faith efforts” in 29 of the 31 criteria measuring child welfare. The oversight panel also says the department has seen a 77% decline in specialized foster homes for children in state custody who need therapeutic care. The reports are issued twice a year by monitors as part of a 2012 settlement that alleged foster children were victimized in state care.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A multifaceted gun control bill pushed by Democrats in the Legislature may be dead this session, but advocates and opponents alike are confident it will return. Senate Bill 978 was a casualty of the deal that got Senate Republicans to end their four-day walkout and return to the Capitol, allowing Democrats to pass a multibillion-dollar education revenue bill May 13. The move to include SB978 in the trade disappointed gun control advocates inside and outside the Capitol. The measure would have required safe gun storage; placed liability on gun owners if a gun is stolen, but not reported, and used to injure a person or property; outlawed untraceable and undetectable firearms; granted local authorities the power to regulate firearm access in public buildings; and allowed retailers to set higher minimum purchasing age restrictions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: The state has the nation’s highest debt among its recent college graduates, according to Peterson’s financial aid survey, an annual voluntary survey of four-year colleges and universities. The survey uncovered that the average loan debt is $36,193 for a 2017 graduate of a Pennsylvania school, compared to the national average of $28,288. Michael Brown, a data analyst for LendEDU, studied the numbers and found that schools in the Northeast consistently ranked among the highest in the nation for debt per student. “I think, just in general, the cost of living in this part of the country is just more expensive than it is in other parts of the country,” Brown said. Loans may cover everything the student can’t afford to pay, including tuition, housing, food and transportation costs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRichmond: The state has created breeding wetlands to support the endangered Eastern spadefoot toad. The Westerly Sun reports that the state Department of Environmental Management, the University of Rhode Island and several conservancy organizations have teamed up for “Operation Spadefoot RI” in Richmond. The project aims to build new breeding grounds in areas where the toads are already known to be. Eastern spadefoot toad populations have declined dramatically in the state in recent decades. The toads require specialized wetlands that are vulnerable to disturbance, and much of their habitat has been lost or degraded because of human development. The new wetlands are located on land protected jointly by the Richmond Rural Preservation Land Trust and The Nature Conservancy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: It has been a historic year in the Legislature. This is the first time in the state’s history that nine African American women have served simultaneously in the House of Representatives, a monumental moment shared among a sisterhood of women who say their primary mission is to serve. The African American women serving in the House are Reps. Wendy Brawley of Hopkins, Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orangeburg, Chandra Dillard of Greenville, Rosalyn D. Henderson-Myers of Spartanburg, Patricia Henegan of Bennettsville, Annie E. McDaniel of Winnsboro, J. Anne Parks of Greenwood, Leola Robinson Simpson of Greenville and Krystle Simmons of Ladson. And whether it is their first year or their 28th year in the Legislature, the lawmakers say they are passionate about their service and the difference they can make.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Bronze statues of Presidents George W. Bush and Harry S. Truman have been returned to their spots in downtown Rapid City – and local leaders have picked a spot for the 44th president. The statue of Barack Obama will join 43 other presidents who stand at street corners throughout downtown. Obama’s likeness will be unveiled in a ceremony July 13. The City of Presidents tourist attraction project began in 2000 to honor the legacy of the American presidency. The Rapid City Tribune says the Truman and Bush statues were damaged when they were hit by vehicles. They sustained some dents and scratches and required a new bronze finish from Spearfish sculptor James Michael Maher.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Local canine celebrity Doug the Pug had a big day Monday, as Mayor David Briley has declared May20 “Doug the Pug Day.” Briley designated the date for the local holiday because it’s the birthday of Music City’s furry friend. Monday was also National Rescue Dog Day, which seeks to bring attention to the benefits of adopting a four-legged friend. Doug’s owner, Leslie Mosier, encouraged all of the pug’s fans to engage in “chillin’ hard” and eating “lots of pizza” during the holiday. Doug currently has 2.8 million followers on Twitter and 3.8 million on Instagram, plus more than 6 million likes on Facebook.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The more than 70 years of fashion created by the famed House of Dior will be examined in an exhibit in the city that features almost 200 dresses. “Dior: From Paris to the World” opened Sunday at the Dallas Museum of Art. The exhibit profiles the Parisian fashion house’s founder, Christian Dior, along with subsequent artistic directors, who include Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano. The show also explores Dallas’ link to the fashion house’s history: Christian Dior visited the city in 1947 to receive luxury retailer Neiman Marcus’ award for distinguished service in fashion. That was the same year Dior presented his first collection, which became known as the New Look. The exhibit was previously at the Denver Art Museum. Dallas is its only other U.S. stop.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Students interested in science and technology will soon be able to attend class in an old military plane. The Standard-Examiner reports a Vietnam-era cargo plane has been converted into a classroom for science, technology, engineering and math students and attached to a museum at the Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City. Crews renovated a plane that had been stored at The Hill Aerospace Museum and Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Utah for decades and connected it to the building. The classroom was dedicated in a May 14 ceremony. Museum education instructor Mark Standing told The Standard-Examiner that the classroom will be used for aerospace lessons, science experiments, competitions and other activities.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A high school prankster who damaged school property is finally paying the price – and then some – just in time for his 25th reunion. As a Montpelier High School senior, Michael Burzycki painted and stitched together tarps to create a 60-by-16-foot banner that read “LIVE LONG AND PROSPER CLASS OF 1994.” He and a classmate lugged it up to the school’s roof and triumphantly hung it up outside the auditorium. But water bottles they used to weigh down the corners ended up breaking a window. Principal Peter Clarke didn’t punish him. Instead he handed him a bill for $1,994, due at Burzycki’s 25th reunion. Burzycki told WPTZ-TV that he has the money but wanted to do more, so he started a GoFundMe page for the school that has raised more than $5,000.\n\nVirginia\n\nMelfa: The president of a foundation seeking to establish a four-year university on the state’s Eastern Shore has asked officials to consider committing land at the county industrial park in Melfa to the project. A four-year university could grow to about 2,000 students and result in 1,000 jobs and up to $100 million per year in cash flow, according to the foundation. Terry Malarkey, president of the University of the Eastern Shore of Virginia Foundation, told the Accomack County Board of Supervisors the group wants to recruit “a high-quality” science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health university to set up a branch on the shore. He said if Virginia were considered and ranked as two separate education entities – the Rural Horseshoe and the urban corridor – “rural Virginia comes in 50th in the United States,” while the urban section ranks second, behind only Massachusetts. Combined, Virginia ranks sixth.\n\nWashington\n\nVashon Island: This idyllic island near Seattle known for its counterculture lifestyle and low immunization rates is seeing an increase in the number of children vaccinated for measles and other diseases. Advocates attribute the rising vaccination numbers on Vashon Island to increasingly visible pro-vaccine information, expanded access to shots, and media coverage of measles outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and New York this year. Public health officials say the number of fully immunized kindergartners in the Vashon Island School District jumped by 31% in the past six years, from 56% to nearly 74% in the 2017-18 school year. While the gains are notable, the district still has some of the lowest vaccine rates in the U.S. It’s far below the 95% target needed for herd immunity that a majority of schools across the country hit.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State lawmakers have reconvened for their special session but are pushing back debate on education measures that caused a two-day teacher strike earlier this year. The House of Delegates and the Senate met Monday to take up bills that were vetoed for technical reasons. Legislators were supposed to focus on education this week, but Republican Senate President Mitch Carmichael says the GOP is still working on its proposals. Republicans are expected to push for charter schools and school vouchers, which drew strong opposition from teachers and led to a strike. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have debuted eight education bills that include measures to raise teachers’ pay and put mental health professionals in schools. The extra session comes after lawmakers failed to compromise on education when the regular session ended in March.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An industry expert says the impending bankruptcy of a major frac sand mining company signals the financial woes that could cripple more mines based in the state due to a nationwide oversupply of sand. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that Emerge Energy Services entered into a debt restructuring deal with its lenders last month. The company owns Superior Silica Sands. CEO Rick Shearer says restructuring negotiations are ongoing. The company may file for bankruptcy if a settlement isn’t struck out of court. An energy consulting director at analytics firm IHS Markit says up to 75% of Wisconsin mines that supply oil and gas producers might have to close. Samir Nangia says the oversupply is due to companies building more mines near oil fields in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Hot Springs: Yellowstone National Park is proposing to add more housing for seasonal workers employed by private companies operating inside the park. Park administrators are taking public comment on plans to construct six modular houses and up to 14 RV sites at the Canyon Campground and up to 25 RV sites and a bathhouse near the park’s west entrance. The projects would be paid for by two park concessionaires – Delaware North Corporation and Xanterra. More than 3,000 people work for Yellowstone concessionaires during the peak summer tourist season. A study of the proposals says they would have minimal negative effects on the environment and visitor experiences. Park officials are taking comment on the housing projects through June 14.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/04/metoo-workplace-sexual-harassment-laws-policies-progress/1378191002/", "title": "#MeToo workplace 1 year later: laws pass, policies shift progress slow", "text": "What has changed at work in the year since sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein turned the words \"me\" and \"too\" into an unforgettable hashtag and rallying cry for a generation?\n\nA few examples: McDonald's workers walked off the job in a demonstration aimed at fighting harassment in their restaurants. Powerful men, from celebrity chef Mario Batali to CBS CEO Les Moonves continue to be purged from positions for alleged predatory behavior. Laws have been passed in places like California and New York state aimed at training and awareness. Corporations have altered policies, including Microsoft's move to allow employees who previously had contracts with arbitration clauses to seek remedies in open court.\n\nBut there has also been a backlash: complaints that the movement has gone astray, putting men at risk of punishments that go too far; concern among human resources and other experts that women may have a harder time landing certain positions as some powerful men claim they are afraid to hold one-on-one meetings with female colleagues; women of color and those who earn low wages who have complained that the movement hasn't adequately addressed their concerns.\n\nAnd as the first wave of cases filed in the #MeToo era have their day in court, it remains to be seen if the many fighting such mistreatment far from the spotlight will ultimately get justice.\n\n\"I'm not seeing any easier path for women to get to legal remedies as a result of the #MeToo movement,'' says Laura Noble, an attorney who works with the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund and whose North Carolina-based firm had a 500 percent increase in calls about sexual harassment in the last three months of 2017.\n\n\"Some jury consultants will tell you that it’s negatively affecting harassment claimants because of this perception that the #MeToo movement’s gone too far,'' Noble said. \"So I think the next six,12,18 months, when these verdicts come back ... we’ll have a better sense of where the public really is, on whether there has been a social shift and mindset in how we deal with sexual harassment victims.’'\n\nHeadline-grabbing moments\n\nIt has been a year since dozens of allegations against Weinstein exposed the prevalence of sexual harassment in the workplace and sparked a wrenching conversation about abuse and assault in the nation's offices, factories and fields.\n\nSince then, the headline-grabbing moments have included the firings of media and Hollywood heavyweights like Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. In September, CBS CEO Moonves resigned in the wake of several accusations of sexual misconduct and legendary comedian Bill Cosby was sent to state prison after being convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.\n\nOne of the most fraught flash points of the #MeToo period occurred last week, when Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were teenagers.\n\n“We certainly have moved into a new era,'' says Tarana Burke, who created #MeToo more than a decade before it burst into the national consciousness and is considered the founder of the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"A moment doesn’t last for a year, and it doesn’t influence policy and pop culture,'' Burke continued. \"We will never not know about the depths of sexual violence, and we'll never not have language to talk about our experience with sexual violence, because of #MeToo.''\n\n#MeToo has reverberated in other ways. In January, Hollywood luminaries launched Time's Up, an organization whose Legal Defense Fund has raised more than $22 million to assist men and women who've been sexually harassed or violated on the job. As of last week, it had received 3,557 requests for assistance.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday that preliminary data showed sexual harassment complaints filed with it this fiscal year rose by more than 12 percent as compared to that same period in 2017. Additionally, sexual harassment claims were part of 41 lawsuits brought by the EEOC during this fiscal year, a more than 50 percent uptick in legal actions addressing that type of abuse as compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\nAnd lawmakers from New York to California have green lit legislation that includes measures to make anti-harassment training mandatory and bars employers from compelling staffers to sign waivers that block them from pursuing their harassers. Although a USA TODAY examination found that since #MeToo began, elected officials passed 261 laws that directly addressed topics championed by the movement, just a slight uptick from 238 in the year prior.\n\nBut there has also been an adverse reaction, with critics contending that the movement has painted a spectrum of behavior, from a lewd joke to outright assault, with the same punitive brush. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in February and March revealed that 51 percent of Americans believe the increased focus on sexual harassment and assault has made it more difficult for men to know how to interact with women at work.\n\nOthers say that women of color and low-wage workers who are most susceptible to sexual harassment have been relegated to the sidelines, their stories largely ignored by media fixated on victims and perpetrators who are affluent, famous and white.\n\nAs of Sept. 11, 28 percent of women and 9 percent of men said they have been sexually harassed at work, according to a study exclusively shared with USA TODAY by Comparably.com, a workplace culture and compensation monitoring site.\n\nIn the wake of #MeToo, high-profile companies have lost leaders. In December, celebrated chef and TV star Mario Batali stepped down from his company and TV show after multiple women accused him of groping and harassing them.\n\nSneaker giant Nike also has experienced changes among its executives. Nike brand president, Trevor Edwards, and Nike's vice president and general manager of global categories, Jayme Martin, resigned in March due to what company chairman and CEO Mark Parker said were “behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values.” News reports at the time said that Edwards and Martin had protected male employees accused of belittling women and foreign-born staffers.\n\nAs a growing number of businesses begin to examine their policies, some major companies and industries have drawn attention to their attempts to prevent sexual abuses and make it easier to fight back when they occur.\n\nIn December, Microsoft said it was getting rid of the arbitration clause in sexual harassment and gender discrimination cases for the fewer than 1 percent of its 125,000 employees who had such provisions in their employment agreements. That same month, Facebook made its anti-sexual-harassment policy public.\n\nAnd while the hotel industry had begun to take steps to combat harassment before the rise of #MeToo, in September, the American Hotel & Lodging Association and several major companies including Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt announced a pledge to ensure hotel workers throughout the U.S. have safety devices nearby to ward off sexual assault and other crimes by 2020.\n\n''Every industry should be looking at themselves and asking, ‘What more can we do?’ \" says Katherine Lugar, AHLA's president and CEO, noting that cultural expectations have changed, as has technology.\n\nBusinesses are in some ways moving at a faster clip than lawmakers, says Joan Fife, a labor and employment litigator and partner with the firm Winston & Strawn.\n\n\"I'm sure that many people would have expected there to be more prompt legislation passed and signed into law on both the state and the federal level,'' says Fife. “I think that companies have responded much more quickly. ... Going forward voluntarily, without waiting for the law to change, that's how best practices are created.''\n\nHowever, there has been a push on the legislative front as well. New York state approved legislation in March that requires all state contractors as of Jan. 1 to submit a declaration that they have a sexual harassment policy that adheres to at least minimum criteria and that they have trained all their staff members. All public and private employers must also have such a policy in place and give a copy of it along with yearly training to every worker as of Oct. 9.\n\nCalifornia has passed a handful of bills inspired or spurred by the #MeToo movement. They include legislation that says before an employer in the entertainment industry can receive a permit to hire a minor, underage performers between the ages of 14 and 17, and their parent, must undergo training in how to prevent sexual harassment and be told of where they can go to report such an offense. Another new law will require lobbyists to get training on the state's anti-harassment policies.\n\nBut much more needs to be done, advocates and survivors say. And some have voiced specific concerns that the movement has failed to adequately address the more layered challenges faced by working-class women, women of color and black women in particular.\n\n\"Most people who experience sexual harassment at work are not being harassed by somebody famous,'' says Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. \"I would say that the primary concern for all of us is what is the response available to those women and men who are experiencing harassment by someone who isn’t famous?... What resources and assistance are we providing to those individuals or those cases?\"\n\nBroader change needed\n\nMany advocates believe that rooting out harassment means also addressing broader issues of gender inequity in the workplace.\n\nOn Sunday, California's Gov. Jerry Brown signed a landmark bill that will require all publicly traded businesses with headquarters in the state to have at least one woman director on their boards by the end of next year. They will need to have at least two by the end of 2021.\n\nBut while a few other states have approved nonbinding resolutions with a similar goal of reaching gender diversity, California is the only state to address the issue with a specific law. And women in the workplace continue to lag behind from pay to promotions.\n\nWomen overall earn on average roughly 80 cents for every dollar brought home by a man, with black and Latina women even further behind. And there were 24 female CEOs among the Fortune 500 as of 2018, according to Fortune magazine, down from 32 last year, and the same number as in 2014.\n\nYet few Americans are confident that one battle will benefit the other.\n\nPew Research found that 28 percent of Americans believed more attention on sexual harassment and assault would eventually increase professional opportunities for women, while 51 percent said it wouldn't do much either way and 20 percent said it would actually hurt their chances.\n\nAnd Burke says that with so much work to be done to address sexual violence, from workplace harassment to child abuse, advocates must be careful not to push too many issues under the #MeToo umbrella.\n\n\"There's definitely a line that can be drawn but i also think that we have for the first time in our history . . .. the opportunity to have a continuous conversation around sexual violence, \"she says. \"We cannot dilute that conversation ... because this is also not a woman’s movement. MeToo is about sexual violence and surviving sexual violence whether (survivors) identify as women, or men, or transgender or don't identify with a gender at all.''\n\nThe fact that men can be victimized as well was brought into focus when Asia Argento, a vocal MeToo activist was accused of committing statutory rape against former child actor Jimmy Bennett, when he was 17 and she was 37 in 2013. (Argento has given conflicting responses, previously denying that she'd had sex with Bennett, reportedly saying in private texts that she had, and most recently saying through her attorney that Bennett attacked her.)\n\nIn regard to whether such an allegation against such a prominent MeToo activist hurts the movement, Martin of the National Women’s Law Center says that \"it is good that all different sorts of survivors are feeling empowered to share their experience and ... while it can be difficult, it is for the best for the movement to recognize complexity; that there aren’t perfect survivors, that being a perfect victim shouldn’t be a prerequisite for getting some sort of justice and people who are victimized can victimize others.''\n\nThe vigorous debate currently raging across the country about Kavanaugh's pending Supreme Court nomination has also fed concerns that there is often an unfair rush to judgement of those accused of sexual abuses.\n\nAccording to Pew, though 50 percent of Americans believe men going unpunished for harassing and sexually aggressive behavior on the job is a significant problem – and 46 percent think women who make such accusations not being believed is a major issue – 34 percent think the accused being fired prematurely is a significant concern. Slightly more than 3 in 10 also see false accusations as being very problematic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, addressing questions from reporters Tuesday about the Kavanaugh nomination, said, \"it's a very scary time for young men in America.”\n\nBut advocates say that for too long, the accused have gotten a much greater benefit of the doubt than their alleged victims.\n\n“We are a country of laws, and I think we will always give people their day in court,'' says Nina Shaw, an attorney and Time's Up founding member. \"But we’re coming from a system where for centuries the voices of the victimized and abused were never heard. ... It’s so ironic when I hear people say we are we moving too fast.''\n\nThe next chapter\n\nAs the movement enters its next chapter, activists say more attention needs to be paid to expanding reforms and implementing creative solutions.\n\nFor instance, independent contractors, unpaid volunteers and smaller businesses \"may fall outside the protection of sexual harassment law,'' Martin says. \"That needs to change.''\n\nSome legislatures have also proposed requiring public companies to report to shareholders the number of sexual harassment settlements they've made in the previous 12 months and how much they paid. By providing benchmarks and insights into whether there's a pattern or sudden surge in complaints, Martin says, \"it helps peel back the layer of secrecy that can allow harassment to flourish year after year.''\n\nAnd more resources must be devoted to helping survivors, from psychological counseling to legal assistance.\n\nThose encouraged to share their #MeToo experiences, Burke says, are \"going to crisis hotlines, into churches, and those programs need resources.''\n\nBut however many roadblocks remain, advocates say, transformation remains possible. \"I pray for a time when I'm telling these stories to my granddaughter and she's rolling her eyes ... because I'm talking about something that is so absolutely foreign to her that she can't imagine it,'' Shaw says. \"That time only comes if we continue to put our shoulder in the struggle.''\n\nContributing: Jorge Ortiz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/02/ollie-camel-cactus-juice-walls-can-crown-news-around-states/111388938/", "title": "Ollie the camel, cactus-juice walls: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Fifty-five years after the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, the third and final interpretive center along the 54-mile route is finally set to open on the Alabama State University campus. ASU President Quinton Ross announced the grand opening will be held March 25, the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. leading tens of thousands of marchers to the steps of the Alabama State Capitol at the conclusion of the five-day march in 1965. Ahead of the official opening – a day more than a decade in the making – the center opened for a sneak peek to the community Saturday and Sunday. The National Park Service selected ASU as the site for the third center in 2008 and began construction in 2014. While the other two centers, in Selma and White Hall, have been opened, setbacks including a federal government shutdown have continued to stall the Montgomery project until now.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: While many locals escape harsh winter temperatures in February, Matthew Santiago embraced them. Matthew, 8, of Orlando, Florida, is a cancer survivor who expressed a desire to the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make a snowman in Alaska. His dream was fulfilled last week at the Fairbanks Ice Art Park, television station KTVF reports. Matthew has battled Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, with chemotherapy, multiple surgeries, stem cell transplants, radiation treatment and months of immunotherapy. The ice art park features ice sculptures and activities for children such as ice slides. Park officials offered Matthew more than a tour. They let him help harvest a thick block of ice from a pond. Matthew was lifted into a telescopic forklift. With assistance from a heavy equipment operator, he jerked the machine forward and lifted a massive cube of ice for sculpting.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Mission San Xavier is set to undergo its biggest preservation project in more than a decade. The Arizona Daily Star reports scaffolding could go up by late fall around the iconic church’s east tower. Workers will spend the next two years carefully removing and replacing problematic plaster around the structure’s centuries-old brick walls. Patronato San Xavier has overseen preservation and fundraising for Arizona’s oldest intact European structure since 1978. During the 1940s and 1950s, the mission’s well-meaning stewards covered the building with concrete plaster made from Portland cement. But decades later, caretakers discovered that moisture trapped by the concrete plaster was being drawn by gravity down through the building, damaging the walls and interior. The old stuff will be replaced with new coats of traditional lime-washed plaster mixed with cactus juice, which allows the walls to breathe and release moisture.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a state law to expand the procedures optometrists may perform filed a new lawsuit Friday to prevent an effort to repeal the measure from appearing on the ballot this fall. The group, Arkansans for Healthy Eyes, asked the state Supreme Court to disqualify the referendum on the eye surgery law from the November ballot. The law approved by the Legislature last year would allow optometrists to perform several procedures that previously only ophthalmologists could, including injections around the eye, removing lesions from the eyelids and certain laser eye surgeries. The lawsuit contends that signature-gatherers gave out misleading information about the law. It also challenges the wording of the referendum and the validity of thousands of signatures submitted. A Pulaski County judge last month dismissed another lawsuit by Arkansans for Healthy Eyes aimed at blocking the referendum effort.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A baby hippopotamus born at the San Diego Zoo last month has a name. The zoo says the river hippo calf will be called Amahle, which means “beautiful one” in Zulu. The name was announced Friday on “Good Morning America,” which held an online poll asking viewers to choose among three African names. Amahle, born Feb. 8, weighs about 100 pounds and is “active and healthy,” a zoo statement said. Amahle is the ninth hippo calf born at the zoo and the 13th to her mother, Funani. Amahle’s father, Otis, is an East African hippo who arrived at the zoo in 2009 specifically to breed with Funani, zoo officials said. Zoo visitors can see Amahle and her mother in the hippo habitat on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An elected prosecutor for the state’s northeastern rural plains surrendered to authorities Friday, one day after being indicted on drug charges following an investigation by the state’s attorney general. Brittny Lewton, 40, was charged with three drug felonies, including conspiracy and possession, as well as official misconduct, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. She turned herself in to authorities in Logan County, one of seven counties in the 13th Judicial District where she serves as the district attorney. Online court records did not specify the type of drug or drugs in the indictment, which has not been made public. Lewton’s attorney, Stan Garnett, said the charges appear to be based on one incident in July 2019 involving an alleged exchange of prescription medication. Garnett, a former district attorney in Boulder County, said he could not elaborate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An expert on torture with the United Nations is calling out the use of solitary confinement as punishment in the state’s prisons, saying it could amount to psychological torture. Nils Melzer, special rapporteur on torture for the U.N., criticized on Friday the use of solitary confinement in the United States but specifically mentioned Connecticut’s Department of Correction’s practices. “The DOC appears to routinely resort to repressive measures, such as prolonged or indefinite isolation, excessive use of in-cell restraints and needlessly intrusive strip searches,” Melzer said in a statement. “There seems to be a State-sanctioned policy aimed at purposefully inflicting severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, which may well amount to torture.” He said the alleged practices can trigger and exacerbate psychological suffering, especially for those who may have experienced previous trauma or have mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A 12-year-old boy was arrested Thursday after he ordered Chinese food, then stole the delivery driver’s car, New Castle County Police said. Officers were dispatched to the Paladin Club Apartments for a vehicle theft, police said. When they arrived, they spotted the vehicle driving through the complex. The officers turned on their emergency lights, and the vehicle began to slow down. Before the vehicle stopped, the boy got out and ran, police said, and the driverless vehicle then drifted into a marked patrol car. Police caught the boy in a neighboring apartment complex. No injuries were reported, and both vehicles sustained minor damage. The boy was arrested and charged with vehicle theft, resisting arrest, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident, an official said. He was arraigned and released to his parent on $1,450 unsecured bail, an official said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital will soon have two statues on display in the nation’s Capitol, just like the 50 states, after a concerted effort lasting more than 10 years, WUSA-TV reports. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Wednesday that she will accept a second statue to be displayed on the House of Representatives’ side of the Capitol. Pierre L’Enfant, the architect of D.C.’s layout and the National Mall, will be memorialized among the Capitol’s statue collection. In 2013, D.C. got to display its first statue in the Capitol. Famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ likeness sits in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. The L’Enfant statue is currently on display in the lobby of 1 Judiciary Square, a D.C. government building. It will be the sixth statue listed under “other statues” that are on display at the Capitol. Neither L’Enfant’s or Douglass’ statue will be considered part of the official National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: Spring breakers be forewarned: You still can’t drink booze in March on the beach in this town seeking to curb rowdy parties. The Panama City News Herald reports that the monthlong ban is paired with a 2 a.m. deadline to buy alcohol anywhere within city limits. Panama City Police Chief Drew Whitman says a zero-tolerance policy originally enacted in 2015 has helped the city transition from a national spring break hot spot to a more family-friendly destination all year long. Whitman says enforcing the ban includes extra officers on the beach, some on all-terrain vehicles. Violators can be fined or even jailed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state Supreme Court justice announced Friday that he plans to resign in November, citing family obligations. Justice Keith Blackwell, 44, said in a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp that he has decided to return to private law practice, according to a statement from the court. “Our oldest daughter will leave for college in only a couple of years, and her sisters will follow not long behind,” Blackwell wrote. “I have decided that it is best for my family that I return to the private practice of law.” Blackwell was appointed to the high court in 2012 by then-Gov. Nathan Deal after having served for two years on the state Court of Appeals. His last day on the Supreme Court will be Nov. 18, and Kemp will appoint his replacement. Justice Robert Benham announced earlier this year that he would retire March 1. The process to find his replacement, also to be appointed by Kemp, is underway.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The speaker of the state’s House of Representatives said Friday that he wants to form a committee to examine the potential economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak so lawmakers can be prepared to cut spending if tax revenue drops sharply. Scott Saiki recalled the state had to slash $2.1 billion in spending from state budgets over a three-year period when tax revenue sank during the recession a decade ago. That led to furloughs for government employees, a four-day week for public school students, and dramatic cuts to mental health and other services. The speaker said he wasn’t proposing to cut spending and build up financial reserves but wanted to assess the economic effect of the outbreak before taking such steps. But such cuts are a possibility, he said. Saiki said House members would vote Tuesday on a resolution that would create a select committee including government officials, industry leaders and union members.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would ban any public money from going to organizations that provide abortions was approved Friday by a panel of state lawmakers despite opposition on both sides of the abortion debate, including some who complained that it still allowed exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest. The House State Affairs Committee sent the legislation to the full House with a “do pass” recommendation. Federal and state law already ban public funding for abortion except in certain circumstances. But health care providers who perform abortions can receive public funding for other medical services. The bill aims to prevent any public funding from going to health care providers if they perform abortions except for in certain situations. Those exceptions are narrower than the ones already set by state law, and the Idaho attorney general’s office has warned lawmakers that the legislation would likely draw lawsuits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A spike in crime on the city’s rail system and some recent high-profile outbursts of violence have prompted the police department to put 50 more officers in trains and on platforms and assign four detectives to investigate nothing but Chicago Transit Authority crimes, officials announced Friday. Hours after the new security plan was unveiled, Chicago police said an officer shot a man on the platform of a CTA station in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. Officers confronted the man after he was observed moving from car to car of a moving train, a city ordinance violation, said Deputy Superintendent Barbara West. The wounded man was taken to a hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition after surgery, West said. Days before the announcement by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck, riders began seeing more police SWAT officers boarding trains and manning platforms on the nation’s second-largest public transit system.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: One of the state’s largest school districts canceled bus service Friday after too many drivers called in sick in an apparent labor dispute, and parents were warned over the weekend to find “alternative ways” to get their kids to school Monday morning. Indianapolis Public Schools said schools remained open, but students unable to get to them because of no buses would not be marked absent. The city’s public schools will open Monday, regardless of whether bus service is restored for all of its students, the district said Saturday evening. Superintendent Aleesia Johnson and other district leaders were meeting with representatives for the bus drivers’ union to resolve the situation, district spokeswoman Carrie Cline Black said. IPS announced Jan. 30 that it would not renew a contract with bus vendor Durham School Services that expires June 30 in a cost-cutting move.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Warren County supervisors have approved construction of a long-sought justice center in the city. The board on Thursday backed a trimmed-down plan for the $30 million-plus project. Construction is expected to begin this summer with a goal of completion in the next 18 to 19 months. The new plan retains the four courtrooms and 88-bed jail. Voters had approved $29.9 million for the project in 2018, but the bids came in more than $7 million higher. A referendum to let the county borrow an additional $3.5 million for the project gained support from nearly 56% of the voters, but the referendum required approval from 60%. The state had ordered the county to close the jail. Among its problems: failing a state fire marshal’s inspection, inadequate water supplies, inmate escapes, mold, cleanliness. The jail was on the third floor of the Indianola courthouse, which has since been torn down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A foul-mouthed judge who cursed at courthouse employees so often that a trial clerk kept a “swear journal” documenting his outbursts should be publicly censured and receive professional coaching but not kicked off the bench, a disciplinary panel recommended Friday. The Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct unanimously concluded that Montgomery County Judge F. William Cullins violated central judicial canons of independence, integrity and impartiality. Its recommendations will be sent to the Kansas Supreme Court, which will ultimately decide his fate. An admonishment or a “cease and desist” order was not sufficient discipline, the panel concluded. His attorney, Chris Joseph, had argued during disciplinary proceedings that his speech is protected by the First Amendment and does not diminish his integrity. But Cullins’ use of foul, derogatory words directed at women manifested a clear bias based on sex, the panel found.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: More than 150 members of the local Cuban community snaked through the city Saturday in a caravan of U.S. and Cuban flag-draped cars, calling for an end to Cuba’s socialist government. With horns blaring and Cuban music blasting, the rally came in the wake of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ praise for Cuba’s high literacy rate. Critics said it lacked context, partly because Cubans aren’t free to read and write what they want. At the rally Saturday, signs read “No Socialism in America,” “Cuba Libra” and “Make Cuba Great Again,” mixed in with signs supporting President Donald Trump. Others said they were Democrats, reflecting the Cuban community’s political diversity. The attendees gathered outside a Cuban market, giving fiery speeches denouncing the Cuban government, before driving through the city to a parking lot near Louisville Slugger Field downtown, where they they sang the old Cuban national anthem.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three state historic sites are open for additional days to visitors starting this month, the Office of State Parks announced. The Audubon State Historic Site in St. Francisville, Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site in St. Martinville and Port Hudson State Historic Site near Baton Rouge will operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week. The expanded visiting hours start Monday. “This goes a long way in fulfilling our mission to provide the best possible experience of all of Louisiana’s treasure to both our residents and our visitors,” Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees the state parks and historic sites, said in a statement. The three facilities join Poverty Point World Heritage Site and Rosedown Plantation State Historic Site in operating seven days a week.\n\nMaine\n\nFort Kent: Thirteen mushers have launched their annual dash across the wilderness of northern Maine. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent with mushers from Maine, Minnesota, Iowa and several Canadian provinces. The grueling course takes mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent by Monday morning. Each race is different. The temperature plummeted to minus-38 during the first Can-Am Crown and then soared to 61 degrees a year later. But the weather is cooperating this year. A winter storm on Thursday left a fresh layer of 10 inches of snow on the course, and temperatures were dipping to single digits at night, ideal conditions for the dogs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A $3.2 million study that was supposed to evaluate the city’s risk of storm flooding was suspended after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to secure federal funding. The agency’s Baltimore division announced Tuesday that work would be halted on the risk management study. It would have, in part, assessed the vulnerability of Baltimore’s port terminals, highways, evacuation routes, hospitals, public utilities and local airport facilities in the case of severe storms, the Corps said. The Baltimore region was identified as a focus area due its high susceptibility to flooding outlined in a 2015 report in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the agency. The Corps said it will request the funding again during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New England Aquarium officials have expressed opposition to a proposed 600-foot skyscraper that would be built in place of the Boston Harbor Garage. A crowd gathered Thursday at the first public meeting to discuss concerns for Don Chiofaro’s proposed $1.2 billion, 42-story skyscraper, the Boston Herald reports. The proposed tower, called “The Pinnacle,” would have two floors for retail and dining, 22 floors of office space, and 200 apartments on the top 18 floors, according to plans filed with the Boston Planning & Development Agency. “The New England Aquarium stands in staunch opposition to this proposed development,” said Vikki Spruill, the president and CEO of the New England Aquarium. “Climate change is at the heart of our concerns about this development. … This is about the future of our downtown waterfront.” The aquarium is located on Central Wharf behind the garage.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The outlook on the city’s debt has been upgraded from “stable” to “positive” by Moody’s Investors Service. The adjustment means the city’s finances are pointing in a positive direction, and there is a higher chance the city will be upgraded in the next year or two, Moody’s said in a news release. The rating and new outlook apply to $135 million of general obligation debt. Moody’s affirmed the city’s Ba3 bond rating and added that the rating remains three notches below investment grade. Moody’s said the revised outlook reflects the city budget’s ability to finance service improvements and capital investments and to accommodate an increase in pension contributions. The city emerged from bankruptcy in December 2014, having restructured or wiped out $7 billion in debt.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Janitors who work at Twin Cities commercial buildings are striking as part of a push for higher wages and better benefits in their contracts. The Star Tribune reports more than 100 janitors walked off the job Thursday and rallied along Nicollet Mall, waving signs and beating drums outside the skyscrapers they clean each day. They were joined by a separate group of youth climate strikers who marched in solidarity. The Service Employees International Union, which represents 4,000 janitors who clean Twin Cities commercial buildings, organized the daylong strike before a bargaining session Friday. Members have also been pushing for paid sick days and a program to expand the use of nontoxic cleaning chemicals, among other things.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Authorities on Saturday released the identity of one of two inmates who died earlier in the week at a penitentiary that is under U.S. Justice Department investigation. The Mississippi Department of Corrections said Timothy R. Sharpe, who was serving a 20-year-sentence for sexual battery and child molestation, died Friday at the prison hospital at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. He was 61. The statement said the name of another inmate who died Thursday at Parchman’s prison hospital hasn’t been released pending notification of relatives. The statement didn’t give any details about the deaths. In a news release Friday, Sunflower County Coroner Heather Burton said there was “no evidence of foul play” in either death. Autopsies were planned in both cases. With those included, at least 21 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Democrats in the state House want to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but their proposals have yet to be assigned to a committee for a hearing. The sponsor of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act, state Rep. Greg Razer of Kansas City, told St. Louis Public Radio he’s frustrated about the lack of progress. State law already bans discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex and disability. Past proposals to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have fallen flat in the Legislature. Opponents say they believe businesses should be able to create their own policies. Democrats are also concerned about a proposed constitutional amendment that would require all public school athletes to compete against students of their biological rather than chosen sex. Opponents fear it would unfairly exclude transgender students or put them at risk of harassment.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: For the first time in a decade, schools in the state are using fewer emergency authorizations than the year before as small, rural schools continue to struggle finding teachers. The state’s “last resort” option effectively allows teachers to work in a school for a year despite not being qualified to do so under state law. Its numbers have mushroomed in recent years as the state encouraged schools to use the option instead of taking an accreditation ding. In 2019-2020, it dropped to 84 compared to 94 last school year. Montana’s small rural schools have long struggled to attract and keep qualified teachers, but the shortage has reached “crisis” levels in recent years, according to experts. The decrease is far from a sign that the issue is solved, and it’s still the second highest figure in recent years.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Selling the natural gas generated at one of the city’s wastewater treatment plants will produce $2 million of new revenue annually, the mayor said. The sales also will further the city goal of environmental sustainability, Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird said Thursday. Lincoln has used the gas to produce electricity that helped power the wastewater treatment plant. City officials decided in 2017, however, that upgrading the system at the Theresa Street plant and selling the biogas locally or nationally would provide a greater return on investment. The $8 million upgrade will be complete this summer, and city officials plan to begin sales under an agreement with a Utah-based energy management company, Blue Source. The Blue Source contract is set for public hearing and a council vote Monday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos continued a hot streak in January, topping $1 billion in house winnings for the second consecutive month and eighth time in the past year. The state Gaming Control Board on Friday reported the statewide “casino win” figure was slightly lower than in December but was up almost 5.5% compared with the same month in 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton said casinos reported increases in all categories, including table games, blackjack, roulette, sports betting, slot machines and baccarat. Baccarat winnings sometimes jump or drop significantly in a month. They were up 17% in January, totaling more than $112 million. Lawton noted the game is a favorite of Asian tourists, and the Chinese Lunar New Year fell in January this year. The holiday was in February last year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials will use federal funds to examine the effects of rising seas on major highways and connecting routes along the coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is funding a “vulnerability assessment” for the I-95, Route 1 and Route 1A corridors and local connector roads, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Researchers will combine traffic models and climate change projections to determine what areas have a higher risk of flooding from rising sea levels. A 2015 report by the Rockingham Planning Commission found that a 1.7-foot rise in sea levels would flood 5 miles of New Hampshire coastal roads. A 4-foot rise would flood more than 23 miles of roads. A state report released last year estimated that a 1-to-3-foot rise is “likely” by 2100 under most scenarios and that there is a 1-in-20 chance that a 4-foot rise could happen by the turn of the next century.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: A dozen sea turtles that nearly froze when they were too far north last fall as water temperatures abruptly plunged off the state’s coast survived that ordeal but remain threatened by the pneumonia most of them developed afterward. Sea Turtle Recovery, a nonprofit group operating out of the Turtle Back Zoo in northern New Jersey, got the turtles through their initial medical crisis, with two needing CPR. But 11 of them went on to develop pneumonia, a common problem in turtles that survive so-called cold-stunning and one that could yet kill some of them. The turtles are being treated with medications, and their progress and conditions are checked daily in a hospital on the grounds of the turtle-themed zoo that is popular with children. Ten of the 12 are green turtles, along with one loggerhead and one endangered Kemp’s Ridley turtle.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. land managers on Friday made public a list of possible alternatives for managing development in one of the nation’s oldest oil and gas basins, but environmentalists and others say the options fail to take into account the cumulative costs of increased drilling and threats to Native American cultural sites in northwestern New Mexico. Officials with the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs indicated their preference for an alternative that would “balance community needs and development” while limiting impacts on the traditional, socioeconomic and cultural way of life of those who call the area home. The alternative emphasizes local and tribal perspectives and includes a range of options for limiting development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, the officials said. The World Heritage site has become the focal point in a decades­long fight over oil and gas.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: People threw punches and were dragged to the ground Saturday as a long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation flared up for a second time in a week. The altercation followed a news conference by a group of chiefs who oppose the authority of Clint Halftown, the federally recognized leader of the roughly 500-member western New York tribe. Halftown on Feb. 22 sent bulldozers to demolish a convenience store and other buildings controlled by tribe members who oppose him. The seven chiefs called a news conference Saturday adjacent to a disputed property to address the incident and brought supporters from other American Indian nations that make up the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. A group that crossed the caution tape and walked onto the property after the news conference was immediately confronted by a large group wearing Cayuga Nation Police jackets, and fighting broke out, according to The Citizen of Auburn.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The shuffling of Gov. Roy Cooper’s original Cabinet became official Friday with changes at the transportation and information technology departments. Eric Boyette, the new Department of Transportation secretary, and Tracy Doaks, secretary of the information technology department, were sworn in to their posts by Court of Appeals Judge Reuben Young in a private ceremony, Cooper’s office said. Doaks, most recently the chief deputy state chief information officer, suceeded Boyette as secretary at the state IT office. At DOT, Boyette succeeded Jim Trogdon, who retired from state government. Boyette previously worked in DOT as inspector general and the Division of Motor Vehicles commissioner before going over to information technology in 2015. Cooper announced the changes last month. The other eight members of Cooper’s Cabinet from 2017 are still in their original jobs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man shot and killed by police last month did not fire at officers as authorities initially reported, though he did point a handgun at them, justifying the use of deadly force. The Bismarck Tribune reports an investigation found Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck, also had a handful of encounters with police in the two weeks leading up to his death that were tied to alleged drug use, mental health issues and threats against law enforcement. Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer on Monday said the shooting of Carnes was justifiable. Authorities said Carnes pointed a gun at officers outside his window after police were called to a noise complaint at his residence Jan. 9. A report that Lawyer sent to Bismarck Police Chief Dave Draovitch stated that one of the two firing officers “believed he saw and heard Carnes fire a round from the handgun and returned fire,” but the other officer “stated he did not believe that Carnes had fired the handgun.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A proposed constitutional amendment that would set 16-year term limits on legislators serving in the state House or Senate has cleared its initial hurdle. Ohioans for Legislative Term Limits is the group seeking to close a loophole that’s allowed multiple legislators to jump back and forth between the House and Senate after reaching the current eight-year limit in one or the other chamber. The group’s goal is to place the amendment on the Nov. 3 ballot. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s office certified the campaign’s first 1,000 signatures Thursday and also certified that the summary petition language is “fair and truthful.” The issue goes next to the state Ballot Board, which must determine whether it contains a single issue or multiple issues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: Dozens of students at the University of Oklahoma have ended a sit-in outside the school’s administrative offices following two instances in which professors used racial slurs in their classrooms. The three-day sit-in organized by the Black Emergency Response Team ended Friday with the student group saying progress had been made. OU Dean of Students David Surratt said in a statement Friday that the students “raised legitimate concerns,” and their demands “were actually solutions” the university has included in a strategic plan to be presented to OU regents. One idea was the creation of a student advisory committee. BERT co-director Miles Francisco told The Oklahoman that the student advisory committee will provide “insights and advice to the office of the senior president and provost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A federal judge said he wouldn’t block new city housing screening and security deposit rules that took effect over the weekend because a rental industry group waited too long to file a legal challenge. U.S. District Judge Michael Simon on Thursday said he was denying a request from Multifamily NW for a temporary restraining order to delay two Fair Access in Renting ordinances. He said it was because the almost yearlong gap between when the City Council approved them and when the group sued Feb. 21 “implies a lack of urgency or a lack of irreparable harm,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Multifamily NW and two landlords sued the city, claiming the new rules were unconstitutional and ultimately should never go into effect. Simon said he didn’t believe U.S. District Court was the appropriate venue to sort out the constitutionality of city policies.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man stole an ambulance and tried to run over an officer who shot him three times, leading to a low-speed chase through the city that lasted more than an hour Friday night, authorities said. Authorities were called to a motel in northeast Philadelphia about 9:20 p.m. for reports of a domestic disturbance involving a man and a woman that necessitated medical attention for one or more parties, Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew of Philadelphia police said. The man became combative and jumped into the ambulance, driving at one of the officers who medics called for backup, Kinebrew said. The officer fired his weapon four times, striking the man three times: twice in the left leg and once in the side. The officer was struck by the ambulance and hospitalized with injuries that Kinebrew described as non-life-threatening.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Former British Prime Minister Theresa May is speaking at Brown University this week. May is giving an address about global affairs at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday at the university’s campus in Providence. University President Christina Paxson will lead a discussion on the successes, challenges and inspirations behind May’s decades­long government career. The event is free and open to the public, but attendees must register in advance, and tickets are limited. May served as prime minister for three years. In her final months, Parliament repeatedly rejected the Brexit divorce deal with the European Union that was the cornerstone of her administration. She finally accepted that her Conservative Party was hopelessly divided on the issue and succumbed to pressure to step down. May’s address is titled “Politics, Populism and Polarization: Perspectives on the Global Economy.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTravelers Rest: Investigators shut down an entire state park Saturday as they searched for a man wanted for murder, but they didn’t find the suspect. Greenville County deputies found an SUV they think was driven by Ryan Kedar just outside Paris Mountain State Park and decided to close the park, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Ryan Flood said. About 100 officers searched all day Saturday at the park north of Greenville but did not find Kedar or anything else except for the SUV tying him to the park, Flood said in a statement. Kedar allegedly shot and killed 58-year-old Mark Jermon at a park in Taylors on Wednesday, authorities said. The men knew each other, but deputies aren’t sure what led to the shooting, Flood said. Kedar, 49, is an avid camper and hiker at state and national parks, Flood said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: A motorcycle club is opposing a move by the city to annex some of the club’s property on the western edge of town. Jackpine Gypsies Motorcycle Club President Brett Winsell said the annexation goes beyond the potential for higher property taxes. He said the club is more concerned with current and future city ordinances concerning noise, signage and other issues that may prevent the club from staging its races and other events on the grounds. The Jackpine Gypsies and founder J.C. Pappy Hoel began the Sturgis motorcycle rally in 1938 and have hosted motorcycle races, hill climbs, motocross and other events. City Manager Daniel Ainslie said the Jackpine Gypsies property and other parcels under consideration for annexation benefit from city services and should pay for them. The Rapid City Journal reports a public hearing is scheduled Monday, followed by a council vote on the intent to annex.\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: More than three months before the start of the 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, the event is already sold out in record time. That includes all general admission passes and VIP packages, plus the new mid-tier “GA+” tickets. Bonnaroo says this is the quickest sellout in the festival’s 19-year history. For comparison’s sake, last year’s event was also a rare sellout, but that didn’t happen until the day before the music began. It also continues an impressive commercial rebound for the fest. Last year marked Bonnaroo’s first sellout since 2013 and came three years after a dismal 2016, when ticket sales hit an all-time low of roughly 46,000 in 2016. The 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival takes place June 11-14 at Great Stage Park in Manchester. Lizzo, Tool and Tame Impala headline, alongside Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, Vampire Weekend, Bassnectar, The 1975 and Flume, among 100-plus acts.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: State health officials say people who visited the cattle barn at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo may need to be assessed for possible rabies exposure because a cow there had the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Saturday that people who visited the barn Feb. 11-14 may need to be assessed. Health officials say they’ve been in contact with the people who were caring for the cow and the animals in nearby stalls. The cow was being shown by a student. Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals. It can be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms begin; however, once symptoms start, it’s almost always fatal, health officials said. If someone is exposed, it usually takes between three weeks and three months for them to get sick.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Polygamy wouldn’t be a felony crime in the state for the first time in 85 years under a bill that passed the Legislature on Friday and appears to be supported by the governor. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly for the proposal that supporters said will allow the 30,000 or so people living in the state’s polygamous communities to come out of the shadows and report abuses such as underage marriage by other polygamists without fear of prosecution. “It seems so surreal; you’re so used to it not being this way,” said Joe Darger, a Utah polygamist who has three wives. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has indicated he will likely sign the proposal that makes polygamy between consenting adults an infraction, like a traffic offense, that carries no possible jail time. “This one has overwhelming support, though it’s not without some controversy,” Herbert said during his monthly news conference at PBS Utah on Thursday.\n\nVermont\n\nFerrisburgh: Oliver the camel, a quirky roadside attraction and social media darling, has died at age 17 in Vermont. “Ollie” delighted travelers along Route 7 in Ferrisburgh for nearly two decades. Many motorists stopped for photos and selfies with the friendly creature, which sported two humps. Oliver Camel’s Facebook page anounced Friday that he died Feb. 21. It did not cite the cause of his death. The Facebook post noted that “Ollie” was loved and spoiled and looking forward to an afterlife. “My next adventure is ahead and I am ready to take it on – to go where no camel has gone before!!” the post said. Ollie lived on a sheep farm. He was a Bactrian camel that’s native to Asia, so the cold weather didn’t bother him. His owner didn’t immediately return a message Saturday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Officials from southwest Virginia have mounted a last-minute push to oppose the possible early closure of one of the country’s newest coal plants. A Dominion Energy facility in Wise County that opened eight years ago and is frequently touted as the cleanest of its type could close decades sooner than expected under a sweeping rewrite of the state’s energy generation policy that Democrats are advancing through the General Assembly. Advocates of the bill say Virginia needs to move away from fossil fuel-fired generation in order to address climate change. But Republican lawmakers and local officials in southwest Virginia have called its potential early retirement a “tragedy” that would blow a hole in the budgets of two localities and devastate a region that’s been working to revitalize an economy built on coal mining but isn’t there yet.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man who recently served prison time on a gun charge amassed an arsenal of homemade “ghost guns” after his release even though he was on federal supervision, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court. Nathan Brasfield, 40, of Edmonds, was sentenced to four years in prison after a 2014 arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm. He began a three-year term of supervised release in October 2017. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle said in a federal complaint unsealed Thursday that when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched his home and vehicle Feb. 6, they found dozens of guns as well as several machines used in home manufacturing of firearms: a 3-D printer, drill press and computer numerical control machine – also known as a “ghost gunner.” Agents reported finding 17 pistols, 24 rifles and 10 silencers, with most of the guns being homemade and having no serial numbers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state may soon stiffen fines for restaurants that fail to secure the lids of grease pits after a young girl fell into one of the collection traps last year. The House of Delegates on Friday unanimously approved a measure to increase fines from $5 to $50 per day for businesses that don’t secure the grease pit lids. The proposal, which was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier this month, now goes back to that chamber with some minor amendments. The bill followed an incident last November in which 5-year-old Kambria Cvechko stepped on one of the lids outside a Charleston restaurant and fell into the pit’s narrow opening, submerging into the dark, putrid grease. Her panicked mother scurried down the hole headfirst as two other children anchored her feet, clawing through the slick liquid for her daughter’s arms as she could hear the girl gasping for air. Eventually, Kambria was lifted out of the pit without any major injuries.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Gov. Tony Evers vetoed Republican lawmakers’ tough-on-crime legislation Friday. The vetoes were hardly a surprise, as the governor campaigned on cutting the state’s prison population in half. The bills would have required the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person’s extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; expanded the list the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be an adult felony; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and blocked violent criminals from participating in early release programs. Evers said in his veto messages that the revocation recommendation bill would have cost the state $200 million in just the first two years. The DOC has projected the bill would force the agency to build two new prisons to handle the influx of new inmates.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A measure to impose a 5% statewide lodging tax appears likely to pass the Legislature after the state Senate approved it. The Senate, which defeated a similar bill last year, passed the lodging tax measure Friday by a 16-13 vote. The measure had previously passed the House. A committee must negotiate differences in the versions that each chamber approved before the bill advances to the governor. Gov. Mark Gordon has previously endorsed the bill, saying a lodging tax is the only new tax he would support. Wyoming is seeking ways to shore up its budget amid declining energy production revenue, but the Republican-dominated Legislature is reluctant to support tax increases. Other tax bills have been defeated in the legislative session or failed to generate enough support to be introduced.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/20/lego-impeachment-emotional-support-coyote-mumbo-sauce-news-around-states/40858653/", "title": "Lego impeachment, emotional support coyote: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A state trust is purchasing a nearly 500-acre tract in north Alabama for $10 million to protect the habitat of a tiny fish that had endangered work on a $1.6 billion car plant. The Forever Wild Land Trust bought land where the rare spring pygmy sunfish lives near the Mazda Toyota plant being built in Limestone County, news outlets report. The fish, listed as a federally threatened species, is known to exist in only two locations in the state, including the Beaverdam Spring area near the factory. The Center for Biological Diversity and Tennessee Riverkeeper had threatened to sue to protect the sunfish and its habitat before reaching a deal to protect the fish a year ago. The land purchase was part of that agreement. The car factory is projected to begin production in 2021 with as many as 4,000 employees.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The National Park Service plans to limit the opening of the Denali National Park road in 2020 due to the severe collapse of a hillside, officials say. The park’s 92-mile road is expected to open only to mile 43 just before Polychrome Pass at the start of the summer season, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. A steep, increasingly unstable section of road called Pretty Rocks consists of clay-rich soil on top of several feet of frozen ground. As temperatures rise and precipitation increases, the road portion has started moving downhill, officials say. “The last six years have been some of the warmest we’ve seen,” park geologist Denny Capps said in a statement. Travel will be prevented to popular sites including Polychrome Overlook, Toklat River Rest Stop, Stony Hill Overlook, Eielson Visitor Center and Wonder Lake areas, officials say.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Uber and Lyft say they are prepared to leave Sky Harbor International Airport after the City Council voted 7 to 2 on Wednesday to approve an increase in ride-share fees for dropping off and picking up passengers, though neither company will say when. The new fee of $4 per trip will go into effect Feb. 1. The fee will increase by 25 cents each year, reaching $5 each way in 2024. “The city of Phoenix will be driving out ride sharing from our airport. This is what is going to happen today,” said Councilman Sal DiCiccio, who opposed the proposal. He and Councilman Jim Warring were the two “no” votes on the measure. Councilman Carlos Garcia, who voted in favor, countered that “for a long time we have been subsidizing these corporations.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A historic Dallas home connected to the criminal exploits of Clyde Barrow and the Jan. 6, 1933, shooting death of Deputy Sheriff Malcom Davis is up for demolition. But Jeff Hill has a plan to salvage the front of the house and bring it to Fort Smith. He just needs a carpenter with some tools and a few extra partners to help pay about $11,000 to haul it from Dallas. Hill, a local history enthusiast who has helped track down several Fort Smith connections to the Barrow gang, secured a donation of what is known as the McBride Home from the Wesley Rankin Foundation. “Fort Smith is a Bonnie and Clyde town,” Hill said of wanting to see it in Fort Smith. “They used the Dennis Motel on Midland as a hideout; they likely robbed the Monroe Store, which is now Arlie Muck’s downtown, for clothes after a shootout in Joplin, Mo. And they also likely robbed a Fort Smith cigar store.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Been meaning to return that overdue library book but worried about the dent that will put in your pocketbook? Worry no more, Mayor Eric Garcetti says: Beginning this spring, Los Angeles’ 73 public library branches will no longer collect fines for overdue books. “The burden of the fines placed on Angelenos is significant – for students, for families who don’t have a lot of spending money, for seniors on a fixed income,” Garcetti says. The move continues a trend that has seen public libraries in other major U.S. cities eliminate fines in an effort to make public libraries accessible to more people. LA libraries currently charge 35 cents a day for overdue books, audio books and magazines and 15 cents for children’s books. Late CDs and DVDs accrue fines of $1 a day. Libraries will still seek reimbursement for lost items.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A local radio station has canceled a scheduled program after one of the hosts said a school shooting would help break up media coverage of impeachment proceedings. Chuck Bonniwell from the show “Chuck & Julie” was complaining Tuesday about an abundance of media coverage on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. “You wish for a nice school shooting to interrupt the monotony,” Bonniwell said. His co-host and wife, Julie Hayden, immediately reprimanded him and told listeners not to call in. Radio executives immediately canceled the show. KNUS-AM gave an official statement on its website stating that the 1-4 p.m. weekday slot would now feature the Salem Network show America First hosted by Sebastian Gorka.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers on Wednesday approved a long-awaited $1.8 billion settlement agreement reached between Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and the state’s hospital association that will trigger the withdrawal of legal claims that potentially exposed the state to as much as $4 billion in liability. Both Democrats and Republicans noted the seven-year deal marks a new chapter in the state’s relationship with the hospitals, which was rocky under former Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s tenure. Lawmakers returned to the state Capitol for a special session Wednesday to vote on the hospital agreement, as well as as second bill that attempts to address concerns raised by restaurant owners facing class-action lawsuits over state wage and hour rules. Among other things, the bill repeals a regulation that governs when restaurant workers are paid the “tip wage,” which is lower than the minimum wage. The state labor commissioner must adopt new regulations.\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: The town has approved guidelines that would allow the annual Hummer’s Parade to continue on New Year’s Day despite last year’s controversy over a float that portrayed migrant children in cages. News outlets report city officials approved the guidelines Wednesday. The guidelines say Middletown “does not, either by express or implied means endorse, adopt, condemn nor condone any particular expression of free speech by any parade applicant or participant. The Town cannot, and will not, attempt to unlawfully regulate the exercise of free speech.” The city’s website says the event modeled after Philadelphia’s Mummer’s Parade is not affiliated with the town and is “haphazardly thrown together” by residents, making fun of each year’s events. The 2019 parade caused officials and community activists to cry foul, saying spoofing the humanitarian crisis at the border was mean-spirited and considered to be “punching down.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two brothers want the rest of the country to experience mumbo sauce, a condiment unique to the D.C. area that can be sweet, tangy or spicy, WUSA-TV reports. The sauce, usually dark orange or red, is best known for being sold in D.C.’s Chinese carry-out restaurants, despite it being started in the black community years ago. Andrew and Nyles Burton created their own version of the district’s quintessential sauce in their family’s kitchen and named their sauce “Uncle Dell’s Mambo Sauce,” selling it through their company, Andy Factory. Chicago and D.C both lay claim to mumbo sauce. The company Select Brands was first to market it, but many D.C. residents disagree with the Windy City’s ownership of the name. Andrew Burton says the Midwestern version is “more like a barbecue sauce.” But Select Brands retains a trademark for “mumbo sauce,” hence the spelling of the brothers’ product as “mambo sauce.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: A woman caught up in what she calls the magic of Christmas accidentally hugged a stranger at a gas station parking lot, and now the video is going viral. Mary Katherine Backstrom says she was feeling the holiday cheer, so she bought a soda for the woman in line in front of her. She left the store and saw a stranger cleaning her windshield. Delighted, she hugged the man and excitedly told him, “This is my favorite part of humanity. I love Christmas so much. Thank you for doing this.” Turns out it wasn’t her car. His car just looked like hers. The two had a good laugh, and the popular mommy blogger recounted the incident in an online video that has more than 78 million views. She appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Tuesday and was presented with an oversized check for $20,000. The 35-year-old says she’s not sure what she and her husband will do with the money but will likely use it to fuel some random acts of kindness.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWoodbine: A decision that could have determined whether a Camden County site meets environmental requirements to launch rockets was put on hold at the request of officials. The Federal Aviation Administration delayed an environmental impact statement for the proposed spaceport. It was originally scheduled for release Monday, but the county decided to amend its license application, causing an indefinite hold as the new application materials are reviewed, FAA environmental specialist Stacey Zee told news outlets. The environmental assessment is more than a year overdue from its original FAA deadline, The Brunswick News reports. Camden County has spent more than $7 million over the past 4 years to establish the spaceport at an old, abandoned industrial site near the Georgia coast.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii chain Zippy’s Restaurants has signed a deal to continue serving Dave’s Ice Cream in all of its 24 locations, officials say. Zippy’s says the contract with Honolulu-based Dave’s takes effect immediately, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The arrangement will result in annual servings of at least 23,500 gallons of vanilla and 16,000 gallons of chocolate ice cream from Dave’s as dessert and in milkshakes, Zippy’s says. The bankruptcy last month of national food and beverage firm Dean Foods caused concern at Dave’s, owner Dave Leong said. The 37-year-old company in Honolulu’s Pearl City area distributed its desserts under a wholesale arrangement with Dallas-based Dean Foods subsidiary Meadow Gold Dairies-Hawaii. Meadow Gold plans to supply its Hawaii customers from a Utah plant beginning next month, cutting off a third of Dave’s business, or more than $1 million annually.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Public land managers say the number of eagles flocking to northern Idaho’s Lake Coeur d’Alene has unexpectedly dropped. Bureau of Land Management biologist Carrie Hugo counted 223 eagles last week, The Spokesman-Review reports. Last year Hugo counted 367 eagles. BLM spokeswoman Suzanne Endsley says the decline may be related to the conclusion of kokanee salmon spawning. She says next week’s count will determine if the eagles have moved on from the area, perhaps because they are focusing on other food sources like Lake Pend Oreille.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday rejected an effort to delay marijuana sales until July 1. The ordinance was defeated by 10 votes, a day after a council committee approved a delay amid complaints that minorities were being left out of ownership of Chicago marijuana businesses. “This has been percolating for months, yet we are told to wait our turn,” said Alderman Leslie Hairston, who is black. “The only people who benefit from this deal are white people. We get thrown in jail, and they get thrown in the bank.” Marijuana sales become legal in Illinois on Jan. 1. Mayor Lori Lightfoot had opposed any delay in Chicago, saying concerns over diversity could be addressed without a postponement. Alderman Jason Ervin said African Americans have “zero representation” among owners of 11 medical marijuana dispensaries that would quickly make the transition to recreational sales Jan. 1.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A member of the state’s congressional delegation is using Legos to explain the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Democratic Rep. Andre Carson’s Twitter feed has been peppered with pictures of a Lego figurine that bears a striking resemblance to Trump. In an attempt to demonstrate the charges against the president, Carson used Lego bricks to give detailed breakdowns of both articles of impeachment by having the toys act out what Trump is accused of doing. Carson says he had the help of a staffer who was part of a Lego fan club. Together, they wanted to create something that was easy to digest for citizens following the story. Comic book-style text bubbles help explain the action, and it ends with a re-creation of Wednesday’s impeachment vote with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the podium.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: A man is trying to regain custody of a young coyote he says has become his emotional support animal. “This animal is a dog in a coyote’s body,” Matthew Stokes says of Drifter, a youngster who Stokes says was left by a coyote family that had dug a den this past spring in his backyard on the outskirts of Waterloo. Drifter was an orphaned pup “looking for a pack. I became his pack,” Stokes says. He told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier he was suffering at the time from a bone infection in a foot and was in danger of losing it, but Drifter kept him going. The pup was corralled by a neighbor while roaming the area in October and placed with a wildlife rehab agency. “This is not an emotional support animal. This is a wild coyote,” says Tracy Belle, director of WildThunder Wildlife and Animal Rehabilitation and Sanctuary. Drifter is young and seems docile, Belle says, but his adult behavior and predatory instincts have yet to kick in.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: Getting stopped by police was joyful this week for some residents of this Kansas City suburb. KMBC-TV reports Officer Ryanne Stevens was among the elves doling out $100 bills on Wednesday in Shawnee. After pulling over a van for a minor traffic infraction, she learned that the driver’s wife has multiple sclerosis. She explained that a Secret Santa had donated cash and that she thought the man “might be a good recipient of that money.” Another unsuspecting driver hugged Stevens, telling her, “Thank you so much, God bless you.” This is the fifth year the Secret Santa has donated $10,000 for Shawnee police to hand out. “I think it’s awesome,” Stevens said. “I think we have a really good community that we live in that’s very supportive of us and what we do.”\n\nKentucky\n\nPrestonsburg: At least 15 horses have been fatally shot at a strip mine site in eastern Kentucky, authorities say. The horses were found on a site along U.S. 23 near the Floyd-Pike County line, WYMT-TV reports. A $500 reward is being offered for information on the shootings. Tonya Conn with Dumas Rescue, an animal rescue group, says the dead horses were scattered over a large area, and it appears they were hunted. “Seeing them gunned down is … beyond horrific,” Conn says. Authorities say some of the horses were young, and some were pregnant. “It looked like a battlefield for just horses,” says Floyd County Sheriff John Hunt, who notes that the animals appear to have been feeding at the time, as one “had grass in its mouth.” He says the person responsible could face animal cruelty charges at a minimum.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: City officials are fast-tracking work on a broken sewer line that briefly had them considering dumping sewage into the Mississippi River. The New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board adopted an emergency declaration Wednesday to fix a valve on the line in the Gentilly neighborhood. The declaration will speed bidding and repairs on the valve, currently held open by a hydraulic jack and wooden wedges, the Times Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Crews discovered the problem Dec. 2 and tried for hours to get the broken valve open. As sewage backed up, the agency considered dumping it in the river to prevent it from spilling onto streets or causing an even more serious blowout. Wednesday’s meeting came days after two explosions involving the city’s sewage and water systems.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Fourteen nonprofit groups are receiving grants to help make sure difficult-to-count communities in the state are included in the 2020 census. The grants are from the Maine Census Outreach Fund 2020, a funding effort supported by the Maine Philanthropy Center. The grants range from $5,000 to $15,000 and will help pay for work such as community events, phone banking, adult education programs and other efforts. Organizers of the funding effort say the extra work will help make sure everyone is counted. That includes communities that often go undercounted, such as tribal groups, rural residents and young children. Groups receiving grants include Maine Access Immigrant Network, Maine Children’s Alliance and Maine Equal Justice. Organizers say one of the reasons the count is important is that the census plays a role in determining federal funding.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: As counties and universities in the state face increasing pressure to end their partnerships with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cecil County’s is recently “operational,” according to an ICE spokeswoman. Cecil is one of three Maryland counties – with Frederick and Harford – that currently have what are known as 287(g) agreements with the federal agency. Through these agreements, ICE trains and authorizes police officers at local detention centers to screen inmates for breaking immigration laws. Two Cecil County officers completed a four-week training in September, ICE spokeswoman Kate Pote says. Though the 287(g) training programs do not come with federal funds, other programs with the immigration agency – to house inmates and train ICE employees – have brought in millions in revenue to a few Maryland localities and universities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The mayor says President Donald Trump needs to “learn some history” after he claimed those accused in the city’s infamous 17th-century witch trials received more due process than he has during impeachment proceedings. Democratic Mayor Kim Driscoll wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the trials in 1692 included “powerless, innocent victims” who were “hanged or pressed to death” on scant evidence. Twenty people suspected of witchcraft were killed in Salem during a frenzy stoked by superstition, fear of disease and strangers, and jealousy. The allegations against Trump, in contrast, are against a powerful world leader and come with “ample evidence” and “admissions of wrongdoing,” Driscoll says. “This situation is much different than the plight of the witch trial victims, who were convicted using spectral evidence + then brutally hanged or pressed to death. A dubious legal process that bears no relation to televised impeachment.”\n\nMichigan\n\nMorenci: The American Civil Liberties Union is defending 14 Amish families in a dispute with a county health department over outhouses and plumbing. The Lenawee County Health Department has filed lawsuits asking a judge to order property owners to comply with county waste disposal rules or face demolition. In response Wednesday, lawyers for the families said their way of living is not a threat, and they accused the county of violating religious freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. “The county is persecuting this Amish community because of their deeply held religious beliefs that have safely guided their way of life for generations,” said Phil Mayor, an ACLU attorney. In counterclaims against the county, lawyers for the families said they adhere to “simple living” and avoid modern technology.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Health will use a $3.3 million federal grant to minimize lead hazards in older homes across the state’s southeastern region. Southeastern Minnesota has higher rates of elevated lead levels in children compared to other parts of the state, according to health officials. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant will help low-income families rehabilitate older homes that still have lead-based paint. “Lead-based paint in older homes remains the single greatest cause of elevated lead levels in Minnesota children,” says Stephanie Yendell, the health department’s lead poisoning prevention program supervisor. The health department will partner with the cities of Rochester and Winona, as well as community organizations in a dozen counties. The grant will allow for lead abatement in 151 homes, 31 in Rochester.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A wrongful death lawsuit claims a diabetic inmate, jailed for allegedly violating her own protection order, died while pleading for insulin from authorities and medical personnel who largely ignored her. The woman’s daughter, Kayla Rush, is suing Jackson County, the sheriff’s office, sheriff, jailers and the then-contracted health care provider, The Sun Herald of Biloxi reports. She’s seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages for negligence, pain and failure to provide Cindy Michelle Arnold, 38, with standard medical care. “People who are in jail are even more vulnerable because they don’t have access their own medicine,” says Rush’s attorney, Christopher Klotz. Arnold was found dead in September 2018, just two days after being arrested and charged with violating her protective order against her former common-law husband. Authorities say she called her ex and invited him to her home, where they got into a dispute.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A lawmaker wants to put the brakes on transportation officials’ use of playful messages on electronic signs along state highways, such as “Santa’s Coming Have You Been A Good Driver” and “Treat the Road Like a Cat Video … Share It.” “Those signs are hideously expensive, and (the Missouri Department of Transportation) has a lot of incredibly detailed information they could share,” says Rep. Tony Lovasco, R-O’Fallon. “But rather than sharing that information with people, they make puns about Santa Claus.” Under a bill he introduced last week, the department would be allowed to use the signs only to convey information about traffic conditions, weather or emergency alerts. Jon Nelson, assistant to the State Highway Safety and Traffic Engineer, says he displays that sort of information whenever needed, but when the roads are clear, the department can “take the opportunity to let people know about simple things they can do to make Missouri a safer place to drive.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: President Donald Trump has signed a bill into law to name a post office in the city in honor of Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress. Rankin was born near Missoula on June 11, 1880. She studied at the University of Montana, graduating in 1902 with a bachelor’s of science degree in biology, and was a social worker before becoming involved in the women’s suffrage movement. Rankin’s advocacy work was instrumental in granting women the right to vote in Montana in 1914 and was significant in initiating legislation that eventually became the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting voting rights to women, according to a state House bill passed earlier this year to name a piece of Interstate 90 in Montana in her honor. Rankin, a Republican, voted against the United States entering World War I and World War II, saying she could not vote for war.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: A truck maintenance shop will be the first new building erected at the city’s airport as part of the relocation of Nebraska National Guard units, the state adjutant general says. Maj. Gen. Daryl Bohac said Wednesday that the guard expects to begin construction of the garage during the 2021-2022 federal fiscal year, and a new readiness center will follow by the late 2020s. The center will replace the North Platte armory that’s been in service since 1956, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The armory and the old garage behind the armory have have served the guard well, Bohac said, but “they’re not as well-organized as they could be in terms of training.” The new airport complex will meet post-9/11 standards calling for a minimum 40-acre campus with greater distance between the front gate and the facilities, he said.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state wants a federal judge to declare illegal what it calls the U.S. government’s “secret plutonium smuggling operation” and order the removal of weapons-grade material already shipped to a security site north of Las Vegas over the state’s objections. The latest filing in a yearlong legal battle asks U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno to reject the government’s motion to dismiss the state’s lawsuit. Nevada is challenging the Energy Department’s covert shipment of the highly radioactive material from South Carolina last year. The department insists the issue is moot because it already has promised that no more plutonium will be brought to Nevada. The federal government says that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 gives the U.S. sole responsibility for regulation of radioactive material and that the Supreme Court has said states have “no role” in its transportation, handling and disposal.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBradford: A logger has been ordered to pay $10,000 for repeated violations of the state’s forestry laws. Officials said in a joint statement Tuesday that this is the first civil penalty imposed on a logger in Bradford under the state’s Enhanced Penalty Timber Law. Under the 2011 bill, the state’s Forest Protection Bureau and attorney general can seek financial penalties for repeated logging violations in a seven-year period, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Fines are calculated on a point system, where each conviction can earn up to three points. The money collected from civil penalties is placed in a fund for forest protection. Officials say Michael Carter has pleaded guilty to nine forestry-related offenses over a span of two years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nElizabeth: Immigrants in the Garden State without formal legal status will be allowed to get driver’s licenses after Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill Thursday, capping years of pressure from activists and supporters. The bill signing came three days after the state Assembly and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, passed the measure that had been stalled despite months of demonstrations across the state. State officials have said they expect it to be at least a year before the actual licenses are issued. Hundreds of immigrants who likely will benefit from the new law cheered and watched Murphy at Snyder Academy in Elizabeth, where nearly two years ago a coalition of organizations launched the Let’s Drive NJ campaign that aimed to get support for the controversial measure.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A suspected robber who face-planted into a Pizza Hut door before fleeing has been arrested thanks to the DNA evidence he left behind, police said. Markell Deshaun Barnes, 19, was taken into custody last week in Albuquerque after a forensic laboratory matched his DNA, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports. According to police, officers had swabbed the door for possible DNA evidence from the June 2019 robbery of a Pizza Hut in Las Cruces. Investigators took the DNA after reviewing surveillance images and seeing the 19-year-old face-planting into a locked door. Barnes is suspected in another Las Cruces robbery that same day at a gas station. He has been charged with one third-degree felony count of attempted armed robbery and one fourth-degree felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The governor has proposed a ban on single-use food and beverage containers made from polystyrene foam. The ban on the containers commonly known as Styrofoam would go into effect Jan. 1, 2022, and would also include packing peanuts, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Environmental groups have sought foam bans amid rising public awareness of throwaway plastic that accumulates in the oceans. States including Maine and Vermont joined dozens of communities this year from Berkeley, California, to New York City that have already passed their own bans. “From take-out containers to packing peanuts, this material is everywhere, and it will continue to pollute our waters and harm our wildlife for generations to come if we do not act,” Cuomo said. Democratic state Sen. Todd Kaminsky said he’s confident the Democratic-led Legislature would welcome the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Rainy weather has delayed plans to change the exit numbers on the Business Interstate 40 Improvements Project, officials say. The N.C. Department of Transportation had scheduled to begin making the changes Tuesday and continue through Friday, but an update from the department said the weather forced the delay. When weather permits, workers will close one lane in either direction of the highway so they can safely change the exit numbers to show those for U.S. 421. The name of the corridor will also change from Business Interstate 40 to Salem Parkway. Drivers will not see double exit number signs, N.C. Department of Transportation Resident Engineer Larry Shaver said. Because the work won’t take place in one night, drivers will likely see new U.S. 421 exit signs directly followed by the Business 40 exit signs being replaced.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A popular but cash-poor 3D printer business in Colorado is relocating to North Dakota. Gov. Doug Burgum announced Wednesday that the LulzBot brand of 3D printers will be manufactured by Fargo Additive Manufacturing Equipment 3D, or FAME 3D. The company plans to bring 13 employees from Colorado and hire an additional 50 workers for the Fargo plant. FAME 3D last month bought out Aleph Objects Inc., the Loveland, Colorado, company that was making the printers. Before its financial problems, it employed more than 100 people, most of whom were laid off. FAME 3D spokesman Ron Bergan said 10,000 LulzBot printers were made a year ago. The LulzBot TAZ Workhorse and TAZ Pro sell for about $5,000, and the Mini 2 costs about $1,500, Bergan said. “For years I’ve been saying everyone is going to have a 3D printer in their home,” Bergan said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: High-speed internet would spread to about 1 million unserved or underserved Ohioans along rural routes and highways previously off-limits to private development under a strategic plan released Thursday. If approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the aggressive blueprint for expanding and improving broadband access across the state also would give extra points to local governments’ applications for related federal grants. The improvements are vital because Ohio’s lack of connectivity is putting the state at a disadvantage, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement. The plan emerged from a fact-finding effort by DeWine’s administration, which identified a number of causes in September for the problem being so stubborn, particularly in Appalachia. Besides access to roadway rights, it found outdated tax codes, missed funding opportunities, bureaucratic red tape and faulty service maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Education advocates are fighting to keep four-day school weeks as the state school board proposes new restrictions that could threaten the shortened schedules. Supporters of the shortened weeks say the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s rules would force most districts to restore five-day schedules, The Oklahoman reports. Of the state’s 525 public school districts, 113 operate four days a week. The department created a list of rules in response to state legislation passed this year that set the minimum length of a school year to 165 days instead of 180 days or 1,080 hours. Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 441 to make it more difficult for schools to operate on shorter schedules. Some Republicans have said four-day school weeks will tarnish the state’s reputation and diminish students’ education. Districts will be exempt from the bill if they meet the department’s requirements.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A transgender woman from the state is suing Miss USA pageants, saying its rule that limits competition to “natural born female” is a form of gender discrimination. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Anita Green of Clackamas, Oregon, holds the title of 2019 Miss Earth Elite Oregon and competed in the 2018 Miss Montana contest. She applied to participate in the Miss United States of America pageant last year, but her application was rejected. This policy is discriminatory because it denied her the full and equal advantages and privileges of the defendant’s services in violation of Oregon’s public accommodations law, the lawsuit says. The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon. Though the Nevada-based pageant is a private business, the suit contends that the way it operates requires it to follow Oregon public accommodation law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nErie: A coke plant in northwestern Pennsylvania abruptly shut down Thursday morning amid mounting regulatory pressure over its environmental record. Erie Coke Corp. employed more than 130 people at the plant, which uses coal to produce foundry coke, a key ingredient in the steelmaking process. Workers who showed up at the plant to begin their shifts were turned away. “We just got here, and they said we don’t have a job,” employee Justin Pastuha, who stood at the entrance to the plant Thursday morning with about a dozen other workers, told the Erie Times-News. Erie Coke said in a statement later Thursday that it was “discontinuing operations.” The company blamed the city of Erie’s recent decision to block Erie Coke from discharging its wastewater through the municipal sewer system.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State Senate leaders say they won’t support legalizing recreational marijuana if Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo chooses to propose it next year. Legalizing recreational marijuana for adult use will have a negative impact on the state’s youth, and education is already suffering, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio says. Raimondo has said she’s likely to propose legalizing recreational marijuana in her upcoming 2020 budget. The General Assembly denied her attempts to propose legislation in the last budget, but six new medical marijuana dispensaries were authorized in the state. Ruggerio says he supports legalizing medical marijuana, which lawmakers approved in 2007, but believes stronger regulation is needed for the program. Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, also a Democrat says he’s wary of how legalization could affect worker safety and federal work requirements for defense contracts and how impaired drivers will be tested.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Police Chief Ken Miller has been placed on administrative leave following the outcome of a state investigation. Mayor Knox White confirmed Thursday afternoon that Miller was put on leave while City Manager John McDonough evaluates the case. Knox said McDonough informed City Council members via text message Thursday. McDonough did not immediately return calls for comment. City spokeswoman Leslie Flether later confirmed via email that both Miller and interim Capt. Jason Rampey have been placed on paid administrative leave. Deputy Chief Howie Thompson has been made the acting police chief, Fletcher said. City leaders are weighing exactly how to handle evidence from a State Law Enforcement Division investigation that suggests Miller worked to get a wealthy businessman’s public-intoxication charge dropped.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A new insect pest is appearing in Christmas greenery, state agricultural officials said Wednesday. The pest is known as the elongate hemlock scale. South Dakota’s state forester Greg Josten said the Asian insect was detected by the state’s forest health team in wreaths last Christmas. The insect was found on wreaths made of fir that were shipped in from the southern U.S., Josten said. The insect has appeared on similar greenery this year. The South Dakota Department of Agriculture has put a stop order on the sale of the material. But wreath material does not have to be destroyed until after the holidays. The insect will infest hemlock, fir and spruce trees and suck sap from the foliage, causing the foliage to become discolored and drop. The pest has not been found on Christmas trees in South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: People looking for an escape high in the Smoky Mountains will soon be able to vacation even higher when eight rentals designed and constructed in the trees by “Treehouse Master” Pete Nelson open next spring. Treehouse Grove at Norton Creek will be part of Gatlinburg’s relatively new Norton Creek Resort, whose executive vice president, Joseph Ayres, says it is still “relatively small.” The resort currently has just four or five rental homes available, and about a year and a half ago, Ayres started looking for ways to grow and set the resort apart in an area where cabin rentals are essentially around every corner. Nelson landed on eight fascinating designs, which are under construction and will feature essential amenities, plus access to acres of wilderness. He has built some of the world’s most jaw-dropping tree houses, many of which were documented on his Animal Planet show “Treehouse Masters.”\n\nTexas\n\nTemple: A small police department’s silence about what prompted an officer to fatally shoot a man in the head nearly three weeks ago deviates from how some other recent police shootings in the state were handled, and law enforcement experts warn it risks stirring public mistrust. Officer Carmen DeCruz has been on paid leave since the Dec. 2 shooting of 28-year-old Michael Dean in Temple, about 70 miles northeast of Austin. The department has released no information other than the names and that blood was found in Dean’s car. A preliminary autopsy released by the county found Dean was killed by a shot to the head and classified his death a homicide. Beyond that, there has been been no official account of the shooting, leaving open questions about how the two men came into contact and what led DeCruz to open fire.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A new report says the state’s high school graduation rate has increased for the seventh consecutive year. The state Board of Education released data Monday stating that 43,500 students graduated from district and charter high schools, representing about 90% who entered as freshmen four years earlier. The overall graduation rate increased by 0.4% since last year and is up by more than 3% in the past five years, board officials said. Monticello High School was one of 14 schools to have a 100% graduate rate, meaning each of its 300 seniors enrolled graduated, officials said. Last year, there were 10. Some of the overall gains could be attributed to increased graduation rates among some of the larger demographic groups including students with disabilities, board spokesman Mark Peterson said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three public drinking water systems have levels of a class of toxic chemicals above the state standard, the Department of Environmental Conservation says. The department says the three systems exceeding PFAS levels are Fiddlehead Condominiums in Fayston, the Killington Mountain School and the Mount Holly Elementary School. Each water system has notified its users that the levels are above Vermont’s 20 parts per trillion standard and issued a “Do Not Drink” notice. The department says the condominiums system serves 60 users, the Killington school serves 125 users, and the Mount Holly School serves 120 users. PFAS were used in a host of materials, including firefighting foam and nonstick cookware, but are now raising health concerns.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state is going to replace nearly 10,000 highway lights with LED lights that use less energy and increase visibility, according to Gov. Ralph Northam. Northam on Wednesday announced a new contract with Trane to replace more than 9,600 lights on Virginia roads, rest areas and weigh stations. He said the upgrade will result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and save the state $4.6 million by 2036. The new lights are expected use reduce energy consumption by 50% and will start being installed in the spring of 2020.\n\nWashington\n\nPullman: Police say a man who had just been released from jail helped himself to some presents under a Christmas tree in the police department’s lobby – only to find out they were fake. News outlets report video from the Pullman Police Department shows a 20-year-old Washington State University student after he had been held on suspicion of underage drinking walk up to the tree and take several packages. But as he walks outside, the video shows him realize the packages were just there for show and were in fact empty. Video then shows the man tossing the empty boxes across the parking lot in frustration. The person who picked him up went after the fake presents and put them outside the police department’s door. Police say no charges are being sought.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: The West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine says it is looking for patients for its free annual osteopathic clinic. The medical school has opened registration for its Student Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Clinic, which provides free osteopathic evaluations and other treatments to people who live in Lewisburg and surrounding areas. The school says procedures are performed by students under the supervision of physicians. The program runs on Wednesdays between Jan. 8 and Feb. 5 and then from Feb. 12 to March 11 at the school’s Clinical Evaluation Center in Lewisburg. Potential patients must have a written referral from a doctor, physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner before scheduling an appointment with the clinic.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The state’s residents could be facing their largest property tax increase in 10 years, a report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum finds. “School property taxes across Wisconsin are rising by more than $220 million on December 2019 tax bills, which suggests – when combined with increases in county and technical college district levies – that Wisconsin residents could see their largest property tax increase in a decade,” the report says. School districts across the state are collectively raising K-12 schools’ portion of the property tax levy by 4.5%, a result of state budget changes and referendums approved by individual districts’ voters to exceed state revenue limits, the report finds. School districts levied $5.21 billion in 2019-20 property taxes compared with $4.99 billion in 2018-19, the report says.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A pair of wolf pups were fatally hit by a vehicle after the animals became used to humans and started hanging around a road near their den, park officials say. The pups were hit at about sunset Tuesday on the road between Tower Junction and the park’s northeast entrance. The animals were from the Junction Butte pack, a group of wolves that ranges between the Lamar Valley and Tower Junction and is frequently seen by visitors. Park officials say in recent months some hikers had violated a requirement to stay 100 yards from wolves and approached the pups to take their photo. After becoming accustomed to people, the pups began coming close to visitors along the road prior to being killed. Yellowstone had about 80 wolves living in nine packs, according to the latest population count.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/09/cast-blues-wedding-dress-scare-rhino-escape-news-around-states/118789038/", "title": "Cast of Blues, wedding dress scare: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state attorney general’s office is trying to revive its lawsuit over the removal of a Confederate monument from outside a courthouse in the city. The state claimed in court documents that a judge shouldn’t have dismissed the suit just because someone anonymously paid a $25,000 fine that was owed by Madison County for removing the statue nearly a year ago, WHNT-TV reports. Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office contends the county should be required to pay the penalty itself. A judge scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon on the state’s bid to reinstate the lawsuit. The state sued the county last year seeking a $25,000 penalty that’s mandated under a state law that makes it illegal to remove or alter monuments. Madison County asked a judge to end the state’s suit after someone deposited $25,000 into a court account to pay the fine Aug. 27. The county says the money isn’t from taxpayers or Madison County but hasn’t said where it came from. Circuit Judge Claude Hundley dismissed the suit, but the state argues it needs to know who paid the fine to end the case. It also says the judge still needs to rule on its claim that Madison County broke the law by moving the monument, erected in 1905 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to a city-owned cemetery.\n\nAlaska\n\nNewtok: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pace of moving residents from a community threatened by erosion to another village, officials said. Money also has been an issue. Nine homes in the new village of Mertarvik that were started last year remain unfinished, and no one has moved from Newtok to Mertarvik since 2019, KYUK Public Media reports. Newtok had an estimated 220 residents last year. “We couldn’t get any cabinets because of this COVID thing,” said Phillip Carl, Newtok acting tribal administrator. Patrick LeMay, who is leading the building effort in Mertarvik, said shortages for materials have persisted. “We got 48 lights that are trapped somewhere in Tennessee floods, to finish the lighting. There’s a shortage of fire extinguishers in the nation,” LeMay said. “The supply chain has been a disaster.” Many of the workers building homes in Mertarvik are Newtok residents. LeMay said three workers from Newtok contracted COVID-19 in August. Many remaining laborers chose to stop working due to concerns about an outbreak, KYUK reports. Newtok recently experienced its biggest outbreak since the pandemic began, with 32 residents testing positive for the coronavirus last month. About 42% of its population is vaccinated. Meanwhile, Carl said Newtok has lost over 100 feet of its coast since April.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Tuesday that Tucson’s vaccine mandate for its employees is illegal, giving the city 30 days to repeal it or risk losing millions of dollars in state funding. Democratic-led Tucson has repeatedly clashed with the state’s Republican leadership over the city’s aggressive efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. City Manager Michael Ortega said he put the mandate on hold while Tucson develops its legal position in response to the attorney general’s decision. Brnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate in a crowded Republican primary, cited a state law approved this summer that bans local governments from mandating vaccines for employees, though it doesn’t take effect until later this month. He also cited an August executive order signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. “Adhering to the rule of law in Arizona is not optional,” Katie Conner, a spokeswoman for Brnovich, told reporters. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero suggested Brnovich’s decision was motivated by his Senate campaign. “This report reads more as a campaign speech filled with political commentary rather than a fact-based legal opinion,” the Democratic mayor said in a statement. City officials are reviewing their options, Romero said, and the next step will have to be decided by her and City Council.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 38 new deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday as the capital city launched a new incentive program to boost vaccinations. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the pandemic now totals 7,108. The state reported 583 new coronavirus cases, and COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by eight to 1,228. Arkansas ranks 10th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state’s top health official has warned he expects to see a surge in cases following the Labor Day weekend, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he expected an increase as well. “We have fewer cases from the Labor Day weekend, but we’ll see the effects of the holiday weekend later this week and into the next,” Hutchinson tweeted. Little Rock launched its incentive program tied to vaccination clinics it is holding, starting Saturday at the Southwest Community Center. Those who get shots at these clinics will receive a $50 VISA Rewards Card from U.S. Bank for both their first and second doses of vaccine received at a participating clinic. Those who provide proof of having gotten a first vaccine dose elsewhere and choose to get their second dose at a participating clinic, or those who receive a single-dose vaccine at a participating clinic, can receive a $100 Rewards Card.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers have moved to make the state the first to outlaw “stealthing,” which is removing a condom without permission during intercourse. Legislators sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill Tuesday adding the act to the state’s civil definition of sexual battery. It makes it illegal to remove the condom without obtaining verbal consent. But it doesn’t change the criminal code. Instead, it would amend the civil code so that a victim could sue the perpetrator for damages, including punitive damages. Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia has been pushing for the legislation since 2017, when a Yale University study said acts of stealthing were increasing against women and gay men alike. Her original bill attempted to make it a crime. But legislative analysts said at the time that the act could already be considered misdemeanor sexual battery, even if it isn’t specifically referenced in the criminal code. Even so, the analysts said it is rarely prosecuted, if only because of the difficulty in proving that a perpetrator acted intentionally instead of accidentally. Analysts this year said Garcia’s bill would remove any ambiguity in civil law. Garcia said the act can cause long-term physical and emotional harm to its victims.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city has closed Civic Center Park, one of its historic landmarks that has become a hot spot for homeless people to camp, because of safety and public health concerns, city officials said in a statement Tuesday. City officials said the park and surrounding areas have become a “hotspot for violence, crime, drug sales and substance misuse, jeopardizing the public’s ability to safely enjoy one of Denver’s treasured outdoor spaces.” Officials cited concerns about rodents, disease spread, impacts on water quality, discarded needles and other drug paraphernalia in a statement in which Mayor Michael B. Hancock said conditions had reached a “tipping point.” “This cannot and will not be allowed to continue,” Hancock said. The park was closed to the public starting Wednesday. Officials called it temporary but did not provide an exact date for its reopening. The city said it plans to restore the park’s greenery and historical stone structures that have been damaged by graffiti and fires and will require professional restoration. The park faces the state’s Capitol building and Lincoln Park, which was fenced off last summer after the city cleared a large camp of homeless people who were living there. Officials had cited health and safety concerns for issuing Lincoln Park’s cleanup, also referred to as “homeless sweeps” by local housing advocates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: An independent investigator will look into allegations of racial discrimination within the police department including unfair discipline of Black officers and a hostile work environment, city officials said. The probe is in response to claims against acting Police Chief Rebeca Garcia made by the Bridgeport Guardians, a group that represents minority officers on the force, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. City Council President Aidee Nieves said Bridgeport will be hiring an outside attorney to review the allegations. The Guardians, however, are continuing to insist that federal government officials investigate the department. Davon Polite, president of the Guardians, said there are concerns that city officials will hire a lawyer who will produce the results they want. “A federal investigation is the only way to get an impartial, fair investigation,” Polite said. The Guardians and the local NAACP branch recently requested federal oversight of the department and an investigation, alleging a widespread pattern of racial discrimination within the agency. The Guardians accuse Garcia of subjecting minority officers to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment. The group has called for her removal. The city police union voted no confidence in Garcia in March.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Chancery Court judge ruled protests may continue outside the house of Delaware Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney, denying the state’s request for a temporary restraining order. The proposed restrictions, made by the state Department of Justice after it perceived threats against the agency’s Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust head, sought to keep protesters 300 feet from Denney’s home. Demonstrators would also have to notify New Castle County Police at least 24 hours before they protested. In making her ruling Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick said there was not enough for her to go on to issue a temporary restraining order. She attributed that to the speed at which the proceedings were brought to her on Sunday of Labor Day Weekend. But she said the motion to expedite the proceeding could move forward. A date for the next hearing was not provided. Keandra McDole Ray, one of the people targeted by the motion, viewed the ruling as a positive outcome for demonstrators, who have been protesting that Denney “do his job” in the matter of Lymond Moses – a 30-year-old man killed during a Jan. 13 interaction with New Castle County Police in Wilmington.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: One of the biggest rock bands in the world will take the stage at D.C.’s 9:30 Club on Thursday night as the final part of the venue’s reopening week celebration, WUSA-TV reports. The club, which had been teasing a surprise musical guest for a few weeks, posted on social media Wednesday that the Foo Fighters had been tapped to help welcome fans back. This won’t be the first venue Dave Grohl and company have helped to reopen from long pandemic-induced closures. Back in June, the band reopened New York’s Madison Square Garden with a little help from D.C. native Dave Chappelle. But the 9:30 Club has a special connection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band’s leader. As a teenager, Grohl played drums in a band called Dane Bramage at the 9:30 Club. “As a kid growing up in the D.C. punk rock scene, your first show at the 9:30 Club might as well have been Royal Albert Hall or Madison Square Garden,” Grohl told the Washington Post in a 2010 article celebrating the venue’s 30th anniversary. The 9:30 Club is one of several D.C. venues requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of an event.\n\nFlorida\n\nIslamorada: A 148-year-old Florida Keys lighthouse could get a new life now that a community organization is poised to take ownership and begin a massive preservation project. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has approved a recommendation from the National Park Service that Islamorada-based Friends of the Pool Inc. be granted ownership of Alligator Reef Lighthouse under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The nonprofit announced the approval Tuesday. “Alligator Reef Lighthouse has stood since 1873,” project organizer Rob Dixon said. “It’s an important part of Islamorada’s local history. It’s our Statue of Liberty and needs to be saved.” Dixon said the restoration project is likely to take five to seven years and cost up to $9 million. “We’re going to need a lot of fundraising help and a lot of technical help,” he said. Friends of the Pool hosts an annual 8-mile swimming race to the offshore lighthouse and back to fund collegiate scholarships. The effort to save the lighthouse and start the “Swim for Alligator Lighthouse” event was conceived by Larry Herlth, a local metal artisan who created detailed replicas of Alligator Reef Lighthouse and other Keys lighthouses. “The six lighthouses off the Florida Keys are the biggest collection of iron piling lighthouses anywhere in the world,” Herlth said. “The history is just phenomenal.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A metro-area school district is switching to virtual learning, after two school bus drivers and a bus monitor died from COVID-19 in recent weeks. The 9,700-student Griffin-Spalding County school system, on the southern fringe of suburban Atlanta, made the announcement late Monday, citing a disruption in student transportation. Districts across Georgia are struggling to line up enough drivers and monitors to keep buses running. In Savannah, some bus drivers staged a sickout for the second day Tuesday after a similar protest Friday. At least 210,000 Georgia students in 54 districts and charter networks have had their school schedules disrupted because of COVID-19. Some districts have taken days off, some shifted to every-other-day schedules, and some sent home individual schools or grades. That’s over 12% of Georgia’s 1.7 million public school students. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals remains above 6,000, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. The number of newly reported deaths continues to rise sharply, with Georgia currently averaging more than 80 deaths a day, totaling more than 23,000 since the pandemic began. More than 34,000 coronavirus cases have been reported among children ages 5-17 in the two weeks ended Sept. 2, state Department of Public Health data shows.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A resort in the famed tourist mecca of Waikiki will be the first in the state to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all employees and guests. Starting Oct. 15, ’Alohilani Resort will require its employees, patrons and guests to show proof they’re fully inoculated. The requirement will also apply to the six other Waikiki properties owned or operated by Highgate, a real estate investment and hospitality management company. It’s the right thing to do as Hawaii grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations because of the highly contagious delta variant, said Kelly Sanders, senior vice president of operations at Highgate Hawaii. There were an average of 706 newly confirmed infection cases per day across Hawaii between Aug. 30 and Sept. 5 across Hawaii, according to the state Department of Health. Hawaii’s vaccination rate was 64%. “So I think we will be the safest hotel in Hawaii, at least for now,” Sanders said Wednesday. “And hopefully that helps our business and doesn’t hurt our business.” John De Fries, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the move a step in a the right direction and said he hopes other hotels follow suit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s move to “crisis standards of care” is allowing some hospitals to ration health care as they struggle with an onslaught of coronavirus patients, and officials are warning the procedures could spread statewide. But the main hospital affected by the designation was already operating under extreme conditions, officials said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been really at our normal standards for some time,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff for Kootenai Health, the largest hospital system in the northern half of the state. The Coeur d’Alene facility has had to move patients into a conference center, “doing things that were not normal – way outside of normal – at times,” Scoggins said. Newly confimed coronavirus infection cases are surging, and Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. At Kootenai Health, some patients are treated in converted lobbies and hallways. Urgent surgeries are on hold, and critical patients must often wait long periods of time for intensive care beds, Scoggins said. “Almost every day at this point we are having cardiac arrest from patients when their oxygen levels dip too low, and we can’t supply them with enough oxygen,” he said. An entire floor of the hospital has been turned into a COVID-19 ward, meaning medical staffers must put on full protective gear before they enter the floor.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson III has died at his home on Chicago’s North Side. He was 90. His son Adlai Stevenson IV, who confirmed the Illinois Democrat died Monday, said his father had dementia. Before his health declined, Stevenson kept active organizing presentations and speakers for the Adlai Stevenson Center on Democracy in Libertyville, Illinois. He also worked on the family farm in Hanover, Illinois, raising cattle, growing corn and hay for their feed, and chopping wood. “He just faded away,” his son said. Stevenson ran for governor of Illinois twice, losing his 1982 run by just 5,074 votes to Republican Gov. Jim Thompson – the closest election for governor in modern Illinois history. Stevenson was the great-grandson of former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, who served in the role for the second of President Grover Cleveland’s nonconsecutive terms. His father, Adlai Stevenson II, was a former Illinois governor and two-time presidential candidate. When running for the Senate, where he was first elected in 1970 to serve out the remainder of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen’s term, the third Stevenson asked then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley for advice. “My advice to you is don’t change your name,” Daley told him, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Stevenson was reelected in 1974 but decided not to run again in 1980.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Secured School Safety Board has approved more than $19 million in state grants, marking a third consecutive year the General Assembly has allocated funds for school safety investments. The awards will allow the board to fund projects proposed by 392 schools in their applications to the Secured School Safety Grant program. The program issues matching grants for school resource officers and law enforcement officers in schools, active event warning systems, firearms training for teachers and staff, threat assessments, and other safety technology and support services. Schools then match those funds at a certain level, based on average daily membership of the school district, the total amount of the project or what the request covers. “Hoosier students and staff should be able to go to school with the confidence and comfort of knowing they are safe and protected from harm. This program represents the state’s commitment to that mission,” Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement. The allocation of funds for the fiscal year includes roughly $13.4 million for school resource officers, $4.9 million for safety equipment, $642,000 for student and parent support services programs, $43,000 for active event warning services, and $6,200 for training.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: The city’s public schools will become the new owners of the historic Orpheum Theater for the basement-bargain price of $1. Marshalltown Community School District Board of Education on Tuesday unanimously approved a letter of intent to buy the theater on Main Street, the Times-Republican reports. The school district will pay the current owners, Iowa Valley Community College District, $1 for the building at closing. The closing date has been set for June 16 or sooner. The school board also approved a $20,000 purchase of a parking lot immediately east of the theater. The Orpheum closed last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Iowa Valley Community College District Chancellor Kristie Fisher said her school views the sale as more of a transfer of property from one school to another, and she’s proud the theater will remain an educational facility. “We knew it was a great community asset and so important to the greater Marshall County community that we wanted to make sure we were maximizing it,” Fisher said. She said that while the $1 sale doesn’t appear to be a money-maker for the community college district, it will save the institution the costs of operating the theater, freeing up funds for other priorities. The downtown Orpheum Theater was built in 1948.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: After months of advocacy by activists, the City Council has voted to establish a board to advise the council and city staff on environmental concerns, climate change and economic vitality. The council voted unanimously Tuesday to support Wichita’s Sustainability Integration Board, which will advise in such areas as reducing emissions and finding economic growth that is environmentally friendly. The council had listened to 27 Wichita citizens during the past six months who spoke about climate change concerns, The Wichita Eagle reports. As currently planned, the board will have 14 members and meet quarterly. Some of the advocates and some council members said the board was too big and should meet more often. The board will be able to create its own bylaws and procedures, including determining how often members meet. “I think this is a great first step forward, and I don’t think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Mayor Brandon Whipple said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers took initial steps Tuesday to block statewide mask mandates, showing their preference for local decision-making on the issue as they reconvened for a special session to assert their dominance in shaping Kentucky’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a daylong burst of action, a Senate committee advanced a measure to nullify the state school board’s requirement that anyone in a public K-12 school wear a mask. The bill would leave it up to local school boards to decide face-covering policies for their districts. A House panel advanced another bill to prevent the governor from issuing any new statewide orders requiring mask-wearing. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear previously used a mask mandate to combat the coronavirus’ spread. He lifted it but has said he would have reinstituted a requirement to counter a recent COVID-19 surge if he still had the authority. The session marks a dramatic power shift in coronavirus-related policymaking in the Bluegrass State. Since the pandemic hit Kentucky, Beshear mostly acted unilaterally in setting statewide virus policies, but the state Supreme Court shifted those decisions to the Legislature in a landmark ruling. Dozens of school districts have paused in-person learning because of virus outbreaks as the state sets records for new cases and hospitalizations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State health officials said Tuesday that they are revoking the licenses of nursing homes that evacuated residents to a warehouse where seven died amid deteriorating conditions deemed too squalid to be safe after Hurricane Ida. The seven homes – all owned by one person – “clearly failed to execute their emergency preparedness plans to provide essential care and services to their residents,” Department of Health Secretary Courtney Phillips said in a statement. Authorities found some nursing home residents lying on mattresses on the floor, without food or clean clothes, and detected strong odors of urine and feces throughout the warehouse, located in the town of Independence. Piles of trash were on the floor. Water entered the building, and generators at least temporarily failed, according to officials. Health department lawyer Stephen Russo called the conditions “inhumane.” State health officials and Attorney General Jeff Landry have launched investigations into the deaths. A police official said the Tangipahoa Parish warehouse was equipped to handle 300 to 500 people but ultimately took in more than 800. Officials said the owner, Bob Dean, failed to contact them for help and threw inspectors from the agency off the property when they arrived to review the conditions onsite after receiving reports of problems.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The late founder of the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center has become the first Black Mainer to be inducted in the state’s Franco-American Hall of Fame. Alain Jean Claude Nahimana, who died at age 49 last year, was one of three people inducted posthumously during the ceremony Tuesday at the Maine State House. The son of a Burundi ambassador who fled political turmoil, Nahimana was educated in Burundi and Switzerland before moving to Maine in 2010. He served as the president of the Burundi Community Association and as coordinator of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition before launching the immigrant welcome center. There were a dozen inductees, including former House Speaker John Martin, of Eagle Lake, and state Sen. Susan Deschambault, of Biddeford. Dignitaries who attended the event included the French ambassador to the United States, Phillippe Etienne, along with Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau. Gov. Janet Mills, who studied abroad for a year in Paris as a college student, delivered remarks in both French and English. She noted that more than a third of Maine residents have a Franco heritage.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A commission on congressional and state legislative redistricting has announced 12 public hearings. Ten of the hearings will be held in different parts of the state. The first will be Sept. 20, and the last is scheduled for Nov. 18. There also will be two statewide virtual hearings. The panel, which includes leading Democrats who control the General Assembly as well as two Republican legislative leaders, will draw maps for the state’s eight congressional districts as well as the 188 seats in the Legislature, based on new census data. Maryland’s current congressional map has been criticized as having some of the most gerrymandered and oddly-shaped districts in the nation. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1, Democrats hold a 7-1 advantage in its U.S. House delegation. Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services who is chairing the commission, said the geography should look “prettier” this time in how the maps are drawn. He noted that in the past “things have gotten pretty free-hand-drawing like.” Aro said he’s hopeful people will not feel like their communities have been “carved 16 different ways.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shortage of bus drivers in the city’s public schools has been raising concern among parents who fear some students could be left behind when the district starts a new year Thursday. Acting Mayor Kim Janey and Superintendent Brenda Cassellius have told families to expect significant delays or bus cancellations, but details were not being provided to families until Thursday morning, The Boston Globe reports. The shortage is so severe that a union for bus drivers last week urged the district to postpone the start of classes. The district’s bus fleet was short more than 60 drivers at the time, and few had been added by this week. Families and advocates worry some students could end up stranded at home or at bus stops Thursday. The Boston Special Education Parent Advisory Council has raised concerns about students who need special education services including door-to-door transportation or individual bus monitors. “I honestly don’t know what to expect now and am concerned for families that don’t have the work flexibility, income, or resources to secure alternative transportation,” said Roxi Harvey, who chairs the council.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday proposed spending $200 million in federal pandemic relief funding to replace lead water pipes across the state, where aging underground infrastructure was exposed by Flint’s disaster. The plan, if approved by the Legislature, would set aside $20 million to replace all the lines in Benton Harbor in five years. The majority-Black city in the state’s southwestern corner has been exceeding the federal lead limit since 2018. That year, Michigan began enforcing the nation’s strictest rules for lead in drinking water in the wake of the crisis in Flint, another impoverished city with a majority-Black population. The regulations will result in replacing every lead service pipe statewide by 2041 unless a utility can show regulators it will take longer. The proposal would expand upon a water plan Whitmer announced nearly a year ago, including $102 million to replace lead service lines in disadvantaged communities. In June, Republicans who control the Senate unveiled a $2.5 billion water infrastructure proposal that would be funded primarily with federal COVID-19 aid. Their plan includes $600 million for pipe replacements, triple what the governor is seeking. Whitmer said more money is needed to replace all pipes but noted an infrastructure agenda pending in Congress.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A prominent GOP donor who is charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking is now being sued by an underage girl who says he used her for sex acts, then offered her money to keep her from talking about it. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court alleges that Anton Lazzaro’s attorneys offered $1,000 in hush money to the girl and her parents to keep them quiet and asked them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The girl’s father refused and instead went to law enforcement, said their attorney, Jeff Anderson. The lawsuit, which also lists the girl’s parents as plaintiffs, alleges Lazzaro used his “power, wealth, influence, connections, and resources to recruit children … so that he could prey on them. When it became clear that Lazzaro had committed serious crimes, he attempted to coerce his victims and their families into keeping silent.” Lazzaro, 30, was charged in August with five counts of sex trafficking of minors, one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor, one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and three counts of obstruction. His attorney has said he is being falsely accused. St. Thomas University student Gisela Castro Medina, 19, the former chairwoman of the school’s Republican Party chapter, also faces criminal charges for allegedly recruiting girls for Lazzaro.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: An exhibit about blues legends and juke joints is opening soon, designed to appeal to the eyes, hands and ears. A Cast of Blues will be on display starting Saturday and running through Oct. 9 at the Historic Eureka School in Hattiesburg. It features 15 resin-cast masks of blues legends and photographs of blues performers and juke joints made by Mississippi artists. Sharon McConnell-Dickerson created the resin-cast masks, and the photographs were taken by Ken Murphy. McConnell-Dickerson, who is visually impaired, said the casts are like 3-D photographs for people who are blind. “It captures the flesh, muscle, bone, hair and subtle expressions of emotion,” she said. “I wanted to discover the faces behind the music I love, so I went to Mississippi to map out the visages of the real Delta blues men and women.” The exhibit features Braille labels, a music playlist and a closed-captioned film about the Cast of Blues project. Visitors are encouraged to touch the masks, McConnell-Dickerson said. Among the artists spotlighted are Bo Diddley and Bobby Rush. The exhibit is also accompanied by the 2008 documentary film “M for Mississippi: A Road Trip through the Birthplace of the Blues.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Several people have been treated in emergency rooms after taking the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, even as experts warn of dangerous side effects and a lack of proof that it helps treat COVID-19. Dr. Steven Brown told KMOV-TV that cases of ivermectin toxicity have occurred at Mercy hospitals across the state. “People who are relying upon ivermectin and remaining unvaccinated are under a tremendous false sense of security,” Brown said. “I have seen people with ivermectin toxicity in the emergency room from taking the animal formulation. I’ve seen people who relied on ivermectin to prevent themselves from getting COVID who are on ventilators and who have died.” This week, the American Medical Association and two pharmacist groups urged physicians, pharmacists and other prescribers to warn patients against using ivermectin, a decades-old drug used to killed worms and other parasites in humans and animals. Large studies are underway in the U.S. and overseas to determine if the drug has any effect on preventing or reducing the effects of COVID-19. Ivermectin has been promoted by GOP lawmakers, conservative talk show hosts and some doctors, amplified via social media to millions still resistant to vacines. It has also been widely used in some other countries such as India and Brazil.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s Republican attorney general is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood last month seeking to block four new laws that would restrict access to abortion in the state. The laws, set to take effect Oct. 1, would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation; restrict access to abortion pills; require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound; and prohibit insurance plans that cover abortion procedures from being offered on the federal exchange. The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen as a defendant. The state is represented in the case by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. The state asked Tuesday for the court to reject Planned Parenthood’s request to block the laws before they take effect, saying the laws will “help minimize the medical risks” during pregnancy. But medical experts and abortion advocates broadly dispute that the new laws would make the procedure safer. The suit claims the laws violate the Montana Constitution, which protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks gestation. It says the laws will reduce the number of locations where abortion services are offered and threaten providers with civil and criminal penalties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A segment of the Henry Doorly Zoo was cleared out and visitors were warned to remain inside buildings after a 5,000-pound rhinoceros briefly escaped its enclosure, officials there confirmed. The incident happened Tuesday afternoon, when zookeepers spotted an Indian rhino named Jontu outside his enclosure grazing on grass in an area adjacent to the rhino barn that’s not open to the public, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Visitors were asked to leave the area or shelter in buildings, and the zoo’s carousel and aviary were cleared of guests as a precaution. Dan Cassidy, the zoo’s vice president of animal management, said staff quickly pulled in trucks to serve as a barricade around the area to keep the rhino from wandering and used apples and leafy greens to lure him back in the barn. In all, the rhino was outside the enclosure for about 40 minutes, Cassidy said. The animal never showed any signs of aggression while outside the barn, and the public was not in danger, Cassidy said. Vets were on hand with tranquilizer guns to be used as a last resort if needed. Zoo officials believe Jontu used his nose to push open a latch on a door that wasn’t locked properly. Cassidy said staff will critique the process of corralling the rhino and are considering changing the lock on the door from which he escaped.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The president of the school board for metro Las Vegas says she’s received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had “very disturbing images” but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. “We have no time for hate,” she said. The district board voted Sept. 1 for a vaccination requirement that the district superintendent will draft and implement. The district hasn’t yet released details of the mandate. As approved by the board, the plan will include a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs. Amid talk of a protest against the mandate, the district said Tuesday that staff member absences were about double from the day after Labor Day in 2019. The district said the callouts accounted for less than 5% of the CCSD workforce and noted that staff could have called out for a variety of reasons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A family that lost a nearly 185-year-old barn on their farm that’s been the backdrop for political events for Republican politicians has sunflowers in the spot for now and recently celebrated a grand reopening. The fire burned down a four-story, 80-foot-long barn at the Scamman Farm in Stratham in May. “It’s just so beautiful, and we’ve been getting a lot of phone calls through the summer asking if they can come take photos in the sunflower patch,” farm manager Sue Fernholz said. “It shows that there’s beauty in life after tragedy.” Fernholz said the sunflowers were planted to pay tribute to the sister of a family friend who died last year. The farm, which reopened last week, also features corn mazes, hayrides, pumpkin patch and other attractions. The family still plans to rebuild the barn once two other buildings are repaired. “We’re going to take the winter to figure out what our needs are (for the new barn),” Kirk Scamman said. Former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, had visited the farm. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his campaign there, and Republican Scott Brown announced his U.S. Senate run there in 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFair Lawn: One school district is getting creative with ways to allow students to get mask-free fresh air during the day. The Fair Lawn district has set up 32 tents at its 10 schools for outdoor lunch, and at Fair Lawn High School, two additional tents are available for outdoor classes, said Superintendent Nicholas Norcia. The first day of school last Friday had a delayed start because of flooding, and the schools have been closed this week until Thursday for the Rosh Hashana holiday. The principals will be working with teachers to determine a schedule for outdoor classrooms so that everyone can get a chance to use them, Norcia said. On Friday, Norcia visited a few schools. “The students were excited to be outside in beautiful weather, eating lunch,” he said. “They were having the best time ever, and it was so great to see.” As of now, the schedule will allow for half the students to eat lunch outside while the other half are inside, and they will rotate. While in the tents, students don’t need to wear masks, Norcia said. Meanwhile, some school districts along the Jersey shore have been lifting mask mandates, citing excessive heat and insufficient air conditioning in classrooms.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expansion of nonmerit scholarships to college and greater spending to safeguard abandoned oil wells in the state are among the governor’s new spending priorities, amid a windfall in income linked to federal pandemic relief and petroleum production. September marks the outset of the Legislature’s grueling budget-writing process for the year beginning July 1, 2022. Several executive agencies overseen by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are making the case for expanded services. Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said Tuesday that the inclination is to “aim high” and “make the most of the opportunity we have to finish the work of rebuilding state government services after so many years of forced austerity.” The Human Services Department is suggesting a $100 million spending increase on Medicaid and related mental health services alone, for total annual general fund spending of $1.26 billion on the program. State income for the coming fiscal year is expected to outpace routine annual spending obligations by $1.4 billion, or 19% of annual general fund spending obligations. That leaves lawmakers more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The remains of two people who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack at the World Trade Center were positively identified this week, as officials continued the difficult and heart-wrenching task of returning victims to their families. The announcement came days before the 20th anniversary of an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people when hijacked commercial jets flew into the twin towers, struck the Pentagon and crashed into a Pennsylvania meadow. “No matter how much time passes since Sept. 11, 2001, we will never forget, and we pledge to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure all those who were lost can be reunited with their families,” said Dr. Barbara A. Sampson, the chief medical examiner of the city of New York. Technicians in the medical examiner’s office have been working for years to match thousands of body fragments recovered from the World Trade Center rubble with known victims but haven’t been able to extract useable DNA in many cases. The identifications announced Tuesday were the first since October 2019. One set of remains was linked to Dorothy Morgan, of Hempstead, New York, who was a broker for Marsh & McLennan. Officials also matched remains recovered in 2001, 2002 and 2006 to a single victim, whose family asked that his name be withheld.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden approved a request Wednesday for federal funds to be made available to residents of western North Carolina who saw major flooding last month due to Tropical Storm Fred. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper sought the emergency declaration for federal assistance to seven counties nearly two weeks ago. “This federal disaster declaration will help provide assistance for Western North Carolina communities to rebuild stronger and smarter, and I appreciate the president’s approval of our request,” Cooper said in a statement. The storm claimed the lives of six people in Haywood County, caused major damage to more than 200 homes and led to nearly $19 million in estimated damages to public infrastructure. The Cruso community was among those hardest-hit by the flooding. Wednesday’s approval from Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency frees up money to residents of Buncombe, Haywood and Transylvania counties. State, tribal and eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations also qualify for federal funds on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work performed in the three areas, as well as Avery, Madison, Watauga and Yancey counties.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State health officials took to an internet town hall Tuesday to promote certain treatments for COVID-19 and discourage use of an anti-parasitic medicine. Ivermectin has a limited scope for human treatment, sometimes prescribed for worms, scabies and head lice. It is more popular in veterinary form as a treatment for parasitic infections and infestations in cows and horses. North Dakota health officials say data on ivermectin sickness is limited, and poison control has only documented a couple of such cases. But Dr. Joshua Ranum of West River Regional Medical Center said the stories are out there. “The ivermectin issue is interesting,” Ranum said. “We of course live out in farm and ranch country. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that the cows didn’t get their full dose of ivermectin because some of it accidentally went down the hatch.” The veterinary form of ivermectin has high concentrations of the drug because of the high body mass of horses and cows. Adverse effects in humans include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma and death. There are better and safer options, according to Ranum and state Health Department spokesman Kirby Kruger. They pointed to monoclonal antibody drugs, steroids and antivirals like remdesivir.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers plan to unveil their version of a newly drawn map of legislative districts Thursday morning, with a vote planned later in the day on a final version, the state Senate president said. The Ohio Redistricting Commission, charged with drawing a map good for as long as 10 years, missed its Sept. 1 deadline, triggering an extension until the middle of the month. Senate Democrats submitted their proposed map last week. The map to be presented Thursday morning was created by House and Senate Republicans, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. Some of the GOP map is almost identical to the Senate Democrats’ version, he said. The commission will vote on a final version of its proposed map Thursday afternoon, Huffman said. The commission held nine public hearings around the state earlier this month looking for input on a new map, which is meant to end the current gerrymandered maps. Voters approved constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018 that created a new process for drawing both state legislative and congressional district maps this year and set up the independent commission. Creating a 10-year map requires a majority vote of the commission, including both Democrats. Creating a four-year map requires a simple majority without both Democrats.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has removed the only two physicians from the board that oversees the state’s Medicaid agency, just a week after the board voted 7-1 to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to privatize some Medicaid services. Dr. Jean Hausheer said Tuesday that both she and Dr. Laura Shamblin, an Oklahoma City pediatrician, were informed Saturday by a staffer in the governor’s office that they were being removed from the governing board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Hausheer, an ophthalmologist from Lawton, said neither she nor Shamblin was told why they were being removed, and Stitt spokeswoman Carly Atchison didn’t immediately respond to questions about his decision. “The governor has my cellphone number … it is kind of odd that he didn’t contact me himself,” Hausheer said. “I’m going to presume it was because of our last board meeting.” Hausheer and Shamblin were among seven members of the board who voted last week to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to outsource case management for some Medicaid recipients to private insurance companies. Stitt’s managed care proposal has faced bipartisan opposition in the Legislature and was ruled unconstitutional in June by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Because of new guidance, city officials may need to exempt the police bureau from an order that all employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk losing their jobs. The city attorney’s office said Tuesday that the order requiring police to be inoculated is now legally dubious because of new guidance from the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Under state law, local municipalities can only issue vaccine mandates for police officers if a federal or state rule requires it. The city believed Gov. Kate Brown’s vaccination mandate issued last month for state health care workers covered officers because they receive some medical training. But the new guidance related to Brown’s vaccine mandate said law enforcement was “probably not” subject to the governor’s orders, as providing medical care was “likely not a fundamental part of their job.” The city’s police union previously said a vaccine requirement would lead to mass resignations. The Portland Police Bureau has said it does not track vaccination rates for its officers. The city as of Tuesday had not publicly announced any change in policy regarding the vaccination mandate. Multnomah County, like Portland, has ordered all employees to be vaccinated by Oct. 18, including the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A statewide mask mandate for schools went into effect Tuesday, with some districts in open defiance of the Wolf administration, while GOP leaders in the state House planned to come back to Harrisburg early to mount a legislative response. The state health secretary’s order that students, staff and visitors at K-12 schools and child care facilities are required to wear masks while indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, has provoked outrage from some parents, students and school board members who say the decision should remain local. Some districts faced anti-mask protests as students returned to class after the long Labor Day weekend. Meanwhile, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County flouted the mask mandate by voting to keep face coverings optional. The superintendent of Hamburg Area School District in Berks County said masks would remain optional pending the outcome of a special school board meeting to discuss the statewide mandate. Late Tuesday, the board voted 5-3 to adhere to the Department of Health order and require masks, WFMZ reports. In central Pennsylvania, the Central York School Board expressed disdain for the mask mandate and said it would give a “grace period” for students to come into compliance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Local police organizations are questioning Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s judgment after he hired a civilian with no experience in law enforcement to be the city’s first-ever police major instead of considering the Black officers who applied for the position. Elorza chose Michael Stephens, who has no experience in law enforcement, aside from graduating from the citizens academy in 2016. Stephens was a recreation director and NCAA referee before his appointment as police major, The Boston Globe reports. The National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers Chairman Charles Wilson said the mayor’s decision in appointing a civilian without experience over qualified Black law enforcement officers was demeaning. Stephens is also Black. Stephens will manage oversight on police training and be responsible for the recruitment and training of police recruits. According to Wilson, three Black officers applied for the major’s position. The mayor chose Elorza instead. Providence City Council President John Igliozzi proposed that the mayor change the job title from police major to public safety community-police liaison because of the backlash from the police organizations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Authorities shut down a road for more than an hour Tuesday to investigate a bomb threat that turned out to be a wedding dress, Charleston Police said. Someone who saw a woman cram an oversized package into a mailbox called 911, Charleston Police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. Officers responded and determined the package contained a wedding dress that a woman was trying to return by mail, Francis said. The road was reopened after more than an hour. The statement did not say if the wedding dress was damaged.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has capped the number of retail stores that can sell medical marijuana at five. The council signed off Tuesday night on a proposal coming from Mayor Paul TenHaken’s office. But council members halved the $100,000 license fee that City Hall wanted and will allow the licenses to be sold on the secondary market. “The Sioux Falls City Council, by making a license worth $50,000 and transferrable, has just made dispensary licenses into liquor licenses,” Drew Duncan, a Sioux Falls attorney and lobbyist for clients in South Dakota’s gambling and alcohol industry, said via social media following the 7-1 vote. A new liquor license in Sioux Falls costs about $200,000, but a state-set cap on the number of them has driven up the price on the secondary market to $300,000 or higher. TenHaken and supporters of barring the transfer of dispensary licenses worry that allowing them to be sold on the secondary market will give them an artificial value, just as has happened with liquor licenses. But the majority of the council decided without allowing a license to be owned outright, the city’s medical marijuana rules would unduly restrict a retailer’s ability to grow their business.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel has approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle Corp. as the company plans to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to the fast-growing capital city over the coming decade. The State Funding Board’s approval of the FastTrack grant came during a meeting Tuesday. In April, Nashville Mayor John Cooper’s office announced that the Austin, Texas-based computer technology company plans to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet of office space. Documents show the jobs will have an average salary of $110,000. Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres and is offering $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park, the mayor’s office has said. Half of Oracle’s future property taxes – which the company estimates will be roughly $18 million annually when the project is fully built – would reimburse the company for the upfront investment, without interest payments, with the other half going into the city’s general operating fund, Cooper’s office has said. The move would surpass the expansion of Amazon, which in 2018 announced it would bring 5,000 jobs through a $230 million investment.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday defended a new state law banning most abortions that also does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, saying it does not force victims to give birth – even though it prohibits abortions before many women know they’re pregnant. Abbott, a Republican, said Texas would strive to “eliminate all rapists from the streets” while taking questions during his first press conference since the law took effect last week. The comments drew new criticism from opponents of the biggest curb on abortion in the U.S. since the medical procedure was legalized a half-century ago. The Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Though abortion providers in Texas say the law is unconstitutional, they say they are abiding by it. “His comments are confusing to me because they certainly do not seem to reflect the realities of this law,” said Amy Jones, the chief executive officer of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. Recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice found that most rapes go unreported to police. “Certainly it is in our mission statement to work to end sexual violence – that is why we exist – but we are also very aware that that is an aspirational goal that yes, we do believe that this is a preventable crime, but it if it were that easy, rape would no longer exist,” Jones said.\n\nUtah\n\nBrian Head: In the midst of record tourism statewide, Gov. Spencer Cox helped park staff and charity partners break ground Tuesday on a new visitor center at Cedar Breaks National Monument. The center has been a decade in the making, built with a combined $6 million in funds from fees, donations, and funding from Iron County, the National Park Service, the Zion Forever Project charity and organizations. Superintendent Kathleen Gondor did a “happy dance” as she opened the groundbreaking ceremony near the popular Point Supreme overlook, which is currently closed to the public because of the construction. “It’s just going to give us that sense of place instead of a bunch of pullouts along the road,” she said, echoing a sentiment that Cedar Breaks is a “drive-thru” park. Cox said there was “every right to be excited,” and he was glad to see partnerships work as visitation soars in the lesser-known park. “So many people even in Utah don’t know about it, still,” he said. “Americans are rediscovering America, and Utahns are rediscovering Utah.” But with increased visitors comes an increased responsibility to make sure those visitors have a good experience and recreate responsibly, something Cox said he hopes the visitor center will help people to do.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: Three state troopers who are accused of being involved in a scheme to create fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards have resigned, state police said Tuesday. Troopers Shawn Sommers and Raymond Witkowski resigned Aug. 10, a day after a fellow trooper told supervisors about the alleged scheme. Trooper David Pfindel resigned Sept. 3 following further investigation, according to a state police news release. The three ex-troopers are suspected of having varying roles in the making of fraudulent vaccination cards, according to the release. “The accusations in this case involve an extraordinary level of misconduct – a criminal violation of the law – and I could not be more upset and disappointed,” Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in the release. “If these allegations are proved to be true, it is reprehensible that state troopers would manipulate vaccination cards in the midst of a pandemic, when being vaccinated is one of the most important steps anyone can take to keep their community safe from COVID-19.” Sommers and Witkowski both joined the Vermont State Police in July 2016. Pfindel was hired in January 2014, police said. Federal authorities are investigating the allegations.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A part of southside Virginia that has relatively lower rates of vaccination against COVID-19 is seeing increasing interest in the shots. The Danville Register & Bee reports that it appears the most recent surge in infections has spurred more residents to roll up their sleeves in the Pittsylvania-Danville Health District. Data from the Virginia Department of Health shows that inoculations jumped about 50% in August compared to July. Nearly two-thirds of the almost 5,700 shots were first doses. “Numbers of vaccinations are increasing as of late, which we welcome and consider a positive step by the community,” Dr. Scott Spillmann, director of the local health district, told the newspaper. “We ask everyone who is not yet fully vaccinated to do so as soon as possible.” Southside Virginia trails the rest of the state when it comes to vaccination rates. As of Friday, 51% of adults in Danville were fully inoculated. In Pittsylvania County, 47% of adults were fully vaccinated. Statewide, more than two-thirds of adults have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series. Meanwhile, Danville and Pittsylvania County combined are seeing about 52 new coronavirus infections a day because of the delta variant.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: A recent increase in COVID-19 deaths has overwhelmed a southwest Washington county’s storage capacity, prompting the coroner to ask the commissioners to declare an emergency to allow the county to bring in a refrigeration trailer. Cowlitz County commissioners agreed Tuesday to the request to help expand capacity until the new morgue is ready for staff to move into in about a month. The Daily News reports Cowlitz County Health and Human Services data for the past week is incomplete, but at least eight county residents died due to COVID-19 between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6. The residents ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and seven of the residents had been hospitalized. Coroner Tim Davidson said the morgue and the county’s funeral homes are maxed out on capacity, and they are “being creative” to maintain cold storage. All together, the facilities can typically hold 45 bodies and right now have about 65, he said. “We’re just doing our best that we can to preserve the dignity of the deceased from this point forward until they can be processed for their families,” Davidson said. The morgue can hold 10 bodies but is currently “way above that,” using gurney tables in the cooling rooms to handle the increase, he said. The new morgue under construction will be able to hold 50 in cold storage.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: The state’s largest annual festival will require most people in attendance to wear masks when Bridge Day is held this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic in America’s newest national park. Tens of thousands of people typically show up on the third Saturday of October to watch parachutists, zip liners and rappellers on the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville. Masks will be required at the festival regardless of vaccination status, and social distancing must be observed whenever possible, the Bridge Day Commission said in a statement. People come from across the world to attend the event. Festivalgoers typically line the center of the 3,000-foot-long bridge shoulder-to-shoulder trying to get a good look at parachutists catapulting themselves off the nation’s third-highest bridge. Exceptions to the mask mandate include those at the time of their participation – be it in the air, during a 5-kilometer run, while rafting in the New River or on a zip line. But they’ll have to mask up before and after, the statement said. Social distancing will be next to impossible on the crowded bridge itself, but organizers said it will be required on the festival’s perimeters. Bridge Day is the only day of the year the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. The pandemic forced last year’s event to be canceled.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new report suggests people are buying dramatically more alcohol as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. Revenue from state excise taxes on alcohol during the fiscal year that ended June 30 totaled $73.8 million, up almost 17% from $63.3 million the previous year, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Revenue cited in the report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. If the preliminary data holds, the increase would be the biggest proportional increase the state has seen since 1972, the report said. The rise in alcohol tax collection exceeded 2.4% in only one year between 2009 and 2020, the report said. Alcohol excise taxes in Wisconsin are based on the volume sold, not price. Beer is taxed at about 6.5 cents per gallon. Wine is taxed at 25 cents per gallon if it has an alcohol content of 14% or less. The report did not examine sales tax revenue on alcohol. Most states have seen a bump in alcohol tax revenues during fiscal year 2021. The report said increased alcohol consumption is “perhaps unsurprising” given rising stress related to personal health, job losses, school challenges and a lack of leisure activities during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Michael K. Davis plans to retire in January, opening the way for Gov. Mark Gordon to make his first appointment to the high court. Davis plans to retire Jan. 16 after a decade on the state’s highest court, Chief Justice Kate M. Fox said in a statement Tuesday. Davis served as chief justice for three years, stepping down from that role July 1. He was a state district judge for four years before being named to the Supreme Court. He previously was an attorney in private practice. He graduated with honors from the University of Wyoming law school in 1980. Former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, named all five current justices over his two terms in office. Gordon, also a Republican, will choose the next justice from a list of three names submitted to him by the state Judicial Nominating Commission. The commission plans to accept expressions of interest from qualified people through Oct. 1. Wyoming requires Supreme Court justices to be at least 30, “learned in the law,” a judge or attorney for at least nine years, a U.S. citizen and a Wyoming resident for at least three years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}]}

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/wes-moore-baltimore-origin-story-campaign-governor-maryland/index.html", "title": "Wes Moore, a rising Democratic star, told his origin story. But did he ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWes Moore, a leading Democratic candidate for governor of Maryland, first became famous for his 2010 bestselling memoir, “The Other Wes Moore,” an inspirational story of two boys with the same name and ties to the rough streets of Baltimore.\n\nWhile the author became a Rhodes scholar, an Army captain and a White House fellow, the other Wes Moore was convicted of killing a police officer in 2000 and is serving a life sentence in prison.\n\nThe book is required reading in many schools in Maryland and across the country, and it fixed Moore in the minds of many as a proud son of Baltimore. It also helped launch his successful career in media and philanthropy. Moore has since written more books, hosted his own TV show on the Oprah Winfrey Network and spent four years as CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City’s largest anti-poverty non-profit.\n\nNow Moore is seen as a potential up-and-comer in Democratic politics. He’s one of the leading primary candidates in a state where the party’s nominee would be heavily favored to win the governor’s race – and, potentially, to rise as a national political figure.\n\nBut as he’s entered politics, Moore’s story has come in for a closer examination.\n\nWhile his book lays out the basic details of his life factually, a less accurate version of his Baltimore roots has taken on a life of its own, fueled by more than a decade of assertions by other people in TV interviews that he is a Baltimore native, born and raised in the city.\n\nAt times, Moore has fed that impression himself. For example, he has repeatedly said that he originally wanted to call his first book “Baltimore Sons.” Other times, he made ambiguous statements about his childhood connections to Baltimore or, in high-profile settings, sat by quietly as others repeated erroneous details.\n\nNow Moore’s story has become the subject of conversation in the race. His campaign last week sent a letter to the Maryland state prosecutor and the state board of elections, alleging that “false and disparaging information” had been spread about Moore in “an orchestrated attempt” to disparage him. The letter goes on to allege that “a rival campaign may be responsible for this smear campaign.”\n\nThe same week, the campaign launched a website, FactsMD.com about Moore’s childhood and connections to Baltimore.\n\nIn checking out those facts, CNN reviewed dozens of Moore’s public appearances and writings of the past 12 years, as well as other records. What that effort reveals is a complicated story of race, identity and the responsibility of public figures to control their own narrative.\n\nAccording to Moore’s website, he wasn’t born in Baltimore but in Washington, DC. As the book lays out, he spent his early childhood in the suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, some 30 miles from Baltimore. After his father’s sudden death when Moore was 3 years old, he then moved with his family to the Bronx, which at the time was beset by crime, drugs and poverty – much as Baltimore was in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLate in the summer before he turned 16, Moore’s mother moved to the middle-class enclave of Pasadena, in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County. But by then Moore was away at military school in Pennsylvania. Moore’s campaign says that when he would visit his mother as a kid, he would often go roller-skating and get his hair cut in Baltimore.\n\nIt wasn’t until he was a 20-year-old undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University that Moore first lived in Baltimore. Even then, as a student at Johns Hopkins, the world he inhabited while attending a prestigious private university was nothing like the notorious inner-city housing developments of Baltimore where the 2010 book says the other Wes Moore grew up.\n\nWes Moore's 2010 memoir was a bestseller and helped launch him into high-profile literary and media circles. One World\n\nThough Moore’s book never explicitly asserts he was born in Baltimore, it does allude prominently to his strong association with the city. The book opens with the line, “This is the story of two boys living in Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name.” Later in the same introduction, Moore writes, “We’d grown up at the same time, on the same streets, with the same name.”\n\nMore than one interviewer referred to Moore as born in Baltimore, including Winfrey. A spokesperson for Winfrey told CNN the producers of their 2016 interview had relied on information in the published memoir in crafting her introduction.\n\nNow that the campaign is underway, those closest to Moore describe a genuine connection to Baltimore, where he has lived for about the last decade.\n\n“I’ve never seen anyone connect to a place more than Wes did when he fell in love with Baltimore,” his mother, Joy Moore, said in a statement provided to CNN by the Moore campaign. “My job was in Baltimore City, and I couldn’t keep him out of the city when he was home from military school as a teenager.”\n\n“Baltimore is where Wes came of age,” she said, “and he has built and fostered a community in Baltimore for over 25 years since he was 15 years old.”\n\nIn response to questions from CNN, the Moore campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview and directed CNN instead to answers provided on the FactsMD.com website.\n\n“This attempt to put Wes Moore’s childhood trauma under a microscope neatly aligns with blatant dog whistles and other mischaracterizations of Wes’ childhood that have been circulating for months and that are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the State Prosecutor’s Office,” a Moore campaign spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN.\n\nContacted by CNN, the state prosecutor declined to comment.\n\nAsked about the Moore campaign’s complaint letter, Maryland Board of Elections director of candidacy Jared DeMarinis said, “We review every complaint, and this is no different from any other complaint we receive in the course of an election.”\n\nThe story morphs over time\n\nThe question of where Moore grew up has been complicated by more than a decade of public promotion and hype that has surrounded his up-from-the-streets story.\n\nWithin weeks of the 2010 publication of Moore’s first book, he was on The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and on a high-profile media book tour that took him through, among others, “The View,” “PBS NewsHour,” “Morning Joe” and “The Colbert Report.”\n\nMoore didn’t object when others asserted that he and the other Wes Moore were from the same part of Baltimore. In a May 2010 PBS interview, Moore walked under umbrellas in the rain with Judy Woodruff, telling her, “These were areas that we knew. These were blocks that we knew.”\n\nThey passed the intersection of Kennedy Avenue and The Alameda, which is about 25 miles from Moore’s mother’s house in Pasadena, and 1.8 miles from the Hopkins campus.\n\nWoodruff introduced him as “Baltimore native Wes Moore,” speaking from the studio to introduce the piece before cutting to footage of them walking down the street together in Baltimore.\n\nAsked about the segment, Woodruff told CNN she’d found the copy of “The Other Wes Moore” that she’d read ahead of the interview and had cited lines like that first sentence, “This is the story of two boys from Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name,” and a headline that is included from The Baltimore Sun, “Local Graduate Named Rhodes Scholar.” (Though not identified as such in the book, the article had run on the front page of the paper’s Anne Arundel County section in December 2000.)\n\nMany of Moore’s interviews featured the same anecdote of how he had first learned about the other Wes Moore: It was his junior year of college and he was studying abroad in South Africa when his mother called with surprising news. “‘There are wanted posters all over your neighborhood for Wes Moore, for the murder of a police officer,’” he said she had told him.\n\n“You were haunted by the fact that a guy with your name, grew up in the same neighborhood, a couple of blocks away, a lot of similarities, but you end up working in the White House, and he ends up in jail,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough responded, as Moore listened contentedly, making no correction.\n\nA month and a half later, on his old Comedy Central show, Stephen Colbert stopped Moore at one point in his storytelling.\n\n“This is your neighborhood back home?” Colbert asked.\n\n“Yeah. This is the same neighborhood,” Moore said.\n\n“Where was this neighborhood?” Colbert asked.\n\n“It was in Baltimore,” Moore said.\n\nThe Moore campaign declined to answer CNN’s questions about television appearances.\n\nMoore’s origin story drives his rise to celebrity\n\nThe runaway success of “The Other Wes Moore” launched Moore into an elite circuit of influence and paid appearances. He was a regular panelist on “Morning Joe” and HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher.” He was invited to give commencement speeches and was popular on the paid speaker circuit off a bio that introduced him as “raised in Baltimore.”\n\nWes Moore appears on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, March 18, 2012.

Plowman/NBC/Getty Images\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Moore was invited to the White House several times, and he received an Obama presidential appointment to a community service board.\n\nBy 2016, Moore was walking arm in arm with Winfrey in a video for her “Super Soul Sunday” series, talking about his second book, “The Work.” Winfrey introduces the segment with a series of voice-overs.\n\n“Born in Baltimore in 1978,” she starts.\n\n“He discovered there was another young man, also named Wes Moore, who grew up just blocks away from his own childhood home,” she says a few seconds later.\n\nThe next year Moore got a high-profile job in philanthropy. In April 2017, he was named CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a non-profit that raises hundreds of millions from New York’s investment bankers and hedge funders.\n\nRobin Hood sees itself as essentially New York’s community foundation, with all of its programming locally based. People familiar with the search process told CNN that Moore’s roots in the Bronx had helped land him the job. Indeed, the Robin Hood news release announcing his hiring notes that “he spent much of his childhood in the Bronx.” There’s no mention of being from Baltimore at all.\n\nSoon, in the official bios Moore was sending around as CEO for appearances from Princeton’s department of African American studies to the BlackRock investment firm, that shifted again: “Wes grew up in Baltimore and the Bronx,” it reads.\n\nThe brand becomes a campaign\n\nWhen news started spreading in the winter of 2021 that Moore was considering a run for governor, a February 2021 Baltimore Sun headline read, “Baltimore-born author and educator Wes Moore considering running for Maryland governor.”\n\nMoore left the Robin Hood Foundation last spring and announced his campaign for governor a few weeks later.\n\nAs he prepared to launch a political career, there are signs that efforts were made to correct the record. Last June, three days before he entered the race, Moore’s personal website was edited, with changes removing a reference to “back home in Baltimore.” That same day, a Wikipedia user changed Moore’s listed birthplace from Baltimore to Takoma Park, citing the change back to his personal website.\n\nIn his campaign launch video, a young actor plays Moore as a boy, at an age when he was living in the Bronx. Though the street featured in the shoot is not identified, the scene immediately cuts to the Baltimore skyline.\n\nIn the months since announcing his candidacy, Moore has gained traction despite competing in a crowded primary field.\n\nWes Moore opens his campaign office in Prince George's County on March 05, 2022 in Lanham, Maryland. Brian Stukes/Getty Images\n\nOn April 2, Moore overwhelmingly won the backing of the state teachers’ union, a major endorsement in the race. In his speech to members, he talked about how many classes he’d been to with students who had read his book and connected with his story. The Baltimore public school system placed an order for 4,600 copies of “The Other Wes Moore” in 2020 alone.\n\nAmong the defenses the Moore campaign includes on its FactsMD website is that Moore asked his publisher, Random House, for a correction ahead of the book’s publication and again as he was preparing his campaign. “Some versions of the book synopsis of THE OTHER WES MOORE inaccurately identified Wes Moore as born in Baltimore. Flagged by the author at the time, a correction to the copy was missed upon its initial publication,” a statement attributed to Random House on the website states. “When notified again of the error early last year, Random House corrected all subsequent print runs of the book.”\n\nThe publisher confirmed that statement but did not answer follow-up questions from CNN about it.\n\nIn his second book, “The Work,” published in 2015, Moore also referred to spending nights in Baltimore as a child. “As a kid in Baltimore and the Bronx during the homicidal height of the so-called crack era, I would lie in bed on some nights and listen to the pop of low-caliber guns somewhere beyond my window,” he wrote.\n\nThe Moore campaign declined to discuss specific questions about this memory or to make Moore available to talk about it.\n\nJust a few months before launching his campaign, in a video chat with members of his old college back at Oxford in January 2021, Moore sat quietly as two different professors introduced him by mentioning his Baltimore roots, one by saying, “born in Baltimore, well-known by anyone who’s seen ‘The Wire.’ “\n\nBaltimore as a backdrop\n\nFor some in Baltimore, it’s OK for suburban residents to claim the city as home.\n\nCarl Stokes, a former Baltimore city council member, said he had met Moore two decades ago after a college professor introduced them. They met for lunch at the Hopkins Club on campus, Stokes said, and Moore talked about his connections to the wider area back then.\n\n“It’s close enough that I don’t think it’s that unusual to say they’re from the next big place,” said Stokes, who is now supporting state comptroller Peter Franchot in the governor’s race.\n\n“If you dig deeper, they’ll say, ‘Actually, I was out from the suburbs,’ ” he said.\n\nBut other residents see it differently.\n\nHassan Giordano, a Baltimore native and Democratic political media consultant who is not backing a candidate in the governor’s race, said he’s known Moore for a decade and that he’s impressed with Moore’s other qualifications. But he called the account of Baltimore roots “really disingenuous.”\n\nAsked by CNN if he’d consider the time Moore cites during his teen summers as “coming of age” in Baltimore, Giordano said, “Hell, no.”\n\n“That’s not growing up in Baltimore, that’s visiting Baltimore. That’s being here for the summer,” Giordano told CNN.\n\n“I think that most people from Baltimore would tell you that it gets under their skin to hear someone say that they’re from Baltimore, even if they’re from Baltimore County or the Baltimore area,” Giordano said.\n\nMunir Bahar, a longtime community activist in Baltimore who told CNN he doesn’t have a favored candidate in the governor’s race, said that when he had first met Moore after the 2015 riots following the death of Freddie Gray, he had thought the candidate was from the city.\n\nWhen told by CNN that Moore’s campaign describes him as being raised in Baltimore based on his summers visiting from Pasadena, Bahar said, “That’s definitely not being raised in Baltimore. That’s not the Baltimore experience,” adding, “As a young Black boy growing up in Baltimore, you can’t use that as a platform unless it’s really authentic, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. Everybody wants to use Baltimore as a backdrop.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2020/03/13/coronavirus-wisconsin-latest-confirmed-cases-cancelations/5040483002/", "title": "Blog Recap: Coronavirus updates from around Wisconsin on Sunday", "text": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nUpdates on coronavirus and how it's affecting life in Wisconsin from reporters from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the USA Today Network-Wisconsin.\n\nUpdated Live Blog: Monday's coverage of coronavirus around Wisconsin\n\nRelated Coverage: What you need to know about coronavirus in Wisconsin\n\nMore Coverage: Coronavirus in the U.S. and around the world\n\nSUNDAY, MARCH 15\n\n9:50 p.m. Colectivo selling food and beverages only 'to-go'\n\nOne of metro Milwaukee's popular coffee cafes, Colectivo, is closing all of it's in-cafe seating areas and selling food and beverages only \"to-go\" starting Monday.\n\nTransactions for all take-out service will be cashless and touchless.

And she said many volunteers are older, higher-risk individuals.\n\nThe union said schools don't have adequate staffing to clean and disinfect their buildings and there have been shortages of soap, hand sanitizer, toilet paper and paper towels.\n\nSuperintendent Keith Posley said earlier in the week that the district had added additional staff to clean buildings.\n\nThe MTEA letter acknowledged that many students depend on the schools for regular meals and said schools would need to continue to provide those meals if closed.\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n1:53 p.m.: Giannis pledges $100,000 to Fiserv Forum workers\n\nOn Friday, Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo tweeted that he would pledge $100,000 to the Fiserv Forum staff, helping to offset costs related to loss of earning for hourly workers.\n\nIt's an identical amount pledged by Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love to the workers in his home arena.

He said Milwaukee County was taking immediate preventative to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\n“Our top priority is to keep Milwaukee County residents and visitors safe, and we will use every tool and resource at our disposal to ensure we continue our efforts to be the healthiest county in Wisconsin,” Abele said.\n\nAbele said the proclamation gives Milwaukee County the necessary tools to act quickly in response to the virus.\n\n“We will continue to monitor the situation and provide all resources necessary to respond,” said Director of the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management Christine Westrich. “We are partnering with the city and state to prepare and respond as the virus spreads and will continue to communicate fully with Milwaukee County residents as we move forward.”\n\nEffective immediately, two administrative orders are being implemented for Milwaukee County employees.\n\nA supplemental paid leave administrative order applies to all employees, and provides a separate bank of hours to use in response to COVID-19. All full-time, part-time, seasonal and hourly workers will be granted a minimum of 40 hours of SPL bank time to use.\n\nThe travel administrative order, which follows the recommendation of federal public health authorities, restricts out-of-state travel for Milwaukee County employees effective immediately. Any employee that is currently traveling or elects to travels out of state must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return, Abele said.\n\n“We continue to actively monitor the spread of COVID-19 closely while we work to ensure our public health response is in line with the seriousness of this virus,” said the Emergency Medical Services Medical Director for Milwaukee County Dr. Ben Weston. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are taking serious, necessary steps to ensure we are prepared to work efficiently and effectively if and when this is at our doorstep. This is not a time for panic, but rather for preparation.”\n\nMany county departments will cancel or reschedule upcoming public events and will continue to communicate these preventative measures on an ongoing basis, officials said.\n\nFor example, the Milwaukee County Department on Aging has postponed all social programming at Milwaukee-County owned senior centers and will continue providing congregate meal programming at these sites.\n\nMilwaukee County Transit has implemented an extra daily disinfecting process on all buses, in addition to the standard cleaning that vehicles receive on a regular basis, officials said.\n\nThe airport has instituted enhanced cleaning procedures and are following all guidance from the CDC and the Milwaukee Health Department.\n\nMilwaukee County Parks has posted information detailing the preventative actions recommended by the CDC have been posted throughout Park facilities, hand sanitizer is being made widely available, and frequent handwashing is encouraged.\n\nOfficials said the Milwaukee County Zoo is performing regular cleaning and disinfecting. There are additional alcohol-based hand sanitizers at the zoo, as well as additional sanitary wipes available in highly trafficked areas, officials said.\n\nUpdate: Waukesha County Executive Paul Farrow on Friday also declared a state of emergency.

Milwaukee teacher builds spreadsheet to connect those in need with helpers\n\nAngela Harris, a first grade teacher for Milwaukee Public Schools, created a Google form through which people can offer or request help for a variety of needs, as schools shut down and people become isolated.\n\nAnyone who fills out the form can offer to help with childcare, meal preparation and delivery, running errands, signing people up for health insurance, checking on more vulnerable people, mediating conflicts, transportation, emotional support and monetary donations. People can also make requests for help through the form.\n\nHarris said she was inspired to create the form by a friend in another city who’d done the same thing after a school district closed. Harris was worried about her own students given a potential shut down at MPS.\n\n“One of my biggest worries is about my students,” she said. “I’m just really concerned about where they’ll get their food and the things they need.”\n\nHarris created the form last night, went to work to teach this morning and recently saw more than 200 people have already responded, including several organizations offering to help her organize the inflow of responses.\n\nHarris said she’s planning to meet with these organizations in the coming days to collaborate and facilitate connections between those who’ve filled out the form.\n\n“This is way bigger than me and something I can’t do by myself,” she said. “I welcome the assistance and support.”\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\n11:13 a.m.: Breweries take steps to keep consumers safe\n\nBreweries are taking steps to make sure consumers are safe.

The updated Pfizer/BioNTech booster is authorized for people 12 and older, and Moderna’s is authorized for 18 and older.\n\nAt the same time, health officials stress the recommendation to get your seasonal flu vaccine. Some disease forecasters worry that the upcoming flu season could be a tough one for North America, as nations in the Southern Hemisphere that already had their flu seasons – like Australia and New Zealand – saw higher-than-average peaks in cases. So, the United States could see flu make a comeback while Covid-19 is still circulating at higher levels.\n\nBarring any new and concerning coronavirus variants, some officials predict that the updated Covid-19 shots could be the start of recommended boosters for Americans each year, similar to how updated annual flu vaccines are given.\n\n“For a majority of Americans, one shot a year will provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness, and that’s what we’ve got to be focused on,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN last week. “Maybe for some high-risk people – the elderly, the immunocompromised – they may need protection more than once a year, but for a majority of Americans, that’s where it is, and I think that’s a really good place to be.”\n\nWhere and when to get Covid-19 booster and flu shot\n\nThe updated Covid-19 vaccine booster and seasonal flu vaccines are available at most pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health care clinics.\n\nNot only are US health officials encouraging people to get both shots this year, some local public health departments are planning to schedule joint vaccine clinics, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“Jurisdictions are going to be standing up joint flu and Covid vaccine clinics and other opportunities for people to get both their flu vaccine and their Covid updated booster together,” Freeman said, adding that there is “no problem at all” with getting both shots at or around the same time.\n\nThe hope is for joint clinics to make it more convenient and accessible for people to get their vaccinations – but not everyone might be interested or even eligible to get both vaccines at the same time. Plus, some say it’s still early to get a flu shot.\n\nA single dose of the updated Covid-19 booster is recommended at least two months after the initial vaccine series or your most recent booster.\n\n“Now, suppose you’ve recovered from Covid – and many people of course have had Covid this summer – wait three months, at least,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nHe added that it’s important to get your booster as soon as you are eligible.\n\n“It’s clear that whether you’re vaccinated or you’ve had Covid, if you get this booster, you will get much higher levels of antibody and they are thought to help us get more prolonged protection,” he said. “The other thing that happens is that the immune system responds more broadly, and it looks as though we will get more broad coverage against other variants.”\n\nAs for the flu shot, the recommended timing of vaccination for this flu season is similar to last season, according to the CDC’s website.\n\n“For most people who need only one dose for the season, September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated,” according to the CDC, adding that while “ideally” it’s recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October, vaccination after October can still provide protection during the peak of flu season.\n\n“The ideal time is during the month of October and maybe the first couple of weeks of November – and the reason I say that is, particularly for older people and people who are frail, that will help their protection extend well through February into March, and that’s when flu often peaks in the United States in February,” Schaffner said. “Everyone ages 6 months and older should get influenza vaccine.”\n\nAs for children younger than 12, who are not eligible for the updated Covid-19 booster, Schaffner said parents should focus on getting their youngsters vaccinated with the primary series or booster they can get now.\n\n“I would say, maintain the current schedule,” he said. “Because it’s quite clear the original still does a good job in protecting us against hospitalizations and more severe disease.”\n\nSchaffner added that some people have asked him whether the Covid-19 vaccine protects against flu or vice versa. They do not.\n\n“You do have to get both vaccines,” he said. “The Covid vaccine will not protect against flu. The flu vaccine will not protect against Covid.”\n\nBracing for possible Covid-19 surge\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced its plan to manage Covid-19 this fall as there is the potential for an increase in infections, in part due to waning immunity from vaccines and infection.\n\n“Additionally, as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, contagious viruses like COVID-19 can spread more easily,” the announcement says. “And, as we saw last fall with the emergence of Omicron, we must continue to stay prepared for the possibility of a potential new variant of concern.”\n\nThe White House continues to call on Congress to pass additional funding for Covid-19 response, having asked for an updated $22.4 billion last week. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said that passing that funding would be “a very hard lift.”\n\nThe administration’s plan to manage Covid-19 this fall includes focusing on encouraging updated booster vaccinations and making them easy to access, as well as ensuring that people have easy access to at-home rapid tests and treatments. That includes the purchase of 100 million additional at-home rapid tests from domestic manufacturers, the White House said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services “will launch a paid media campaign aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on those over age 50, as well as Black, Hispanic, rural, Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native audiences through TV, radio, digital and print outlets.”\n\nThe administration is also boosting “easy access to Covid-19 testing and treatments” but warned, “While the lack of additional COVID-19 funding from Congress puts constraints on what we are able to do, the Administration will do everything in its power to ensure that tests and treatments remain widely available and easy to access, and will encourage Americans to use them.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/02/coronavirus-iowa-heres-whats-open-closed-across-state/5087821002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Iowa: Here's what's open, closed across the state", "text": "Iowans will soon be able to visit amusement parks, casinos and other outdoor venues under a new wave of reopenings announced by Gov.

Massage therapy and tattoo establishments also were allowed to reopen.\n\nSalons and barbershops must operate by appointment only and limit the number of customers to 50% of their establishment's legal occupancy, as well as keep all customers at least 6 feet apart from one another.\n\nAll salons, barbershops, massage therapy businesses and tattoo establishments must also take \"reasonable measures under the circumstances of each establishment\" to follow social distancing between employees and patrons and increased hygiene practices, the proclamation said.\n\nReligious gatherings\n\nSpiritual and religious gatherings of 10 or more are no longer restricted across the state, as of May 1. But churches, synagogues and other venues must use \"reasonable measures\" to ensure social distancing and increased hygiene are in place.\n\nWedding and funeral ceremonies are also not prohibited, although wedding receptions of more than 10 people are.\n\nReynolds has said that she would encourage places of worship to continue offering options for online services, especially for their most vulnerable parishioners.\n\n► \"God keeps us together\": Faith stays strong in the face of coronavirus\n\nFarmers' markets\n\nStarting May 1, Reynolds announced farmers' markets could begin operating in a limited fashion starting this week.\n\nThe markets can only include vendors selling farm products or food. Entertainment such as musical acts and children's activities remains prohibited. Organizers must also eliminate seating areas and keep at least 6 feet of space between all people and booths.\n\nNonessential surgeries and dental procedures\n\nReynolds banned nonessential surgical and dental procedures in a March 26 proclamation, partly to preserve personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. Reynolds has since lifted the ban on nonessential surgeries and dental services.\n\nHospitals and medical facilities providing nonessential surgeries must have an adequate inventory of personal protective equipment without relying on government stockpiles, as well as have a plan to preserve the equipment. All patients must undergo COVID-19 testing prior to the procedure.\n\nTo provide nonessential surgeries, medical providers also must not cease treating COVID-19 patients and must reserve a minimum of 30% of their intensive care unit beds and medical or surgical beds for such patients.\n\nDentists must comply with guidelines adopted by the Iowa Dental Board, which include mandatory screenings for all staff and patients. Iowa Dental Board investigators will enforce the requirements. Dentists also must have enough personal protective equipment without relying on government stockpiles, as well as a plan to conserve that equipment.\n\nGrocery stores, discount stores, pharmacies\n\nWhile Reynolds' orders initially closed many \"nonessential\" retail stores, they included an exemption for discount stores, grocery stores and pharmacies that also sell food, medicine and household goods. Stores such as Walmart and Target have also remained open.\n\nRestaurants' dining areas\n\nAt the beginning of May, Reynolds allowed restaurant dining rooms to reopen in 77 Iowa counties.\n\nReynolds extended those guidelines to all 99 counties on May 15. Restaurants can reopen at 50% of their normal capacity. As in the other 77 counties, all tables must be at least 6 feet apart, and buffets or other self-serve options are not allowed.\n\nStarting Thursday, parties of up to 10 people will be allowed in both restaurants and bars, up from the previous limit of six people.\n\n► Who's open? Which Des Moines' restaurants are open for dine-in or offering carryout.\n\nWedding reception venues\n\nWhile wedding ceremonies of more than 10 people have been allowed since early May, receptions remained prohibited until Friday, May 22.\n\nWedding receptions can now occur, provided the venue follows similar requirements to restaurants.\n\nThose requirements include following increased hygiene practices, keeping crowds at 50% of normal capacity, keeping all tables at least 6 feet apart and allowing no more than 10 people to sit at a table. Buffets or other self-serve options are not allowed.\n\nParks, golf courses and campgrounds\n\nIowa's state parks have remained open throughout the public health emergency, although some of the facilities have remained closed.\n\nIn a declaration that went into effect May 8, Reynolds allowed campgrounds across the state to reopen. The DNR is limiting the number of occupants per campsite at state campgrounds to six, unless an immediate family is larger than that. Visitors are not allowed.\n\nThe DNR will additionally open modern restrooms, shower buildings and cabins on Friday at state parks.\n\nDes Moines' municipal golf courses also remain open, although staff members are practicing social distancing guidelines.\n\nSocial clubs at golf courses can also reopen but must remain at or under 50% capacity, allow no groups larger than 10 people, ensure at least 6 feet of social distancing between groups and not allow self-service of food.\n\nDrive-in theaters, tanning facilities and medical spas\n\nDrive-in theaters were allowed to reopen prior to movie theaters. To reopen, all cars must remain parked at least 6 feet apart.\n\nTanning facilities and medical spas may also reopen if they implement “reasonable measures under the circumstances” to ensure social distancing and increase hygiene practices. Medical spas provide aesthetic medical services, such as laser hair removal, acupuncture and Botox injections.\n\nMedical spas are required to follow the same guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment issued to outpatient medical providers.\n\nFitness centers, health clubs and gyms\n\nReynolds has gradually phased in the reopening of fitness centers, health clubs and gyms.\n\nThe businesses can reopen at 50% capacity. All equipment must be spaced at least 6 feet apart, and group activities must be limited to 10 people or fewer.\n\nLibraries and race tracks\n\nA speedway or race track, including one conducting horse or dog races, may reopen provided it doesn’t permit any spectators to attend events in person.\n\nLibraries can reopen at 50% capacity.\n\nOther retail\n\nMany \"nonessential\" retail establishments — including bookstores; clothing and shoe stores; jewelry stores; luggage stores; cosmetic, perfume and beauty supply stores; furniture stores; florists; and home furnishing stores — reopened at 50% capacity on May 1 in 77 of Iowa's counties. Starting May 8, they reopened in all 99 counties.\n\nStores must also follow social distancing guidelines and increased hygiene practices.\n\nMalls\n\nEnclosed malls may reopen at 50% capacity, although play areas and seating areas, including food courts, must remain closed. Restaurants in the food courts can provide carry-out.\n\nCLOSED STATEWIDE:\n\nSwimming pools, adult day facilities\n\nSwimming facilities remain ordered closed with the exception of those opening for lap swimming and swimming lessons. The closure applies to all swimming pools and spas, wading pools, water slides, wave pools, splash pads and bath houses.\n\nAdult day care facilities and senior citizen centers also remain closed.\n\nIndoor performance venues, indoor playgrounds\n\nWhile Reynolds will allow outdoor performance venues to reopen starting Monday, indoor theaters and performance venues that hold live performances will continue to be closed.\n\nIn a similar fashion, outdoor playgrounds can reopen but indoor playgrounds or children's play centers must remain closed. That stipulation does not apply to playgrounds at private residences or at child care facilities.\n\nIan Richardson covers the Iowa Statehouse for the Register.

Brennand did not respond to requests for comment from CNN prior to his arrest. It was not clear Tuesday night whether he had an attorney.\n\nThe chief said an aggravated assault charge was filed for each person who was in the car – the driver and a passenger.\n\nThe shooting itself “was unjustified, both administratively and criminally,” McManus said. “There was a criminal component to this, that’s why we investigated as a criminal offense.”\n\nThe police department has been in contact with the district attorney’s office, which may need more information before it takes the case to the grand jury, the chief noted.\n\n“We worked on this for several days to get to this point where we could submit a warrant to a judge for signature, and that’s where we are right now,” McManus added.\n\n‘The video was horrific’\n\nMcManus has said it was clear from the beginning that the shooting was “not justified.” He previously said that the aggravated assault charges could rise to homicide if the 17-year-old does not survive.\n\n“The video was horrific,” the chief previously told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “There is no question in anybody’s mind looking at that video that the shooting is not justified.”\n\nMcManus said he recognized an issue immediately upon arriving to the scene of the shooting, based on the location of the bullet holes.\n\n“We have a policy that prohibits officers from shooting at vehicles, moving vehicles, except if their life is in immediate – their life or someone else’s life – is in immediate danger,” he said.\n\n“When I saw it, the location of the bullet holes, I had an issue with it right away. You can tell by looking at the vehicles, which way the vehicle is moving when the shots are fired, and this vehicle, it was very telling to me, that this vehicle was moving away from the officer, and moving parallel with the officer, so it was pretty clear to me at that point that we were going to have an issue,” McManus said.\n\nThe announcement of charges come a week after Brennand, a probationary officer with seven months of experience, shot Erik Cantu as the teenager sat in his car eating fast food.\n\nAccording to police, Brennand was handling an unrelated disturbance call at the McDonald’s when he saw a car he believed had evaded police the previous day and called for backup.\n\nBefore backup officers arrived, body camera video released by police shows the officer walk up to the driver’s side of the car, open the door, and order the driver out. The visibly startled teen, who was in the driver’s seat eating, put the car in reverse and started backing up.\n\nThe police officer then opened fire five times on the car, according to the video. As the driver shifted the vehicle to move forward, body camera video showed the officer opening fire an additional five times as the car drove away.\n\nCantu was shot multiple times and is in critical condition and on a life support system, his family said Monday. A passenger in the vehicle was unhurt.\n\n‘A failure for one individual police officer’\n\nWhen asked about the officers’ training on Tuesday, McManus stressed that what happened goes against the department’s policies.\n\n“This was a was a failure for one individual police officer had nothing to do with our policies. Policies did not allow that or training did not did not teach that. So this was a fail for one particular police officer,” the chief said.\n\nPolice said earlier that Brennand was fired for violating the agency’s tactics, training and procedures. “It took us a couple of days to terminate Brennand, but he was gone pretty quickly,” McManus told CNN.\n\nSAPD’s deadly force policy is explicit: “An officer in the path of an approaching vehicle shall attempt to move to a position of safety rather than discharging a firearm at the vehicle or any of the occupants of the vehicle.”\n\nThe policy further states that “officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle.”\n\nWhile in the hospital, Cantu was initially charged with evading detention in a vehicle and assaulting the officer, who had claimed he was struck by the door of the car as the teen backed up.\n\nHowever, his defense attorney Brian Powers said the Bexar County District Attorney’s Office notified him prosecutors would not be moving forward with charges. A spokesperson for the District Attorney’s office referred CNN to the county’s online court record system, which indicates both charges have been dismissed and the case closed.\n\n“While Sunday’s shooting of an unarmed teenager by a then-San Antonio Police officer remains under investigation, the facts and evidence we have received so far led us to reject the charges against Erik Cantu for further investigation,” District Attorney Joe Gonzales’ office said in a statement last week.\n\n“Once SAPD completes its investigation into the actions of former Officer James Brennand and submits the case to our office, our Civil Rights Division will fully review the filing. As we do with all officer-involved shootings that result in death or serious injury, we will submit the case to a Grand Jury for their consideration. Until that happens, we can make no further comment on this matter.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Josh Campbell Andy Rose", "Eric Levenson", "Josh Campbell", "Andy Rose"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/polio-cdc-rockland-county/index.html", "title": "'Silent' spread of polio in New York drives CDC to consider ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA polio case identified in New York last month is “just the very, very tip of the iceberg” and an indication there “must be several hundred cases in the community circulating,” a senior official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe case was found In Rockland County, which has a stunningly low polio vaccination rate. Dr. José Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, noted that the majority of people with polio don’t have symptoms and so can spread the virus without knowing it.\n\n“There are a number of individuals in the community that have been infected with poliovirus. They are shedding the virus,” he said. “The spread is always a possibility because the spread is going to be silent.”\n\nA team of CDC disease detectives traveled last week from agency headquarters in Atlanta to Rockland County, and they are “quite nervous” that polio “could mushroom out of control very quickly and we could have a crisis on our hands,” said a community health leader who has met with the team.\n\n“They are – what is the opposite of cautiously optimistic?” said another community leader, an expert in vaccine education, who has also met with the CDC team in Rockland County. Both leaders requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPolio can cause incurable paralysis and death, but most people in the US are protected, thanks to vaccination. Others, however, may be vulnerable to the virus for a variety of reasons.\n\nUnvaccinated and undervaccinated people are vulnerable, and polio vaccination rates in Rockland County and neighboring Orange County, just north of New York City, are about 60%, compared with 93% nationwide, by age 2. Immune-compromised people can be vulnerable even if they are fully vaccinated.\n\nRomero said the CDC is considering a variety of options to protect people from polio, including offering children in the area an extra shot of the vaccine, as UK health authorities are doing now in London, or recommending extra doses to certain groups of adults.\n\n“We’re looking into all aspects of how to deal with this. At this point, we don’t have a definitive answer,” he said.\n\nA ‘silent killer’\n\nThe Rockland County polio case is the first identified in the United States in nearly a decade.\n\nThe virus has also been detected in sewage in Rockland County and neighboring Orange County. The positive samples were genetically linked to the individual case, but no other cases in the US have been reported.\n\nAbout 3 in 4 people infected with polio don’t have symptoms, but they’re still capable of spreading the virus to others, according to the CDC. Among the rest, most have symptoms such as a sore throat or headache that could easily be overlooked or confused with other illnesses. Only a relatively small number, about 1 in 200 infected people, become paralyzed. A few of those who are paralyzed die because they can’t breathe.\n\nIn the late 1940s, polio outbreaks disabled an average of more than 35,000 people a year in the US. A vaccination campaign started in 1955, and cases quickly plummeted. Today, a full round of childhood polio vaccinations – four doses between 2 months old and 6 years old – is at least 99% effective, according to the CDC.\n\nBut in recent decades, some small groups have not vaccinated their children against the virus. One of them is within the ultraorthodox Jewish community in New York, including in Rockland County.\n\nMuch of the rest of the religious Jewish community in Rockland County has rallied around efforts to educate the “outliers” who refuse to vaccinate, the community health leader said.\n\n“This is a silent killer, like carbon monoxide, and we don’t know when it will hit us,” she said.\n\n‘A press release is not going to cut it’\n\nThe vaccine educator said the CDC team has been intent on learning the best ways to communicate with members of this community, who tend not to use the internet and instead get a lot of their information from the messaging platform WhatsApp as well as community newspapers.\n\nThis week, Rockland County and local health-care providers distributed an infographic in several languages, including Yiddish, that announced, “Polio is spreading in Rockland County.”\n\nThe vaccine educator in Rockland County said that at the meetings with the CDC team, “we spoke about the need for messaging that resonates, and a press release is not going to cut it.”\n\nDr. Mary Leahy, CEO of the largest health-care provider in Rockland County, Bon Secours Charity Health System, a member of WMCHealth, has attended meetings with the CDC and said that to get people who are not vaccinating their children against polio to understand the severity of the disease, “I turn to the grandparents and the great-grandparents who actually lived through the days of polio in the ’40s and ‘50s.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat makes sense to Romero.\n\n“I grew up in Mexico. I saw this disease, the complications,” he said. “I went to school with children that had braces.”\n\nHe said many Americans don’t recognize the “devastating” effects of “lifelong paralysis” from polio.\n\n“I think most of the American public has never seen a case of polio. People have lost that fear, if you will, of the disease.”", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/18/michigan-public-health-order-indoor-dining-theaters-casinos-whitmer/3956213001/", "title": "Michigan indoor dining ban extends to Jan. 15; other venues may ...", "text": "Michigan's casinos, movie theaters, bowling alleys and similar venues will be allowed to reopen on Monday, with some restrictions in place, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Friday. High schools also will be allowed to resume in-person classes next week, she said.\n\nBut indoor dining will remain banned, at least through Jan. 15.\n\nThe changes amount to rolling back some, but not all, restrictions implemented through controversial emergency orders aimed at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. State health department orders banning in-person classes, indoor dining and many business operations were implemented in November and extended earlier this month, but were set to expire Sunday. The new order was announced Friday but takes effect Monday.\n\n“We have made great progress, but that progress is precarious,” said Robert Gordon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “Many countries and states have achieved gains like ours only to lose them. Our hospitals are still near capacity, 100 people are losing their lives to COVID each day.\n\n“But if we stay on our current path, if we follow the science, and if we all do our parts, we will continue to save lives.

These venues are not allowed to operate concessions; Gordon and others have said the necessity to remove a mask in order to eat makes the activity too risky to do inside around others.\n\nNo venue can have more than 100 people in the same space unless it is a stadium or arena holding a non-contact sporting event. These venues can have up to 250 people, the order states.\n\nGathering restrictions at retail establishments remain in effect: stores can't exceed 30% capacity. Gyms, pools and ice rinks may open, but they must also follow guidelines that limit the number of people allowed inside.\n\nGyms and other exercise facilities cannot operate above 25% capacity, and all workout stations must be at least 12 feet apart. Group classes are not allowed.\n\nIndoor ice and roller rinks are allowed to operate, but only for individual workouts or one-on-one training, according to the order.\n\nState Senate Republicans criticized the governor for extending the indoor dining ban.\n\n\"We'll get through COVID-19, thanks to improving treatments, people taking personal responsibility and the wonder of vaccines. But there are no treatments to cure lost jobs and no vaccines for bankruptcies,\" tweeted Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake.\n\nSen. Aric Nesbitt, R-Lawton, is the chairman of a Senate committee focused on the state government's fight against COVID-19. He's already called for Gordon's resignation; on Friday, he again took the governor to task on Twitter.\n\n\"Since COVID arrived restaurants have adopted protocols and invested to make their businesses safe. Yet the owners and employees of Michigan restaurants will now spend their holidays out of work and uncertain about their futures. They deserve much better from (Whitmer),\" Nesbitt tweeted.\n\nRestaurant industry reacts to Whitmer order\n\nBefore being laid off in November, when the temporary pause went into effect, Alexandra Martin was the wine director and sommelier at Highlands, a swanky new steakhouse atop the Detroit Renaissance Center.\n\n“For me it’s a mixed bag,” she said of the extension. “Working in the service industry especially when we were still open at the beginning of November, it was very scary to serve guests in that manner. People were coming in in flocks and we were extremely busy — and staying safe while maintaining that level of business was definitely challenging.”\n\nBut without income, the situation for Martin has grown dire. She said she took a few odd jobs over the summer that have complicated her unemployment filing and she hasn’t been able to receive any support.\n\n“I haven’t been able to afford food to eat, let alone paying for things like rent,” she said. “I’m many months behind on my car payment.”\n\nNya Marshall, proprietor of the 11-month old Ivy Kitchen and Cocktails on Detroit’s east side, said she was devastated to hear the news that the indoor dining ban had been extended. She said she already had to lay off workers around Thanksgiving and would likely need to do so again.\n\nExasperated, Marshall said she felt like the restaurant industry was being unfairly singled out, noting crowds at local retailers with little visible enforcement of precautions.\n\n“I place the blame on the people that are making the rules,” she said. “I understand the rules. These are safety precautions. At Ivy and at probably 95% of the restaurants, everyone is following the rules. We understand COVID is real. We understand the rules and enforcement. But when you come out with these mandates and don’t put resources behind it, especially when you know what’s going on — we are literally about to close our doors down. We’ve toughed it out as much as we can.”\n\nGordon and other state officials have said eating and drinking indoors puts people at a higher risk of contracting the virus than many other activities. Whitmer and the health department stressed restaurants can remain open for carryout and delivery orders.\n\nGOP lawmakers and trade groups have criticized the orders as executive overreach doing harm to restaurants and other shops trying to survive. Lawmakers have also criticized banning in-person classes for high schools, arguing children are being harmed by not being physically in schools.\n\nHealth officials have repeatedly pointed to state outbreak data that shows high schools as the source of more than 100 ongoing or new outbreaks. Earlier this month, health organizations, including hospitals across the state, called on Whitmer to extend the order beyond its original three-week duration, pointing to infection and death rates that remain high.\n\nMore than 450,000 Michigan residents have contracted COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, with roughly 11,200 dying from the disease, according to state health officials.\n\nThe health department originally instituted the restrictions effective Nov. 18. They were set to expire Dec. 9, but the state extended the orders through 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nMore:Michigan House passes bills aimed at limiting Whitmer's power\n\nThe vaccine and what comes next\n\nWhitmer and her supporters note the pandemic, not her orders, are to blame for the economic collapse experienced across the country. Opponents argue businesses can operate safely, but Whitmer and health officials point to increases in cases and deaths during times when orders are not in effect.\n\nA state restaurant association sued the state in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to overturn the orders. Several Catholic schools also sued the state, as reported by Bridge Michigan and others, arguing policies that required all high schools to close amounted to restrictions on religious liberties.\n\nThe governor has called on the state Legislature to pass $100 million in state relief, money that would go to workers and businesses affected by the pandemic. While legislative leaders are generally supportive of helping workers and businesses, a spokesman for House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, said early Friday the negotiations on specific details of any plan are ongoing.\n\nSenate Republicans announced the broad parameters of a plan Thursday evening. The news release did not include specific dollar amounts and repeatedly criticized the governor for her orders; that's a sign the proposal lacks administrative buy-in.\n\n\"There is a desire all around to reach a deal on the $100 million relief bill, to provide support to the families and small businesses that have been hit hardest by the pandemic,\" Whitmer said Friday.\n\n\"I’m hopeful that our leaders in the Legislature will join forces with me to get this completed, so we can get some much needed support for Michiganders. The strength of our state is depending on all of us working together to ensure support for our families and front line small businesses.\"\n\nThe news comes as the state works to distribute doses of the Pfizer vaccine to as many front-line health care workers as possible. More than 58,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine had arrived at hospitals and health departments as of Wednesday. The company has promised to deliver 84,825 to Michigan this week.\n\nAt least 2,000 health care workers around the state had already gotten a shot in the arm with Pfizer’s newly approved coronavirus vaccine as of Thursday. But the state announced Thursday it would receive about 24,000 fewer doses than previously promised in its next shipment. Health officials didn't have an explanation for why.\n\n\"The bottleneck appears to be the White House,\" Whitmer said, blasting the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Where are our doses? What is holding them up? When can we expect them? I'm angry because this virus is raging on in this country, and there is either corruption or ineptitude that is keeping us from saving lives.\"\n\nFor its part, Pfizer has said it successfully shipped all the doses the federal government instructed it to send.\n\n\"We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses,\" the company said in statement issued Thursday.\n\nMassachusetts-based biotech company Moderna also is on the cusp of getting federal approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. If that vaccine also is granted approval for emergency use, which could happen by Monday, it could increase the supply of vaccines to fight the pandemic.\n\nDr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, got a dose of the Pfizer vaccine during a Thursday night news conference at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, where she works as an emergency department physician.\n\n“We are now in a new era in fighting this virus,” Khaldun said during the news conference. “There is hope. And the end is near. Because of this vaccine, 2021 will be very different.\"\n\nMore:First COVID-19 vaccines leave Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo\n\nMore:Michigan health officials say state getting shorted on COVID-19 vaccine\n\nAlthough Whitmer instituted sweeping restrictions on gatherings and masks at the start of the pandemic, she eased some of them throughout the spring and early summer. However, she implemented new regulations in the early fall, pointing to rising case rates, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nIn October, the Michigan Supreme Court invalidated Whitmer's executive orders. It ruled one law she relied on was unconstitutional and another required she have legislative approval that she lacked.\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter, the health department issued orders under different state health laws that largely mirrored Whitmer's executive orders. After the court's order though, case rates and overall infections sharply increased. Whitmer has repeatedly pointed to what she has considered the confusion caused by the order as a factor contributing to the increasing number of cases and deaths.\n\nThe health department orders derive their power from a law passed in response to the flu epidemic of 1918 and are not affected by the court decision. However, state Republican lawmakers want to curtail that power in the future. The House and Senate have passed a bill that would require the director of the health department to receive legislative approval to issue an emergency pandemic order that would extend beyond 28 days.\n\nWhitmer is not expected to sign the bill, and lawmakers do not have enough votes to override any veto.\n\nContact Dave Boucher at dboucher@freepress.com or 313-938-4591.

Nearly the entire US population has at least some immunity through vaccination, previous infection or, in some cases, both.\n\n“The current conditions of this pandemic are very different from those of the last two years,” Greta Massetti, who leads the Field Epidemiology and Prevention Branch at the CDC, said Thursday.\n\n“High levels of population immunity due to vaccination and previous infection and the many available tools to protect the general population, and protect people at higher risk, allow us to focus on protecting people from serious illness from Covid-19.”\n\nThe new CDC guidelines say contact tracing, another hallmark during the pandemic, should be limited to hospitals and certain high-risk group-living situations such as nursing homes, and the guidelines de-emphasize the use of regular testing to screen for Covid-19, except in certain high-risk settings like nursing homes and prisons.\n\nThe new guidance also does not advise quarantining people who’ve been exposed to Covid-19 but are not infected.\n\nBut the guidance does keep some measures the same. It encourages testing for people with symptoms and their close contacts. It also says people who test positive should stay home for at least five days and wear a mask around others for 10 days. It also continues to recommend that people wear masks indoors in about half the country.\n\nThe new guidelines also tailor advice on isolation for people who became very sick from Covid-19. People with moderate symptoms – such as shortness of breath – and those who were hospitalized should stay home for at least 10 days. People with compromised immune systems should now talk to their doctor about ending their isolation after an infection.\n\nThere’s new advice on what to do if your Covid-19 symptoms rebound, too. If you end isolation and your Covid-19 symptoms get worse, you should start isolation over again and see your doctor.\n\nTrying to meet people where they are\n\nThe changes are an acknowledgment that SARS-CoV-2 may be with us for the long haul. They aim to help people live their lives around Covid-19 with minimal disruptions to work and school. They are also more risk-based, advising people who are at higher risk for severe illness to take more personal precautions than others.\n\n“I think they just overall come into alignment with what people are doing anyway,” says Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nChin-Hong thinks some states, like California, will continue to go beyond the CDC’s guidance in their own recommendations, but by and large, he thinks these reflect the prevailing attitudes toward the pandemic. He sees it as a move by the CDC to try to regain the public’s trust.\n\nA recent survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center shows that most Americans (54%) are no longer masking indoors, and about 4 in 10 say they’ve fully returned to their pre-pandemic routines – up from 16% in January.\n\n“What the CDC is, in my opinion, trying to do, they are trying to still be relevant, and maybe when they say something, people will listen to them instead of being completely 180 degrees away from what behavior is anyway,” Chin-Hong said.\n\nBill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that the new guidance shows that the CDC is trying to meet people where they are.\n\n“I think that this is a point where you actually have to sort of get real and start giving people tools they can use to do something or not. Because otherwise, people will just will not take you seriously,” Hanage said.\n\nOther experts, however, feel that the new guidelines don’t go far enough to correct scientific missteps in previous guidance.\n\n“This revision does not go anywhere near enough to correct the problems of flawed recommendations and lack of evidence,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, said in an email to CNN. Topol has been critical of the CDC for months, saying it wasn’t strict enough with its isolation policies for people with Covid.\n\nLatest advice to stay safe from Covid\n\nThe CDC recommends that Covid-19 prevention practices continue to depend on a person’s risk of becoming severely ill and on its Covid-19 community levels. Community levels reflect cases in a community as well as hospitalization rates and hospital capacity.\n\nWhen the Covid community level is high – as it currently is in 41% of counties – the CDC continues to recommend that everyone wear high-quality masks indoors. High-risk people should also wear quality masks when the community level is medium, as it now is in 39% of counties.\n\nThe agency also puts more emphasis on improving ventilation. Aerosol scientists have long complained that the 6-foot social distancing guidance was arbitrary and unhelpful because the virus that causes Covid-19 can float through the air for greater distances.\n\nThe CDC continues to stress the use of vaccines and therapeutics to reduce “medically significant illness” in Covid-19. For the general population, the agency noted that being vaccinated and boosted is highly protective against severe illness and death. It urges everyone to stay up to date on their shots.\n\nIn addition to vaccination, the CDC urges additional measures for people with suppressed immune function, including the use of Evusheld, a kind of passive immunity that’s given before a person gets sick. It’s especially helpful for people who can’t mount an immune response, and experts say it has been underutilized in this country.\n\nThe agency also stresses the use of antiviral medications in people who catch Covid-19 and are at higher risk for severe outcomes. This group includes people who are older or unvaccinated or those who have certain medical conditions that put them at higher risk. Conditions that increase risk include overweight and obesity, pregnancy, smoking, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and mental health conditions, including depression.\n\n“These recent changes recognize the importance of protecting those most at risk of severe illness, while also standardizing some basic good public health hygiene for the long-term for those less at risk,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“It’s important that we make it as easy as possible for people to continue to protect themselves and others around them as we live with Covid,” Freeman said in an email to CNN.\n\nCovid guidance for schools\n\nSome of the changes in the guidelines will apply to schools.\n\nThe agency removed the recommendation that kids in different classrooms avoid mixing, a practice known as cohorting. It also removed advice that kids who are contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid-19 take regular tests – and test negative – to remain in the classroom, which was known as test-to-stay.\n\nSome educators said they didn’t expect the updated CDC guidelines to change much, at least for this school year.\n\n“We welcome clear, concise and actionable guidance from the CDC. Specific to this latest round, we don’t expect it to be particularly disrupting or impactful in schools,” said Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director of advocacy and governance at AASA, The School Superintendents Association.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany districts have finalized their opening plans and mitigation strategies and are sticking to what worked the prior school year to keep kids in schools learning.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest teachers unions, said the new guidelines were welcome news for schools.\n\n“COVID-19 and other viruses are still with us, but with multiple prevention and treatment options available, now is not the time for new mandates. Instead, let’s ensure these tools are available and accessible: vaccines, testing and masks (and no stigma for those who mask),” Weingarten wrote in an email to CNN.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman Elizabeth Cohen", "Brenda Goodman", "Elizabeth Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/17/latest-iowa-coronavirus-covid-19-updates-outbreak-map-cancellations/5064551002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Iowa: A look back, March 16-22: Reynolds closes ...", "text": "Register staff\n\nState and federal officials say there are simple, everyday steps you can take to avoid catching or spreading respiratory diseases, including COVID-19: Cover your coughs and sneezes, thoroughly wash or sanitize your hands and stay home if you are sick.

Michael Wunn said.\n\nIn late May, the 133 Infantry Battalion out of eastern Iowa — also known as the Ironman Battalion — will deploy about 550 soldiers to Operation Spartan Shield in U.S. Central Command, located in the Middle East, Wunn said.\n\nComing from armories in seven communities — Charles City, Davenport, Dubuque, Iowa City, Iowa Falls, Oelwein and Waterloo — this deployment is expected to last a year. Their mission will still involve security and “force protection operations,” as a news release previously announced.\n\nIn June, two troops from the 113th Cavalry Regiment will deploy about 130 soldiers to Operation Enduring Freedom in U.S. Africa Command.\n\nAlso lasting a year, this deployment will include 90 soldiers from Le Mars, Iowa, and 40 from Johnson. These troops will help with “military operations, exercises and security cooperation activities on the African continent, its island nations and surrounding waters,” as a news release previously announced.\n\nFull-time staff members of the Iowa National Guard are following travel restrictions announced Monday by the Department of Defense, which limits military and personal travel to just “mission essential” or personal hardship trips, including funerals and family emergencies. Traditional guardsmen are not subject to the personal travel restrictions, but the Guard has significantly restricted training, conferences and any events that can be delayed or postponed.\n\n“This is a very fluid situation,” Wunn said, adding that they are making decisions every day based on recommendations from the Iowa Department of Public Health, the CDC and the Department of Defense.\n\n“We will protect the health of the force and make sure they are being taken care of while doing what we can to stop the spread,” Wunn said. “And we will balance that with our focus on mission readiness in case we need to support the Governor as well as the strict timeline our forces are on to prepare for deployment.”\n\nThe Iowa Gold Star Military Museum and the Wellness Center at Camp Dodge will be closed to the public by the end of the day Tuesday, though Camp Dodge will remain open, Wunn said.\n\nThe Guard is currently looking at events scheduled to take place at armories across the state and accessing next steps with organizers.\n\nReynolds prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people, closes theaters, casinos, restaurants, bars\n\nMarch 17: Iowa Gov.

But even as babies struggling to breathe fill hospital beds across the United States, there may be a light ahead: After decades of disappointment, four new RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the US Food and Drug Administration, and more than a dozen others are in testing.\n\nThere’s also hope around a promising long-acting injection designed to be given right after birth to protect infants from the virus for as long as six months. In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he’s “hopeful” there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n“As soon as he qualified, we were like ‘absolutely, we are in,’ ” Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health – the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand. A recent patient was in the back of her mind when she was signing up James for the study.\n\n“I took care of a baby who was only a few months older than him and had had nine days of fever and was just absolutely pitiful and puny,” she said. Brown said his family felt helpless. “And I was like, ‘this is why we’re doing it. This single patient is why we’re doing this.’ “\n\nEven before this year’s surge, RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the US. The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven’t had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n“Unfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,” said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n“The original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn’t understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‘oh no, this ain’t gonna work.’ And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n“It is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,” Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn’t communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins – essentially flattening them.\n\n“Now you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,” said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“Everything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,” said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that’s being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn’t work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn’t spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren’t later challenged with the live virus.\n\n“So of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they’re ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren’t early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,” Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH – some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines – reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus’s F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it’s in when it first enters the body – and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n“The companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,” said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. “And now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.”\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns – a group particularly vulnerable to the virus – via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen – the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson – relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that’s used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was “delighted” with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective – 94% – for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n“We are very pleased with these results,” Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving “with all due haste” to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n“We’re confident enough that we’ve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,” he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK’s trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen’s vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer’s vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a “game-changer.”\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they’ve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines – a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n“We’ve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,” Chu said. “So I think this is imminent.”\n\nWatching this year’s RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can’t come fast enough.\n\n“The hospital is surging. We’re not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they’re really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,” she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn’t have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it’s far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles.

Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that cross the placenta and protect the baby after birth.\n\n“The [study data monitoring committee] recommended, based on the data that we have, that we should go ahead and file, that this offers the potential for a safe and effective vaccine that could really dramatically help to prevent RSV during the winter season,” Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told CNN.\n\nIn the trial, the vaccine was given to pregnant people and appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in their infants in the first three months of life. It also cut a baby’s risk of needing to see a doctor for an RSV infection by half.\n\nPotential for first new product in decades\n\nIf approved, Pfizer’s inoculation will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades.\n\nIn March, the FDA designated Pfizer’s RSV vaccine a breakthrough therapy, a status that speeds its review.\n\n“That puts us in a very good position to essentially have something well in advance of next winter,” Gruber said, noting that both Pfizer and the FDA are conscious of the ongoing heavy RSV season in the US.\n\n“It will be up to them whether or not they can think of any other path that could allow this to come sooner,” he said.\n\nPfizer’s vaccine contains the virus’ F-protein, the site that it uses to attach to human cells. The protein is frozen into the shape it folds into before it fuses with a cell, so the immune system can build antibodies against it. Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is bivalent, containing F-proteins from both the A and B subgroups of the RSV virus, which are the two most commonly circulating strains.\n\nIn a study of 7,400 pregnant people and infants, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. It was about 70% effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized infants for six months.\n\nBabies were considered to have severe RSV if they were breathing very rapidly, over 70 breaths per minute in a 2-month-old; if their blood oxygen levels fell below 93%; if they required high-flow oxygen, or if they were admitted to the ICU; or if they lost consciousness.\n\nThe vaccine cut the need for infants to need to see a doctor because of RSV by an average of more than 50% compared with a placebo. That result did not fall within a statistical range that was specified by the FDA before the outset of the trial, however, so the company acknowledges that the vaccine missed that particular goalpost.\n\nGruber points out, however, that a 50% reduction in doctor visits due to RSV is still likely to be a noticeable and important benefit in the real world.\n\n“This is clearly sufficient and frankly, great news, for filing for our approval,” he said.\n\nPfizer also recently announced positive results in an ongoing trial of the same vaccine in older adults.\n\nLonger-term research\n\nThe drugmaker’s FDA filing would make it the first in a crowded field of companies developing vaccines against RSV. GSK had been testing a maternal vaccine but paused its study after learning of a safety problem.\n\nGSK said Monday that the trial remains stopped, though it did not share any details on the safety issue.\n\n“Further analysis to better understand safety data from these trials is ongoing,” spokesperson Alison Hunt said in a statement to CNN. “The relevant regulatory authorities and trial investigators have been informed. We’re committed to transparently sharing more data as we have it.”\n\nNo safety issues have been identified with Pfizer’s vaccine, Gruber said, and a panel of independent reviewers that looks over the study findings while the trial is progressing found no problems.\n\n“The vaccine is very tolerable, and no safety signals were identified,” he said, though the full results of the trial have not been published.\n\nAlthough Pfizer will suspend enrollment in the maternal vaccination trial, Gruber says it will continue to follow the infants who are enrolled.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We know that children that have RSV end up having compromised lung status, and they become more susceptible, in many instances, to other respiratory infections that puts them back in the hospital.

This is the first time updated Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the United States.\n\nBoth are bivalent vaccines that combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages.\n\nPfizer’s updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people age 12 and older. Moderna’s updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older.\n\nThe shots can be administered after they’re recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s vaccine advisory group is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation.\n\nAn OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days – both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven’t been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases.\n\nBooster shift\n\nThe updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive.\n\n“With today’s authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,” the FDA said.\n\nIndividuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule.\n\nPeople too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine.\n\nThe FDA said it will “work quickly” to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it’s working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\n“We want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that’s why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent – the original – booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series – and less than a third of the total population – has also gotten a booster.\n\nThere’s no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a “transitional year,” when people need to make sure they have a “good base upon which we build … which will help protect us against the unknown.”\n\n“If you’ve not yet received a booster dose, or it’s been several months since your last booster dose, now’s the time to consider getting one,” Marks said.\n\nOfficials defend swift authorization\n\nOn Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week.\n\n“The public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,” Marks said.\n\nThe agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it’s a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer.\n\n“We have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. “The FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.”\n\nIn addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1.\n\nHuman studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday. Data from those studies is expected in another month or two.\n\nVaccine milestone\n\n“America is the first country in the world that has authorized a bivalent vaccine where the bivalent vaccine targets the viruses out there,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who is leading the White House Covid-19 response, said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We try to do this every year for the flu. We almost never hit it on the mark. This has taken a lot of work by FDA. It’s been about leaning into the science, leaning into some very good modeling. And then really demanding from the companies that they produce vaccines that are going to be that are going to be matched.”\n\nThe Omicron BA.5 subvariant has dominated transmission in the United States for more than two months. Last week, it caused 89% – nearly 9 out of 10 – new Covid infections in this country, according to the latest estimates from the CDC.\n\nA recent offshoot of the BA.4 variant, BA.4.6, has slowly grown in prevalence to claim second place. Across the country, it caused about 8% of new infections last week, but it has taken off more in the Midwest – Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska – causing an estimated 17% of new infections there.", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas Brenda Goodman", "Naomi Thomas", "Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/health/fda-covid-vaccine-youngest-children-vrbpac-vote/index.html", "title": "FDA advisers vote in favor of authorizing Covid-19 vaccines for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously on Wednesday in favor of expanding the emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to include children as young as 6 months.\n\nAll 21 members of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted “yes” in response to the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine when administered as a 2-dose series (25 micrograms each dose) outweigh its risks for use in infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age?”\n\nAnd all the committee members voted yes in response to the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine when administered as a 3-dose series (3 micrograms each dose) outweigh its risks for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years of age?”\n\nThe FDA, which typically follows the committee’s decisions, will now decide whether to authorize the vaccines for emergency use in the youngest children.\n\nHowever, shots can’t be given until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own vaccine advisers have voted on whether to recommend them and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has signed off on the recommendation.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisers are expected to vote Saturday. The White House has said shots could begin as early as next week.\n\nChildren younger than 5 are the only age group not currently eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19. About 17 million kids will become eligible for Covid-19 vaccines once they’re authorized for this age group.\n\n“To be able to vote for authorization of two vaccines that will protect children down to 6 months of age against this deadly disease is a very important thing,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nShe compared the day to December 2020, when the first Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for adults and older teens.\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said of the Moderna vaccine.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Art Reingold added that even though the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death is lower for young children than for adults, children already get vaccinations to protect them against diseases for which their risk is low.\n\n“If we have a vaccine with benefits that outweigh the risks, then making it available to people is a reasonable choice,” said Reingold, of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“I would point out that we as a country continue to give a large number of vaccines to children where the risk of the child dying or being hospitalized of those diseases are pretty close to zero,” he said, such as polio and measles.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said at Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” said Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nMarks said the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths.\n\nModerna vaccine ‘well-tolerated’ in youngest children\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is already authorized for adults. In a meeting Tuesday, the FDA’s advisers voted unanimously in favor of expanding the emergency use authorization to include older children and teens, ages 6 to 17, saying it would also offer more benefits than risks.\n\nModerna’s Covid-19 vaccine, when given as a 25-microgram dose, is “well-tolerated” in children ages 6 months to 5, said Dr. Rituparna Das, Moderna’s vice president of Covid-19 vaccines clinical development, during Wednesday’s meeting as she described the safety profile of the vaccine among this age group and adverse reactions.\n\n“Pain was the most common event,” Das said. “Young children’s events included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting and chills. For infants and toddlers, events included fever, irritability, crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite.”\n\nThese reactions were more common after the second dose of vaccine and resolved within two or three days, Das said, adding that fever was an important assessment of the vaccine’s safety for this age group.\n\nFever after any dose of vaccine happened in about a quarter of the children, but more often after the second dose, and one incident of febrile seizure was considered to be related to vaccination, Das told the committee members. The child who had the seizure remained in the vaccine study and got a second dose of vaccine with no serious events.\n\nNo deaths or cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported among vaccine recipients, Das said.\n\n“In summary, mRNA-1273 was well tolerated,” she said, using the technical name of Moderna’s vaccine. “Local and systemic reactions were seen less frequently in these youngest groups.”\n\nConcern over number of doses\n\nVRBPAC member Dr. Paul Offit said in Wednesday’s meeting that children who get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will have to complete a three-dose series to get sufficient protection.\n\n” ‘Do the benefits outweigh the risks’ is something I can support, but I do have some concerns about this vaccine,” said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences also mentioned concern that some children might not complete all three doses and that uptake of the vaccine will be slow.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” she said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nData from a phase 2/3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine included 1,678 children who had received a third dose during the period when the Omicron coronavirus variant dominated. The vaccine appeared to be safe and had a strong immune response. The data has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.\n\nAntibody levels tested one month after the third dose showed that the vaccine produced a similar immune response as two doses in 16- to 25-year-olds, the companies said.\n\nIn FDA briefing documents, it was noted that among young children who had received the vaccine in trials, there were no cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis or pericarditis, and the most common adverse reactions among children 6 months to 23 months were irritability, drowsiness, decreased appetite and tenderness at the injection site. For children 2 to 4 years old, the most common adverse reactions were fatigue and pain and redness at the injection site.\n\nWill these children get vaccinated?\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among children in the United States.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBarouch, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November.

However, the FDA also noted that for children in that age group, the “vaccine efficacy could not be reliably determined due to the small number of COVID-19 cases accrued during the study.”\n\nThe vaccine was also found to be safe in all age groups, with adverse reactions described as “mostly mild to moderate in severity, generally of short duration,” and happening more frequently after the second dose than the first, according to the FDA briefing document.\n\nInjection site pain was the most commonly reported adverse reaction. As for serious adverse events, the document described them as infrequent and didn’t raise any concerns.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since recommended the booster, and now everyone 6 months and older is able to receive the updated coronavirus vaccine except kids who got three doses produced by Pfizer/BioNTech.\n\nWhich young children are now eligible to receive the booster? What if kids haven’t started or completed the full series — do they now get the updated booster or the original monovalent vaccine? Can parents and guardians choose between the updated booster and the original shot? What are possible side effects? What if kids had Covid-19 already? And which families should consider the updated booster now and who could wait?\n\nTo help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert, and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health” and the mother of two young children, ages 2 and 5.\n\nCNN: Let’s start with what has just changed in the recommendations: Which young children who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are now eligible to receive the booster?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: There are two vaccines authorized for young children: Moderna and Pfizer. For the youngest age group, the Moderna vaccine was designed to be a two-dose primary vaccine, while the Pfizer version was designed to be a three-dose primary vaccine. That means young children are considered to have completed their primary series if they completed two doses of the Moderna vaccine or if they completed three doses of Pfizer.\n\nAs a reminder, there is now a bivalent booster available for older children and adults. This combines the original (also called monovalent) vaccine with a vaccine that specifically targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants. Because Omicron subvariants constitute virtually all new infections, the hope is that the bivalent booster will provide better, more directed protection.\n\nThe guidance differs for kids 5 and under who received Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine vs. Moderna's version. A 4-year-old receives a Covid vaccine in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, June 21. (Reuters/Hannah Beier) Hannah Beier/Reuters\n\nWhat federal health officials have now said is that children 6 months through 5 years old who received both doses of the original Moderna vaccine are able to get the updated bivalent vaccine — if it has been at least two months since they completed the primary vaccine series.\n\nFor children who received the Pfizer vaccine, the guidance is a little different, because the primary series already involves three doses. Federal health officials have said that children 6 months through 4 years old who have not yet completed their three vaccine doses can receive the third dose as the bivalent vaccine. Let’s say a child has started this series and has had one or two doses of the original Pfizer vaccine. The third dose can now be the updated booster.\n\nCNN: What if kids haven’t started or completed the full series — do they now get the updated booster or the original monovalent vaccine?\n\nWen: The answer is different for Moderna vs. Pfizer. For Moderna, the primary series is two doses, so a child needs to complete the two initial shots with the original formulation. The booster — the third dose — is the bivalent vaccine. For Pfizer, the primary series is three doses. The first two doses still need to be the original formulation, but the third shot is now the bivalent vaccine.\n\nCNN: What about young children who completed three doses of the Pfizer vaccine — are they eligible for a fourth dose?\n\nWen: No. The FDA explicitly says that children 6 months through 4 years old who have completed their three-dose primary series with the original Pfizer vaccine are not eligible for a fourth shot of the bivalent booster. That’s because the primary series of three vaccine doses is still expected to have strong protection against severe illness to Omicron. This recommendation will be reevaluated as new data comes out.\n\nCNN: Can parents and caregivers who have not completed the primary series of Moderna choose the bivalent vaccine as their second dose?\n\nWen: No. The FDA authorization for the adult primary series for Moderna — the two doses — is for the original monovalent vaccine. Similarly, there is no choice for which vaccine formulation is administered as the booster for Pfizer in adults. Only the bivalent booster is available as the third shot, not the original monovalent, which is still given as doses one and two. This mirrors the authorization given for adults — the primary series is the monovalent vaccine, with the only booster for Pfizer and Moderna for adults being the updated booster.\n\nCNN: What are possible side effects from the updated booster?\n\nWen: It’s expected that children who get the updated booster will have similar types of side effects to the original vaccines. These side effects tend to be mild and short-lasting, usually resolving in the first 24 hours after inoculation. Adverse reactions can include pain and swelling in the injection site, fatigue, crankiness, sleepiness, headache, muscle aches and sometimes fever. Many children experience no side effects. The risk of serious side effects, such as myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle), is expected to be exceedingly rare in this younger age group.\n\nCNN: What if kids had Covid-19 already?\n\nWen: People who had Covid-19 can wait three months until after they have recovered from the coronavirus to receive another vaccine dose, according to the CDC. They probably have very good protection against infection in this period.\n\nMany studies have shown that hybrid immunity — recovery from Covid-19 combined with vaccination — conveys very strong protection, arguably even more so than vaccination and boosters alone. In my opinion, I believe a case can be made that if a young child received the primary series and already had Covid, they could wait to receive another booster dose. This is especially true if they had Covid recently, in the last year. To my knowledge, there is no research that shows additional benefit of boosters to young children who recently had Covid-19 infection and who have received their primary vaccinations.\n\nCNN: Which families should consider the updated booster now and who should wait?\n\nWen: First, I think it’s important to point out that the uptake of the primary series of the Covid-19 vaccines among young children is very low. According to the CDC, less than 5% of kids 5 and younger are fully vaccinated. That means we are referring to a very small pool of kids newly eligible for the updated boosters.\n\nThere’s one group that I would definitely recommend getting the updated booster. That’s the group of kids who received their first one or two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. These kids need to complete their primary series. The third dose of that series is now the updated bivalent booster. There’s no reason for families of these children to wait; they should complete the primary series, and it’s a bonus that the third dose is updated to target Omicron.\n\nFor children who received the two doses of the Moderna vaccine, I think the decision-making is different and will depend on families’ individual circumstances. Some families are very concerned about Covid-19 infection. Perhaps their child has underlying medical conditions, or they live with someone who is elderly, immunocompromised or otherwise very vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid-19. Perhaps the family is welcoming a newborn soon, and that baby will be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus infection. I think it’s reasonable to decide that, since Covid-19 cases are rising, this is the time to get their young child the updated booster.\n\nI also think it’s reasonable to wait. My children (ages 2 and 5) received the Moderna vaccines over the summer. They are eligible to be boosted, but I am holding off because the protection that they have against severe illness remains strong. The booster will convey additional protection against symptomatic infection, but that effect is probably short-lasting, according to a June study.\n\nTo be clear, I believe it’s crucial for older adults and vulnerable individuals to receive the updated booster. I also think it’s generally a good thing that people can choose the booster if they wish, as there are compelling individual reasons for different households.\n\nParents and caregivers who have questions should consult their pediatrician to decide the best course of action for their family’s specific circumstances. Finally, families whose children have yet to receive any Covid-19 vaccines should consider starting, especially if their kids are not known to have had Covid-19.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/health/covid-omicron-booster-explainer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccine: Everything you need to know about the Omicron ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a new kind of Covid-19 shot coming to a pharmacy or clinic near you.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on updated boosters that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nWhere can I get an updated Covid-19 booster?\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nWho should get an updated booster?\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nWhen should I get an updated booster?\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nCan people get other vaccines at the same time as the updated booster?\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen can younger children get an updated booster?\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nCan immunocompromised people get an updated booster?\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nAre the updated Covid-19 boosters safe?\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nHow do we know the updated Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nWhy were the shots updated?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/21/fact-check-covid-19-vaccine-nearly-20-years-making/3873247001/", "title": "Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine has been nearly 20 years in the making", "text": "The claim: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed in less than a year, but there are no vaccines against viruses and diseases that have existed for far longer\n\nIt is approaching a year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on Dec. 8, Britain was the first Western country to begin vaccination against the virus. The rollout was followed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 11 and Moderna's on Dec. 18.\n\nGiven the quick scientific response to the newly emerging virus, one Instagram post is calling foul, questioning why vaccines for equally debilitating diseases, predating the pandemic, have not yet been developed.\n\nThe Nov. 30 Instagram post from author Boyce Watkins shares a screenshot of a Facebook comment alleging countless years of research effort have yielded no vaccine.\n\n\"40 years worth of research...no vaccine for HIV (sic) At least 100 years research...no vaccine for cancer (sic) Ongoing research...no vaccine for the common cold (sic) Less than a year for a covid (sic) vaccine? Thanks but a hard pass on that shot...\" claims \"Lee Morin\" in the comment.\n\n\"This does make you wonder: How did you come up with this so fast, but you can't vaccinate against viruses that have been harming people for centuries?\" asks Watkins. The post has received over 13,800 likes and comments agreeing with Watkins' charge.\n\n\"Come on. You have 7 BILLION customers. No other virus/cancer/ailment has that many customer. Follow the money,\" writes Instagram user borzirtc.\n\nOther social media users have posted the same or a similar claim, as recently as Jan. 13.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to those who posted the claim for further comment.\n\nMore:Fact check: COVID-19 outbreak at NY nursing home started before vaccinations\n\nIt began with chickens\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the private-public partnership initiated by the White House during the pandemic, may give the impression the COVID-19 vaccine developed overnight, but in actuality, it depends on research dating back nearly 100 years.\n\nCoronaviruses were first encountered in April 1930, when a strange respiratory disease ravaged poultry farms across North Dakota and Minnesota, killing tens of thousands of baby birds, The Scientist reports. Unsure of what exactly this illness was, veterinarians Arthur Schalk and Merle Hawn of North Dakota Agricultural College, now North Dakota State University, called it \"infectious bronchitis of baby chicks,\" the viral agent later named infectious bronchitis virus.\n\nFurther scientific research into IBV and recognition that it was not like influenza A, a flu virus known to cause bronchitis, would transpire over the next 30 years. In November 1968, a group of scientists wrote to the journal Nature asking for IBV, and viruses resembling it like mouse hepatitis virus discovered in 1947, to be classified as coronaviruses, a name derived from its appearance – the spike proteins casting a halo around the surface, much like the sun's corona – on electron microscope imaging.\n\nMore:Fact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot\n\nSARS was the first attempt at a human coronavirus vaccine\n\nWhile coronaviruses could cause a variety of fatal diseases in animals, the two known to infect humans were not a grave concern, as they only caused the common cold. This belief was challenged in November 2002 with the emergence of a new respiratory illness in Guandong Province, China, that would infect over 8,000 people worldwide and claim 774 lives.\n\nIn less than a month, researchers decoded the enormous genome of the new virus, which caused a disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome. Researchers concluded it was a coronavirus, likely to have jumped from animals to humans because it was only somewhat related to other known coronaviruses. (It took over 15 years of search to identify bats as the potential animal source.) By July 2003, thanks to isolating and quarantining patients, the World Health Organization declared SARS officially contained.\n\nNevertheless, fears of future seasonal SARS outbreaks called for a vaccine. SARS-CoV's spike protein was an obvious choice for a target. Prior research found the spike protein was critical in determining which species a coronavirus infected, where it preferred to hunker down – called organ or cell tropism – and disease severity. The spike protein had even been proposed as a vaccine target for canine coronavirus in 1991.\n\nMore:Fact check: Vaccination helped eradicate smallpox\n\nA number of vaccines targeting the spike protein were designed, tested in animal models and found to be quite promising against SARS and other coronavirus illnesses like Middle East respiratory syndrome, which appeared in 2012. But further testing reached an impasse when funding declined steadily in the years following the 2003 outbreak, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, whose team collaborated with Galveston National Laboratory to create a SARS vaccine in 2016.\n\n\"We manufactured a really great SARS 1 vaccine in the lab. We actually had a manufacturer at Walter Reed, but then we couldn't raise the money to do all the clinical testing,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nFunding was not the only issue. Testing whether a vaccine can prevent disease requires the disease to still be around. Since there have been no major outbreaks of SARS since 2003, testing vaccine efficacy was difficult. But more instrumental is interest: Few SARS or MERS cases meant pharmaceutical companies were less inclined to invest in a likely rarely used vaccine.\n\nMore:Fact check: Doctors say Hilary Duff likely didn't contract pink eye from COVID-19 tests\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nTypically, the road to creating new vaccines is long, with many steps: Finding and developing a vaccine target (exploratory), testing it in tissue or cell cultures and animal models (preclinical) followed by three phases of clinical trials with human volunteers.\n\nIf a vaccine proves its mettle, its developers have to seek and gain approval from the FDA before manufacturing. Lastly, in phase four, quality control monitors for any possible vaccine side effects.\n\nFor vaccines to be effective, a specific target is needed. This vaccine target, also called an antigen, is typically a fragment of the disease-causing agent that instructs the immune system on how to recognize and destroy it upon contact. Searching for a suitable antigen can be an arduous process but prior coronavirus research made it all easier.\n\n\"When the Chinese put up the COVID-19 sequence on bioRxiv in January, our community of scientists looked at it and said, 'Yeah, we got this because we know how to do it.' It was all about plug and play based on all that experience,\" said Hotez.\n\nHaving a running start does not mean the testing process was accelerated, however. Hotez, whose recombinant protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing clinical trials in India, stated the vaccine still underwent testing among a large group of human volunteers, even more than a typical trial with over 30,000 to 60,000 people.\n\nWhat accelerated the vaccine process was manufacturing.\n\n\"The two accelerants are doing the manufacturing of risk (scaling up manufacturing based on the assumption the vaccine will work, also called at-risk manufacturing) and manufacturing the vaccine in parallel with clinical trials. That's new because we usually wait for the phase three results,\" he said.\n\nMore:Fact check: The US saw more deaths in 2020 than in 2019, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nSo why is there no vaccine for HIV, cancer, or the common cold?\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus, the culprit behind acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, commonly known as AIDS, is a tricky virus. Much like the novel coronavirus, HIV binds to a protein on the surface of T cells, a type of white blood cell, to enter. Once inside, HIV integrates its genetic material with its host cell's DNA, using the host's DNA replication machinery to create new viruses, which blast off to infect and kill other T cells.\n\nFinding a specific and effective vaccine target is therefore difficult, especially since HIV mutates frequently in order to mask itself from the immune system. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, common vaccine approaches using inactivated or live HIV forms have either not been \"effective in eliciting immune responses in clinical trials\" or are too dangerous to use.\n\nThe same goes for the common cold, which is caused by a smorgasbord of viruses including over 150 different types of rhinovirus, a common troublemaker.\n\n\"It's hard to create a vaccine when you have so many different viruses causing similar symptoms. To make a universal vaccine against all of them is probably pretty daunting, it might be doable, but it's daunting,\" explained Hotez.\n\nMore:Fact check: Biden said he plans to increase COVID-19 small business relief to people of color and women\n\nCancer, abnormal growth of the body's own cells due to unchecked genetic mutations, is no virus, but the struggle in finding a suitable vaccine target is not any easier.\n\n\"The challenge is getting antigen targets and also access because a lot of the antigens, or cancer proteins, are first inside the cell. They may not be presented to the immune system so these are much more complicated targets,\" said Hotez.\n\nAdvances in messenger RNA-based vaccine technology in recent years may help fast-track some cancer vaccines, he acknowledged. The platform, which provides the body the equivalent of a genetic assembly instruction booklet for manufacturing target-specific antibodies, has been used for rabies, influenza and Zika and is considered an attractive approach for its low cost, speed of manufacturing, potency and versatility, Nature reported.\n\nMany cancer vaccines using mRNA are in the works, like Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, which is being tested in patients with metastatic common epithelial cancer. The Boston-based pharmaceutical company also announced on Jan. 11 it was working on an mRNA HIV vaccine with phase I clinical trials expected sometime in 2021.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nWe rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading. Vaccines require specific targets against which they train the immune system. COVID-19's spike protein was identified nearly 20 years ago as a potential vaccine target during the development of the SARS vaccine, following the 2003 SARS outbreak. This has helped expedite the vaccine process, given that vaccine platform technologies have advanced in recent years, as well. Another accelerant was the commercial-scale production of COVID-19 vaccine doses prior to FDA clearance, called at-risk manufacturing, when early results appeared promising. Finding suitable vaccine targets for HIV, cancer and the common cold has been more difficult in comparison as these diseases have either elusive or highly variable targets.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The board members addressed concerns from the public that adding Covid-19 vaccinations to the schedule would force schools to require the shots.\n\n“We recognize that there is concern around this, but moving Covid-19 to the recommended immunization schedule does not impact what vaccines are required for school entrance, if any,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, a committee member and director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Indeed, there are vaccines that are on the schedule right now that are not required for school attendance in many jurisdictions, such as seasonal influenza. Local control matters, and we honor that. The decision around school entrance for vaccines rests where it did before, which is with the state level, the county level and at the municipal level, if it exists at all. They are the arbiters of what vaccines are required, if any, for school entry. This discussion does not change that.”\n\nIn fact, Covid-19 vaccines are explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states.

Even as these vaccines and the related mandates have become highly politicized over the course of the pandemic, experts say vaccine hesitancy among parents isn’t new.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 shot will not become mandatory for school, all 50 states do have laws requiring specific vaccines for students – most of which include shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and varicella.\n\nUptake for these vaccines, mandated by schools long before Covid-19, fell during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2020-21 school year, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell to less than 94% – dropping below the overall target of 95% that was set as an objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People project for the first time in six years.\n\nA CNN analysis of the latest CDC data suggests that students in states with stricter school vaccine requirements are more likely to have their shots.\n\nAll school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAccording to the CNN analysis, states that were stricter with exemptions were much more likely to still meet the 95% coverage target. In the 2020-21 school year, an average of about 96% of kindergarten students had their MMR vaccine in states that allowed only medical exemptions, compared with 92% of students in states that also allowed philosophical or moral exemptions.\n\nThe full effect of the pandemic on children’s routine vaccination rates isn’t clear: It will be another few months before the CDC shares national data for compliance rates for mandatory vaccinations in the 2021-22 school year, and schools are in the midst of outreach and programming to ensure that as many students as possible will continue through the 2022-23 school year up to date on their vaccines.\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn’t new\n\nCorrecting the drop in vaccination coverage in students will probably depend more on better access to care, information and outreach – and school vaccine mandates can help.\n\nWith many people who are hesitant, it’s “because of something they’ve heard or something they’ve read,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016. “Most people [who are hesitant] have a very free-floating worry about vaccines. It’s not specific in most cases.”\n\nA small share of parents – about 2% or 3% – are adamantly opposed to vaccines, and that rate has stayed mostly consistent over the years, said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.\n\nOverall vaccination coverage fell among kindergarteners in the 2020-21 school year, but the share of students who had an exemption also declined from 2.5% to 2.1%, according to CDC data. The rate has changed by less than 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.\n\nAbout 3% of kindergarteners in the US – about 120,000 students – were considered to be out of compliance with mandatory vaccines in the 2020-21 school year.\n\n“Mandates may not do anything to those people who would pull their kids out of public school,” Hackell said. “But the vast majority of parents are not opposed. They’re hesitant, or they’re uncertain. And when there’s pressure to do it for another reason, such as getting your kid into school, they come around.”\n\nResponsibility for enforcing vaccine mandates falls to the education system, and practices vary by state. Some students are ultimately turned away because they aren’t up to date, but most states offer provisional enrollment periods that allow kids to stay in school if they are in progress with at least one shot in a series or evidence of an upcoming appointment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “school officials may prefer to keep students in school where they have access to education, safe supervision, nutrition, and social services while working with parents or guardians to get children vaccinated.”\n\nAnd many states do their best to help students stay up to date on their immunizations, with vaccination drives and direct followup with parents.\n\n“I think that the drop in the past year or two is partly pandemic-related,” Hackell said. “What we’re seeing, I think, is a little bit of a disparity between kids who have a medical home and have a private [doctor] versus kids who get their immunizations from a public source” like a school clinic.\n\nA model of high vaccination: Mississippi\n\nMississippi is an impressive example of finding ways to keep child vaccination rates high, Hackell says. Public schools are the only option for many in the state, where poverty rates are higher than anywhere else in the US.\n\nDespite the large public need and additional resource struggles that the pandemic brought, 99% of kindergarteners in Mississippi met required vaccination coverage in the 2020-21 school year – better than any other state, according to the CDC.\n\n“They’ve done a tremendous job at that,” Hackell said, and it demonstrates the power of mandates. Mississippi is strict with exemptions – one of just six states allowing medical reasons only – and just 0.1% of kindergarteners were exempt in the 2020-21 school year.\n\nHackell says he would be most concerned if he sees a sustained drop in vaccination rates for highly transmissible diseases, especially measles and polio. And he’s worried about pockets of low vaccination rates in certain communities.\n\nSchools are public spaces with a level of control, and 95% vaccination coverage is a goal with intent.\n\n“We know it’s never going to be 100% because there are some people who cannot medically be vaccinated. But if you have 95%, that means in any given school classroom of 30 kids, there might be one unvaccinated kid. And so if that child brings a case of something into the class, there’s nobody else to give it to,” he said. “It stops there with one case.”\n\nAnd when it comes to adding Covid-19 vaccines to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule, the focus is still on public health – not on adding another requirement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’ve had parents who come in my office, and I say, ‘What are you here for?’ And they say, ‘Well, we’re here for vaccines so that our kids can go to school.’ And I’ve said, ‘OK, I understand that, but really I’m not vaccinating so you can go to school, I’m vaccinating because I want to prevent serious disease and death in your kids,’ ” Dr. Matthew Daley, an ACIP member and senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said at Thursday’s advisory meeting.\n\n“And the fact that there’s a school immunization requirement helps because it brought you into the office, but that’s not my goal. My goal is to prevent serious disease.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/health/vaccine-timeline-under-5-wellness/index.html", "title": "When will the US have a Covid-19 vaccine for the youngest children ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s been more than a year since adults first got Covid-19 vaccines, but about 18 million children under 5 in the US are still waiting – and will probably have to wait until the summer, despite some predictions that shots would be available in the first part of 2022.\n\n\n\nWhile Moderna has shared some data on two doses of Covid-19 vaccine for younger children, Pfizer and BioNTech’s data on three doses for younger children is not yet available.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to consider emergency use authorization for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines for young children at the same time, rather than considering them separately, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, said Thursday.\n\n“Two products that are similar but not identical, particularly with regard to the dose, and what the FDA wants to do is to get it so that we don’t confuse people to say ‘this is the dose. This is the dose regimen for children within that age group of 6 months to 5 years,’ ” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine was made to protect against the original strain of the coronavirus, and the initial series of two 3-milligram doses tested in kids under 5 wasn’t powerful enough to keep them safe from the more infectious Omicron variant.\n\n“It didn’t meet the criteria for efficacy,” Fauci said. “There was never a safety issue, but it didn’t meet the criteria, which then had them go back and do a study with a third dose as a part of the primary regimen.”\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the goal is to have its Covid-19 vaccine available for kids 4 and younger by summer.\n\n“I hope, we will aim to make it in June,” Bourla said on the “In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt” podcast, posted Monday. He said the FDA has been extremely collaborative and flexible during this testing and authorization process.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it couldn’t comment on any particular company’s Covid-19 vaccine EUA request but noted “that at this time, we do not have a complete EUA request in house to consider for children under 5 years of age.”\n\n“We continue to engage with companies to discuss their data, but we cannot adjudicate a decision on any vaccine without a complete EUA request, in order to allow us to do our thorough review. Any timeline on these actions is driven by when the data are provided to FDA and fully support a regulatory action,” FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said.\n\nPfizer studying third doses\n\nWhen Pfizer and BioNTech were testing their vaccine for younger children with two doses, the FDA asked the companies to submit a request for emergency use authorization of that regimen; they said would continue to test a third dose as the two-dose regimen moved through the regulatory process.\n\nIn mid-February, the plan changed again. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the agency needed to see data on the third vaccine dose in these younger children in order to move forward with emergency use authorization.\n\nScientists working on clinical trials for the youngest children have the benefit of observing what happens with other age groups. After seeing breakthrough infections in 2021, especially with the rise of the highly contagious Omicron variant, researchers learned quickly that adults and adolescents needed additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n“When we started comparing not only against Delta, that was the previous one, but against Omicron, we realized the same thing as we realized in adults,” Bourla said. “In adults, two doses, they provide very little protection against Delta. The third dose makes very strong. So we realized that this is the case also for pediatric, so we extended the trials to go to the third dose.\n\n“We will provide you pretty soon data on the third dose, which we think will provide dramatically higher results,” Bourla told Slavitt.\n\n‘Safety is of paramount importance’\n\nModerna has said its vaccine for younger children had a favorable safety profile, and for the Pfizer vaccine, Bourla said “so far, that the safety looks very, very good.”\n\n“My expectation is that we will have zero issues with safety. We’re waiting to see the efficacy, and my expectation is that it will be very good,” Bourla said.\n\n“Safety is of paramount importance,” Bourla said, which is why the company went with a lower dose of vaccine for young children than what’s used in adults.\n\nThe biggest questions that remain for the Pfizer vaccines are exactly how protective the vaccines are, what the right vaccine schedule and dose is. The trials should answer these questions.\n\nIf the vaccine is authorized, little kids could get it on a different schedule than adults and adolescents. Rather than waiting four or five months before a third dose like older ages, the youngest age group could get a third shot as quickly as two months after the second.\n\nChildren are less likely than adults to be hospitalized or to die from Covid-19, but at least 463 children 4 and younger have died from the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“We need [the vaccines],” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. “This virus is going to be with us until I’m dead. I can promise you that.\n\n“We still vaccinate children against polio in this country, and we haven’t had polio in this country for almost 50 years. Why? Because it still exists in this world. This virus is going to exist in the world and continue to do harm.”\n\nOffit said the world is going to need a population that’s highly immune to the coronavirus for a “very long time.”\n\n“Every year, 3½ to 4 million children are born in this country who are unprotected. They are going to need to be protected for some time,” he said. “And the sooner the better, the sooner you can do it safely.”\n\nModerna moves ahead with two doses\n\nModerna has also been working on a vaccine for younger children. Dr. Paul Burton, the company’s chief medical officer, said at the end of March that a vaccine for this age group is a “huge priority.” The company plans to submit its application to the FDA and other regulators around the world “just as soon as we can.”\n\nModerna said its Covid-19 vaccine performs as well in children as it does in adults.\n\nTwo 25-microgram doses provided a similar immune response for children 6 months through 5 years as two 100-microgram doses for adults 18 to 25, the company said, indicating that the benefit conferred to young adults is also conferred to young children.\n\nThe data showed it was safe and had “a robust neutralizing antibody response.” The two doses are given to children 28 days apart.\n\nModerna said it was preparing to evaluate the potential of a booster shot for all children 6 months and older that would target the original strain of the virus as well as the Omicron variant.\n\nBurton told Yahoo Finance last month that he wanted to be “realistic for the parents waiting.”\n\n“We’re still talking a couple of months to the availability of the vaccine. This is not a couple of weeks,” he said.\n\nSteps parents can take now\n\nWhile parents are waiting to vaccinate their little ones, there is something they can do to protect the children.\n\nAll adults who interact with the children should be vaccinated, the experts say, and ideally boosted. Adults are also advised to use masks around unvaccinated children, even as many mandates have fallen away.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDr. Doran Fink, who oversees the FDA’s clinical and toxicological review of investigational and US-licensed vaccines, told the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday that he understood parents’ concerns. He also promised that the FDA would work “diligently” to verify any data submitted.\n\n“We know that many parents and caregivers and health care providers are anxious to have Covid vaccines available for this age group,” Fink said. “I do want to reassure the committee and the public that we understand this concern, and we want to have available safe and effective vaccines for all age groups who will benefit from them.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}]}

But with “Downton Abbey” star Hugh Bonneville as host and a nod to King Charles’ affection for classical music with the inclusion of Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and Welsh baritone Sir Bryn Terfel on the itinerary, the Sunday ceremony charmed the royals as well as the 20,000 fans who secured tickets for the inaugural public event at the castle.\n\nHere are the best moments from the majestic concert here.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nA lighted outline of a lion head hovered above the stage as Katy Perry, wearing a gold gown fit for Cinderella, descended the staircase singing an orchestra-backed rendition of “Roar.” The song sounded grand and was a fitting sentiment for the newly crowned king.\n\nPerry added vocal flourishes and dramatic arm movements in her performance, clearly relishing the opportunity to participate, and even gave a Celine Dion-esque chest bump as “Roar” wrapped.\n\nAlways engaging, Perry told the crowd she brought her mom to the weekend of royal events and stayed in Windsor Castle before dedicating “Firework” to King Charles. Her rendition was lovely, putting even more emphasis on its inspirational lyrics. Perry works with the King’s British Asian Trust in its fight against child-trafficking. In her performance, she thanked him for “being a firework for so many other people.”\n\nPerry worked the stage as she would any concert, pointing at the crowd, which heartily bounced along and waved their Glo-sticks. Obligatory shots of pyro outlines the stage (the song is called “Firework,” after all) as Perry smiled and took a final curtsy, secure in the knowledge that she nailed the once-in-a-lifetime gig.\n\nTake That\n\nTake That, British pop music royalty from the ‘90s, closed the show by leaving the crowd with a heap of positivity.\n\nThe trio of Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, all nattily clad in black suits, kicked off their three-song performance with the on-the-nose “Greatest Day” and called out British singer Calum Scott to join them onstage (sorry, Robbie Williams fans).\n\nThe group’s bouncy “Shine,” from their 2006 comeback album “Beautiful World,” featured a parade of dancers in gold sheaths to add some visual oomph to the stage.\n\nBut they were soon overshadowed by the military drummers and numerous choirs including nurses, doctors and other workers from the U.K.’s National Health Service who filed behind the trio for a massive production of Take That’s 1995 anthem, “Never Forget.”\n\nThe expressions on the faces of Barlow, Owen and Donald, who sounded robust in their harmonizing, indicated that they indeed will always remember the honor of performing for a newly crowned king.\n\nLionel Richie\n\nAs a marquee name on the bill, it was no surprise that Lionel Richie was the first act to perform two songs. He started quietly, sitting at a black baby grand piano in white tails, to unfurl The Commodores’ classic, “Easy.”\n\n“Sounds good, huh?” he asked rhetorically as the crowd swayed and sang along.\n\nRichie, the consummate showman, encouraged his guitarist as he ripped out one of the most recognizable solos in music before popping up from the piano to finish the song next to his spirited sax player. But there was no way Richie was leaving England without offering the obvious party song for a night designed to celebrate.\n\n“All Night Long (All Night)” served its purpose, prompting everyone, including the Royal Family, to stand, dance and “fiesta forever.”\n\nAndrea Bocelli and Sir Bryn Terfel\n\nGiven its omnipresence in pop culture, it’s difficult to remember that “You’ll Never Walk Alone” was written by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their musical “Carousel.”\n\nBut Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and bass-baritone Welsh opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel offered a mighty version of the uplifting song. Backed by an orchestra, their voices boomed as the pair shared stratospheric notes. Their performance also included the first onstage pyro during the concert – but their vocals proved fiery enough.\n\nTiwa Savage\n\nThe Nigerian singer-actress dubbed the Queen of Afrobeats added a majestic presence to the stage in her shimmering emerald gown with a flowing train.\n\nPerforming “Keys to the Kingdom,” her contribution to Beyoncé’s “The Lion King: The Gift” album, Tiwa Savage was flanked by two musicians who provided a percussive breakdown to her vocals.\n\nA beaming Savage leaned toward the crowd, pointing at them as she sang the song’s closing words, “See how the sun and moon bow for you?”\n\nSteve Winwood\n\nThough Steve Winwood has earned much recognition in his 50-plus-year career – his time fronting Traffic and Blind Faith among them – his 1986 worldwide smash, “Higher Love” will always be his signature song.\n\nLooking professorial in his black suit and round glasses, Winwood took center stage as he was backed by both a live choir and, on the video screen wrapping the top of the stage, the Virtual Commonwealth Choir. With voices chiming in from around the world, including Pakistan, Ghana, Australia, Sri Lanka and Rwanda, the song soared. A cutaway to Princess Charlotte and Prince George showed the youngsters waving their British flags and half-mouthing the lyrics, proving “Higher Love” continues to resonate.\n\nLang Lang and Nicole Scherzinger\n\nIn an interesting pairing, Chinese pianist Lang Lang backed Nicole Scherzinger – best known for her tenure in the Pussycat Dolls – in a performance of power ballad “Reflection” from Disney’s “Mulan.”\n\nWhile her song choice was questionable, Scherzinger emoted mightily while singing, her arm pumps matching Lang Lang’s flair at the piano keyboard. Scherzinger, in waist-enhancing blue gown, eked every ounce of drama from the song, prompting Lang Lang to rush over and take a bow with her at the end of the catwalk.\n\nOlly Murs\n\nSet on a circular stage built in front of the castle – “the royal family’s back garden for more than 1,000 years,” joked host Bonneville – the concert’s first major performer, Olly Murs, amped the crowd early. Skipping across the stage in a white suit jacket adorned with a giant flower, the British singer/TV personality weaved around a pack of dancers as he belted his effusive doo-wop-pop hit, “Dance With Me Tonight.”\n\nPaloma Faith\n\nBritish singer-actress Paloma Faith dropped in with the energetic “Lullaby,” her 2018 dance-music collaboration with DJ Sigala. As Faith and her three backup singers pumped their fists while lasers shot around them onstage, the camera cut to viewing parties throughout the U.K., with shots of revelers in Sheffield, Blackpool and Cambridge among the stops. Faith also made a bold fashion statement in her bright red dress and black arm-length gloves, looking glamorous as she bounced through her beats.\n\nCelebrations fit for a king\n\nTop dogs:More than 150 Cavalier King Charles spaniels joined coronation celebration", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/05/08/king-charles-queen-camilla-coronation-portraits/70196863007/", "title": "King Charles III, Queen Camilla share first portraits after coronation", "text": "King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla released their first official portraits following the coronation.\n\nThe portraits, taken by photographer Hugo Burnand and released by Buckingham Palace, arrived on the royal family's official Instagram account Monday, along with a message from King Charles.\n\n\"As the Coronation weekend draws to a close, my wife and I just wanted to share our most sincere and heartfelt thanks to all those who have helped to make this such a special occasion,\" reads the caption on a photo of the couple together. \"We pay particular tribute to the countless people who have given their time and dedication to ensuring that the celebrations in London, Windsor and further afield were as happy, safe and enjoyable as possible.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"To those who joined in the celebrations - whether at home, at street parties and lunches, or by volunteering in communities - we thank you, each and every one.

All about their feud\n\nKing Charles' favorite dog breed is the Jack Russell, initially bred for fox hunting. Two of them − Bluebell and Beth − live with him and the queen consort at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAccording to the Royal Kennel Club of Britain, which claims to be the world's oldest organization devoted to canine affairs such as breeding, training, showing, dog welfare, the King Charles spaniel and its cousin the Cavalier King Charles spaniel can be traced to at least the 16th century.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I, who ruled from 1558 to 1603, was reported to have had a \"spaniel gentle.\"\n\nSome historians believe that when Charles I was executed in 1649 during the English Civil War, his black-and-white spaniel, Rogue, was at his side. When his son, Charles II, was later restored to the throne, he rarely went anywhere without a cluster of spaniels in tow. They were likely at his bedside when he died.\n\n'They are the most cat-like of the dogs'\n\nBack on King's Road, the parade didn't exactly go to plan.\n\n\"They are the most catlike of the dogs,\" said Candace Queathem, one of the event's organizers, of the spaniels.\n\n\"But don't quote me on that,\" she laughed.\n\nThen Queathem strode down King's Road to get the dogs ready for the start of the march.\n\nThe order lasted for about a block.\n\nThen because of the rain, because of the crowds and because of, well, dogs again, the parade descended into a lot of dogs doing a lot of different things.

Days later, he was formally confirmed as the new King of the United Kingdom in a ceremony at St. James’ Palace.\n\nThe British government said in a statement that the move was in line with the bank holiday that accompanied the late Queen’s coronation in 1953. The day off would be an opportunity for families and communities across the United Kingdom to come together to celebrate, it added.\n\n“The Coronation of a new monarch is a unique moment for our country,” Sunak said. “In recognition of this historic occasion, I am pleased to announce an additional bank holiday for the whole United Kingdom next year.\n\n“I look forward to seeing people come together to celebrate and pay tribute to King Charles III by taking part in local and national events across the country in his honour.”\n\nBuckingham Palace announced last month that the King’s coronation would take place on May 6 at Westminster Abbey in London, the location of every coronation since 1066.

It added that the occasion will still be “rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.”\n\nThe occasion will also see the Queen Consort crowned in a similar but smaller ceremony.\n\nExperts say Charles’s coronation will be a significantly more subdued event than his mother’s, with arrangements influenced by the ongoing cost-of-living crisis in the UK.\n\nIt’s fairly common for the government to proclaim bank holidays around royal occasions.

While King Charles III has been monarch from the moment his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died on Sept. 8, 2022, the ceremony Saturday marked a formal confirmation of his role as head of state.\n\nIt's been 70 years since Britain has crowned a new monarch.\n\nThe official service began at Westminster Abbey at 6 a.m. EDT.\n\nProminent attendees included first lady Jill Biden, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.\n\nPrince Harry attended, but without wife Meghan and their kids.\n\nSee below for everything that happened during King Charles and Camilla's coronation.\n\nBiggest moments from the coronation:King Charles and Camilla crowned, Prince Harry arrives\n\nCoronation day winds down, celebration continues\n\nThe king and queen retreated from the balcony and the pomp and ceremony began to wind down for the day. The pair was set to enjoy a late lunch.\n\nMeanwhile, the party is far from over. Thousands remained in the streets of London despite unfortunate weather conditions. On Sunday, the coronation concert will carry on the tune of celebration.\n\n— Morgan Hines\n\nKing Charles, Queen Camilla, royal family make Buckingham balcony appearance\n\nIt's a time-honored tradition for the British royals: the balcony appearance to greet the populace – think coronations, royal weddings, jubilees. Thousands gathered, pressing as close as possible to see Buckingham Palace. The anticipated appearance is often gleeful, but one question cast a shadow over the approaching moment: whether Prince Harry would join his family members despite stepping back from royal duties.\n\nThe royal couple walked out together to a roar of applause, leading out their attendants and pages. Other members of the royal family, including the working royals such as Princess Anne, the Prince and Princess of Wales, their children, and cousins of the king, appeared as the rain poured down. Prince Harry and Prince Andrew were not included in the balcony moment.\n\nThe moment included a flyover and a sort of encore appearance with the newly crowned duo coming back out for a final wave set to the tone of the cheers below.\n\n– Morgan Hines\n\nSee the photos:King Charles, royal family (not Harry) together on Buckingham Palace balcony\n\nWho paid for the coronation?\n\nThe British public is footing the bill for the coronation. There is no official estimate yet of what it cost, though some reports estimate it could top $125 million. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said days before the coronation that some estimates were \"more fanciful than others\" and that the true cost would be shared later.\n\nThe celebration comes as the U.K. weathers a bruising cost-of-living crisis that left many struggling to heat their homes this winter and put food on their tables. But officials are expecting to see a tourism boost, and there is no shortage of coronation-themed events and commemorative products that could ring up additional sales taxes.\n\n– Brian Melley, The Associated Press\n\nGeorge, Charlotte, Louis:See the royal grandchildren on coronation day\n\n4,000-person royal salute to new monarchs\n\nBagpipes played as troops gathered, walking in unison to take their places on the grounds of Buckingham Palace preparing to give their commander-in-chief a royal salute made up of 4,000 people, including Princess Anne.\n\nOnce in formation, facing where King Charles III and Queen Camilla stepped out in full robes and crowns to receive their salute. \"Royal salute, present arms,\" said a uniformed man before music commenced. Most troops removed their headdress before saluting, and a resounding \"hooray\" rang out.\n\n– Morgan Hines\n\nIs King Charles' coronation a bank holiday?\n\nIf you are reading this from the U.S., move along, because it doesn’t really pertain to you. However, for those in the U.K., a bank holiday will take place on Monday, May 8, two days after the ceremony, to mark the coronation of King Charles III, per the BBC. On Monday, members of the public are to be encouraged to join \"The Big Help Out\" – which is being organized as a nod to Charles’ public service efforts – and volunteer in their local communities.\n\n– Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines\n\nRoyal procession to Buckingham Palace\n\nThe rain stopped for some time as the newly crowned king and queen processed toward Buckingham Palace while onlookers strove to catch a glimpse or wave a British flag, with some dressed up to fit the theme.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla waved to the crowd from a gilded carriage, the Gold State Coach, used only on the way to Buckingham Palace for the coronation procession. Parade participants bobbed around the carriage in formal dress on horseback while many others walked.\n\nIn a subsequent carriage, Prince William and Princess Kate rode with their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

Camilla was crowned with Queen Mary's crown, marking the first time an existing crown was used for the queen consort's coronation.\n\n\"May thy servant Camilla, who wears this crown, be filled by thine abundant grace and with all princely virtues; reign in her heart, O King of love, that, being certain of thy protection, she may be crowned with thy gracious favor; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen,\" the Archbishop of Canterbury said as he placed the crown on Camilla's head.\n\nCamilla’s title is not changing after coronation. Since her husband became king, she assumed the title Queen Consort Camilla. However Queen Camilla will do. It's nicely alliterative and the \"consort\" part is understood.\n\n– Naledi Ushe\n\nPrince William kneels before Charles and swears his loyalty\n\nThe Prince of Wales, first in line to the British throne, swore his loyalty to Charles in a ceremony known as \"The Homage of Royal Blood.\"\n\nWilliam kneeled before his father, placing his hands in between Charles' hands as he said, \"I, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.\"\n\nThe ceremonious vow took place shortly after Charles' crowning and \"The Homage of The Church of England,\" which was carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nFollowing William's oath was the \"Homage of The People,\" which is also led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This is a new addition to the coronation, which invites the general public to declare: \"I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\"\n\n– Naledi Ushe\n\nCharles is crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nCharles was crowned with St. Edward's crown.\n\n\"Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth this seat of royal dignity, which is yours by the authority of Almighty God.

Camilla's corresponding cross scepter is pared down with crystals instead of diamonds, with a cross sitting on the top.\n\nThe dove scepter, which is also named \"The Rod of Equity and Mercy,\" is representative of Charles' spiritual duties with the dove signifying the Holy Ghost. Camilla's dove rod will be made of ivory with a dove sitting atop a golden globe.\n\nKing Charles' orb, which weighs almost 3 pounds, and was made in the 17th century. The crown jewel represents the king's power while representing the Christian world as a cross sits atop the sphere. The orb is placed in King Charles' right hand before its placed at the altar.\n\n— Elise Brisco\n\nGuide of crowns, rings, scepters and other shiny royal jewels\n\nCharles wears two crowns during the ceremony: St. Edward's crown and the Imperial State Crown. The former crown is used for ceremony purposes before being switched out for the Imperial Crown, or Tudor Crown, for the procession back to Buckingham Palace. Camilla wore Queen Mary's Crown.\n\nFor more on the crowns, rings, rods and scepters you see during the ceremony, check out our guide to coronation jewels.\n\n– Elise Brisco\n\nCharles is anointed with a special coronation oil\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury anoints the king in the form of a cross using a special coronation oil behind an anointing screen. The Chrism oil used in his coronation was in Jerusalem in March to be consecrated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III and Anglican Archbishop Hosam Naoum. The chrism oil, or holy oil, used in Charles’ coronation is based from the same oil that was used in Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.\n\nComprised of olives harvested from the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, the oil was taken from groves located at the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace. The Monastery of Mary Magdelene is the burial place of King Charles III's paternal grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece.\n\n– Elise Brisco\n\nKing Charles III's coronation oilhas special connection to late mother Queen Elizabeth II\n\nWhat crown is Charles wearing?\n\nFollowing tradition, Charles is crowned with St. Edward's crown.

The king then swore on the bible to uphold laws governed by the Church of England.\n\nIn an innovation that reflects the changed religious landscape in Britain, the king for the first time prayed for grace to be \"a blessing to all of every faith and belief.\"\n\nCharles ceremoniously took the \"coronation oath\" over the bible \"to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, your other Realms and the Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining.\"\n\nAs he placed his hand on the bible, Charles said, \"The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.\"\n\nHe then kissed the bible as the Archbishop of Canterbury said, \"Your Majesty, are you willing to make, subscribe, and declare to the statutory Accession Declaration Oath?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" Charles responded. \"I Charles do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God profess, testify, and declare that I am a faithful Protestant, and that I will, according to the true intent of the enactments which secure the Protestant succession to the Throne, uphold and maintain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law.\"\n\n– Naledi Ushe\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury recognizes Charles as the 'undoubted King'\n\nCharles proceeded to stand next to the coronation chair during the Archbishop of Canterbury’s recognition.

The 5-year-old stole the show at the late queen’s Platinum Jubilee with his meme-worthy facial expressions during the flypast as the royal family gathered on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWilliam and Kate's other son, 9-year-old Prince George, served as one of King Charles' Pages of Honor. In his role, he helped hold King Charles robe during the King’s Procession at the outset of the ceremony.

The Household Cavalry Mounted Band is leading the military procession.\n\nIt’s a much smaller procession than the one for the return route from the abbey, with some 4,000 troops featured in a spectacular display of pageantry.\n\nThe state coach Charles and Camilla traveled in was created in 2012 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II’s 60th year on the throne.

By her side was her granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, who wore yellow head to toe in Markarian.\n\nThe president and the first lady jointly attended last year’s funeral in London for Queen Elizabeth II. Jill Biden wore a similar fascinator headband to the funeral, but in black. Some criticized the first lady for her selection, noting that fascinators are often seen at joyous events. While they can be worn to somber events like funerals, the more accepted etiquette would be to wear a hat as a sign of respect.\n\n– Amy Haneline\n\nCrowds line procession route with supporters and protestors\n\nThousands of people from across the U.K. and around the world camped overnight along the 1.3-mile route to catch a glimpse of the monarch. The crowd included both supporters and protestors.\n\nThe anti-monarchy group Republic told the Associated Press several of its members have been arrested as they prepared to protest the coronation and hold \"Not my king\" signs. But on Saturday morning, several of the group’s members were stopped near Trafalgar Square and led to police vans.\n\nOthers managed to protest along the route, waving signs that read \"king parasite\" and \"abolish the monarchy.\" Police have said they will have have a \"low tolerance\" for people seeking to disrupt the day, sparking criticism that they are clamping down on free speech.\n\n– Amy Haneline and The Associated Press\n\nVideo of previous protests:Police arrest man for throwing eggs at King Charles III and Camilla\n\nWhen is the coronation concert and who’s performing?\n\nAfter the coronation is the coronation concert.

He immediately ascended the throne when Elizabeth died Sept. 8. But the deeply religious and regalia-heavy event is a more formal confirmation of his role as head of state and titular head of the Church of England and was intended to show the king’s authority was derived from God.\n\nThat said, there is no legal requirement for a coronation, and other European monarchies have done away with the ceremonies.\n\n– Brian Melley, The Associated Press\n\nHow and where can you watch the coronation?\n\nTune into USA TODAY's livestream and follow along with us here during the ceremony.

His wife, Queen Consort Camilla, was also crowned at the coronation.\n\nThe ceremony Saturday marked a formal confirmation of the role as head of state for Charles, who has been monarch from the moment his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died on Sept. 8, 2022.\n\nThe coronation saw the expected pomp and circumstance from fancy crowns to elaborate wardrobes, celebrity appearances from Lionel Richie and Katy Perry, Prince William kneeling before his father, Prince William and Princess Kate's children participating in the service and the return of Prince Harry.\n\nKeep reading for the biggest moments of the coronation, from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey to the procession back and forth.\n\nCharles III's coronation live updates:King and Queen Consort crowned, procession begins\n\nKing Charles III formally crowned:A recap of the monarch's coronation day\n\nRoyal family appear on Buckingham Palace balcony – without Prince Harry\n\nIt's a time-honored tradition for the British royals: the balcony appearance to greet the populace – think coronations, royal weddings, jubilees. Thousands gathered, pressing as close as possible to see Buckingham Palace. The anticipated appearance is often gleeful, but one question cast a shadow over the approaching moment: whether Harry would join his family members despite stepping back from royal duties.\n\nThe royal couple walked out together to a roar of cheers, leading out their attendants and pages. Other members of the royal family, including the working royals such as Princess Anne, the Prince and Princess of Wales, their children, and cousins of the king, appeared as the rain poured down. Prince Harry and Prince Andrew were not included in the balcony moment.\n\nThe moment included a flyover.\n\nKing Charles, royal family (not Harry)together on Buckingham Palace balcony: See the photos\n\nKing Charles III crowned as Britain's monarch\n\nCharles was crowned with St. Edward's crown. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth, wore the same crown at her 1953 coronation.\n\n\"Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth this seat of royal dignity, which is yours by the authority of Almighty God.

Camilla was crowned with Queen Mary's crown, marking the first time an existing crown was used for the queen consort's coronation.\n\n\"May thy servant Camilla, who wears this crown, be filled by thine abundant grace and with all princely virtues; reign in her heart, O King of love, that, being certain of thy protection, she may be crowned with thy gracious favor; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen,\" the Archbishop of Canterbury said as he placed the crown on Camilla's head.\n\nQueen Camilla looks regalas she is crowned at King Charles III coronation: See photos\n\nPrince Harry, Prince William sat separately at coronation\n\nAs much as the coronation of Charles is about, well, the king, much of the interest was focused on his sons, William and Harry, as the two brothers reunite.\n\nThe past few years have brought to light publicly the complicated relationship between the next heir to the British throne and his younger brother, referred to as the Spare in the palace growing up, as Harry recounted in his tell-all memoir earlier this year.\n\nHarry arrived at Westminster Abbey with his cousins, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice along with their husbands, Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, respectively. William arrived a few minutes later with Kate and their children, Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.\n\nHarry sat in a row behind William's, on the opposite end.\n\nPrince Harry, Prince Williamexit coronation separately. Look back on their complicated relationship\n\nPrince William knelt before Charles and swore his loyalty\n\nThe Prince of Wales, who is first in line to the British throne, swore his loyalty to Charles in a ceremony known as \"The Homage of Royal Blood.\"\n\nWilliam kneeled before his father, placing his hands in between Charles' hands as he said, \"I, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.\"\n\nThe ceremonious vow took place shortly after Charles' crowning and \"The Homage of The Church of England,\" which was carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nPrince George held Charles' robe as a Page of Honor\n\nWilliam and Kate's oldest son, 9-year-old George served as one of King Charles' Pages of Honor. Carrying one corner of Charles' gilded robe, he walked in the procession with the king and queen consort into Westminster Abbey at the outset of the ceremony and stood behind the King during important moments inside the church.\n\nPrince George wore red ceremonial garments signifying his official duties.\n\nRoyal grandchildren on coronation day:See Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis\n\nThe king's grandchildren stole the show\n\nTheir grandfather was the star of the show, but it didn't take much for the royal kids to steal the spotlight.\n\nDuring the coronation, all eyes were on his adorable and precocious grandchildren − George, Charlotte, and Louis. Clad in elaborate garments as they sat through the long coronation ceremony, the young Windsors caught the eye of spectators and fans during the historic event.\n\nCharlotte and Louis joined the procession into the Abbey and then took their places in the crowd along with their parents, William and Kate. At one point, Charlotte and Louis were photographed holding hands.\n\nCharlotte wore an Alexander McQueen dress and cape in ivory silk crepe with ivory satin stitch embroidery featuring rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs, to signify the four nations of the United Kingdom, according to Buckingham Palace. Her sparkly headpiece is by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen. Louis wore an outfit made by Dege and Skinner, which consists of a Hainsworth garter and blue doeskin tunic with specially designed lace work embellishment to the collar, cuffs and fronts.\n\nSarah Fergusonassembles 'tea fit for a King' in honor of Charles' coronation\n\nPrincess Kate and Princess Charlotte matched in Alexander McQueen\n\nThe Princess of Wales attended her father-in-law's ascension to the throne in one of her favorite labels, Alexander McQueen.\n\nCatherine, 41, arrived at Westminster Abbey Saturday in an ivory silk crepe dress embroidered at the hem with rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs (referencing the four nations of the United Kingdom). The McQueen dress, which the princess paired with white stiletto pumps, peeked out beneath her blue and red robe, embellished with the Royal Victorian Order Mantle star.\n\nKate added sparkle to Saturday's look with a show-stopping headpiece featuring three-dimensional leaves made of silver bullion, crystal and silver thread by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen.\n\nCharlotte matched her mother in McQueen, wearing an ivory dress featuring embroidery with the same motifs.\n\nPrincess Kate and Princess Charlotte'smatching McQueen moment at the coronation\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden arrived at the coronation service with granddaughter Finnegan Biden\n\nFirst lady Dr. Jill Biden arrived Saturday morning wearing a royal blue Ralph Lauren suit dress with a matching bow headpiece. By her side was her granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, who wore yellow head to toe in Markarian.\n\nIt was announced in April that Jill Biden would represent the U.S. at Charles' coronation and President Joe Biden would not attend the occasion. No sitting U.S. president has ever attended a British royal coronation.\n\nJoe Biden said in a tweet that \"the enduring friendship between the U.S. and the U.K. is a source of strength for both our peoples.\"\n\nJill Biden called it an honor to be at Westminster Abbey \"on this historic day.\"\n\nKaty Perry, Lionel Richie, more celebs attended the coronation\n\nThe British monarch, crowned Saturday, will celebrate with a star-studded coronation concert Sunday broadcast across BBC's channels.\n\nThe news organization announced the long-awaited list of performers, which includes \"American Idol\" judges Lionel Richie and Katy Perry as well as local British stars.

Athletic excellence is being showcased in a sport that greatly rewards players who have chiseled themselves into physical supermen, even to the point that cheating has become a somewhat routine part of that process.\n\nSince 2001, NFL players have been suspended for performance-enhancing drugs and related substances at least 258 times, including at least 82 times in the past five years, according to a newly published database compiled by USA TODAY Sports. The violations have affected every team in the league and every position on the field, including players who have been named to the Pro Bowl and even long snappers, quarterbacks and at least one placekicker.\n\nBut do viewers even care? Or does it actually make the NFL product more appealing?\n\nEXCLUSIVE DATABASE: NFL players suspended for performance-enhancing drug use since 2001\n\n“I’ve argued for years drugs add to the entertainment, because what you pay big money to see is bigger-than-life people doing bigger-than-life stuff,” said Charles Yesalis, a longtime performance-enhancing drug expert at Penn State. “And if you aren’t, then hell, watch a high school football game instead.”\n\nHe has a point. Viewers didn’t seem to care, if they even knew, that a player who recently had been suspended under the league’s performance-enhancing drugs policy helped the San Francisco 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs last month with a key blocked punt in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat player, Jordan Willis, was suspended six games to start the season – an indication he was suspended for using an anabolic agent, according to the league’s list of penalties for first-time offenses. The game drew nearly 37 million viewers, according to Fox Sports, making it the most-watched show on a Saturday night since the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nViewers also didn’t seem to care three years ago when New England Patriots receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP after starting the season with a four-game suspension for a violation of the league’s policy for PEDs. CBS broadcasters didn’t mention it during the game when Edelman caught 10 passes and nearly 100 million people watched on average, according to Nielsen data.\n\nBy contrast, Major League Baseball players are barred from the postseason if they were previously suspended that year for taking performance-enhancing drugs. Yet PED usage comes with far less of a stigma in football than in baseball, where some of the best players of all time last month were denied entry into the Hall of Fame because of their link to such substances.\n\nThe reason for this is up for debate. Less debatable is how PED-related suspensions have become part of the regular drumbeat of the NFL calendar, sometimes with 20 or more per year. They’ve even happened so frequently that they’ve become relatively unremarkable incidents, especially compared to all the other controversies in the NFL, including racial issues and one player's comments about vaccines.\n\nHow big of a problem is it?\n\nThe suspensions only represent around 1% or fewer of all NFL players each year. But Yesalis long has suspected the actual PED usage is far greater, much like in cycling, where admitted dopers avoided testing positive in drug tests. “Only careless and stupid people get caught,” he said.\n\nAnd getting caught is easier to avoid if the testing program has soft spots.\n\nTravis Tygart, the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, points out that while the NFL conducts a high number of drug tests per year – estimated at 12,000-plus – the league’s anti-doping policy isn’t as good as it could be if it really wanted to detect the true level of PED use in the game. On the one hand, he said the NFL’s program is better than many others that are compliant with the rules of the independent World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nOn the other hand, the NFL’s PED policy is not set by an independent party such as USADA. The policy instead is made in a negotiation between league management and the players’ union, both of which arguably have an interest in keeping a lid on the problem.\n\n“Given the violent nature of the sport, the short-term careers of their athletes and the money that can be made, the NFL should have the best independent, anti-doping program in the world,” Tygart told USA TODAY Sports. “Unfortunately, it is hard to argue that they do.”\n\nThe NFL didn’t respond to messages seeking an interview on its PED policy, which also forbids masking agents or diuretics used to hide the presence of PEDs.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports database only includes suspensions that have been publicly revealed. It still provides a window into how pervasive the problem is among certain players, what the most popular drug has been (according to players) and how players usually say they didn’t take these drugs knowingly, which is at least sometimes true.\n\nThe players' union cited this issue when contacted by USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\"The league does not have a performance-enhancing substance problem,\" said Brandon Parker, spokesman for the NFL Players Association. \"We have found that a large number of the violations are ultimately deemed to be unintentional use of a supplement that was contaminated.\"\n\nParker acknowledged that \"innocent use is not a defense\" for players who are held responsible for what is in their bodies. \"Innocent\" or not, some get busted more than others.\n\nMost frequent violators\n\nDefensive linemen (57) and linebackers (41) are the most common offenders, according to the database. Those positions place a premium on strength, size and speed. One of them, former Chicago Bears linebacker Jerrell Freeman, was suspended twice before retiring in 2018 when he faced two-year suspension for a third violation.\n\n“It’s pretty black and white,” Freeman told USA TODAY Sports recently. “Rules are rules.”\n\nHe declined to elaborate further.\n\nThe team with the most suspensions in the database is Tampa Bay with 13. By contrast, USA TODAY Sports could find only two for the Buffalo Bills. At least two different punters and a placekicker have been busted, too, twice for unapproved use of the stimulant Adderall.\n\n'Superhuman’ drug\n\nThough the types of drugs involved in these suspensions is confidential, Adderall is by far the most popular drug named by players. It comes up in at least 25 suspensions since 2009. A number of players have therapeutic-use exemptions for it if they’ve been approved for them by the testing program’s independent administrator or medical advisor. Under a doctor’s prescription, it is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But it also is used to increase energy and focus, and those who are suspended for it do not have exemptions.\n\nFormer Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee said on his radio show last year that he tried the drug after he retired and understood its popularity in the league.\n\n“I cannot believe there are therapeutic use exemptions in the NFL where guys are allowed to take Adderall because they’ve talked to a doctor,” he said. “I felt like a superhuman.”\n\nEven so, the NFL isn't exactly cracking down on it. In an apparent tradeoff between the players’ union and league management, the two sides recently agreed to reduce penalties for the in-season use of stimulants such as Adderall.\n\nThe new collective bargaining agreement in 2020 reduced suspensions for first-time offenses from four games to two while also reducing suspensions for second offenses from 10 games to five. At the same time, the two sides also agreed to increase the penalties for anabolic agents or steroids – lengthening those suspensions from four to six games for a first offense and 10 games to 17 games for a second offense.\n\nParker said penalties for stimulants were reduced because the NFLPA views those drugs more as \"substances of abuse,\" as opposed to performance-enhancing. The NFL has a separate substance-abuse policy for such drugs, including alcohol and marijuana.\n\n\"We wanted to take a more treatment-based approach to help our player members versus a punitive approach,\" Parker said.\n\n'Intelligent’ testing?\n\nOne way to tell how serious a league is about catching dopers is by considering how it selects players for urine or blood testing.\n\nThe NFL began testing players for human growth hormone in 2014 but caught no players using it the first year, and it’s unclear how many have been caught ever since. In 2017, then-NFL spokesperson Joe Lockhart acknowledged players have tested positive and been suspended for HGH, but he said the players’ union was blocking the league from getting into more detail.\n\n“It is a tough substance to detect” without specific intelligence about an athlete using it, Tygart said.\n\nHGH detection requires blood testing, and the NFL’s PED policy states that 20% of each team’s players will be blood-tested at random each year in training camp. Players from each team also will be randomly selected for blood testing each week during the preseason and regular season, plus five from each playoff team. In the offseason, the testing program’s independent administrator will randomly assign 10% of each team’s players for blood testing, according to the league policy.\n\nSimilarly, the NFL tests the urine of every player in training camp and also tests the urine of 10 random players per team each week from the preseason through the postseason. In the offseason, urine testing is done at the discretion of the testing program’s independent administrator, up to a maximum of six offseason tests per player.\n\nTo catch cheaters, Tygart said the best anti-doping methods involve the global standard of intelligence-driven testing, not random testing, which is a core part of the NFL PED policy.\n\nWith intelligence-driven testing, the idea is to profile and target athletes suspected of doping based on observations, whistleblowers, unusual speed or weight increases, or if they’re coming back from an injury.\n\nBut the NFL’s PED policy doesn’t call for this except if there is “reasonable cause” to do so, such as from “credible, verifiable documented information providing a reasonable basis to conclude that a player may have violated the policy.”\n\nThe difference between random testing results and targeted testing results is stark. For USADA, the positivity rate for testing is 1% or less.\n\n“But our targeted testing numbers, when we test off of specific information, has been roughly 20% positive or in the results management process,” Tygart said.\n\nThe explanations\n\nWhen players are willing to explain why they got caught, they almost always say they don’t know – and that it must have been in their dietary supplements or medication without their knowledge. This could be a bogus excuse. It also could be true.\n\nFor example, Houston offensive tackle Duane Brown got his 10-game suspension overturned in 2016 after testing positive for clenbuterol, an anabolic agent. The explanation behind his appeal was that he ingested the drug unknowingly by eating contaminated beef in Mexico. It was a credible excuse. The NFL and NFLPA even sent out a warning about this risk of eating meat produced in Mexico or China.\n\nIn another case, St. Louis Rams linebacker David Vobora was awarded $5.4 million in 2011 after he sued a supplements maker after testing positive for methyltestosterone and being suspended four games in 2009. In his lawsuit, he said that he used the company’s product without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\n'Players want this’\n\nTo its credit, the NFL historically has been ahead of the curve in trying to address this issue among American pro sports leagues. The question then and now is whether it’s doing enough.\n\nIn 1989, Atlanta Falcons offensive lineman Bill Fralic testified to Congress that an estimated 75% of linemen used steroids then, before the NFL began testing and punishing offenders for it later that year after banning it in 1983. Then on one day in August 1989, 13 players were suspended for steroid use.\n\nMore than 30 years later, stimulants might be more the rage these days than old-fashioned steroids, which come with harsher penalties. Tygart said one complaint about the NFL PED policy is that it bans a “finite list” of stimulants and doesn’t have a “catchall” for designer stimulants, unlike the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\n“A lot of people interpret that as a license to use designer stimulants, and there’s no consequence, so that’s a problem,” Tygart said.\n\nHe argues that the best way to combat PED use also involves having an independent agency such as USADA take over the policy, instead of having the policy set by the league and players’ union. But that likely won’t happen for one reason – The NFL would be giving up control. So would the players’ union.\n\n“The players want this policy as much as the league does,” said Jodi Balsam, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who formerly managed litigation for the NFL. “It’s been very carefully and thoroughly negotiated.”\n\nThe motive to use such drugs can be powerful for players looking for an edge in a violent game with millions of dollars at stake. Former NFL quarterback Brady Quinn suggested on a CBS podcast in 2015 that for a player making $1 million per game, the risk of a four-game suspension for PEDs didn’t compare to the potential rewards that could come with them, such as a bigger payoff later.\n\n“Am I going to sacrifice $4 million in order for me to get that big contract on the back end?” Quinn asked hypothetically. “Yeah, I am.\"\n\nYesalis argues the policy serves as a marketing shield of plausible deniability for the NFL, helping it seem like the league cares about PED use from a health standpoint. Yet by not going as far as it could with this policy, a case could be made that the league leaves just enough room open for it to gain the elevated level of play that comes with these substances.\n\n“The average Joe or Mary Doe sport fan either doesn’t know what Adderall is or couldn’t care less,” Yesalis said. “I don’t think your average sport fan really cares who uses drugs. They want to be entertained.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer. E-mail: bschrotenb@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}]}

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 2nd of May 2023. Today, a look at the fallout after First Republic Bank was seized and sold to JP Morgan Chase. Plus, President Joe Biden invites congressional leaders to the White House for talks on avoiding a default on the nation's debt, and we have a recap from the Met Gala.\n\n◆Regulators seized First Republic Bank yesterday and sold all of its deposits and most assets to JP Morgan Chase. The move marks one of the biggest bank failures in US history. I spoke with USA TODAY Money and Personal Finance Reporter Medora Lee to learn more. Hello Medora.\n\nMedora Lee: Hi, how are you?\n\nTaylor Wilson: Good, thanks. So, First Republic Bank has been sold off to JP Morgan Chase. What's the latest here?\n\nMedora Lee: So the latest is, after a lot of wrangling over the weekend, JP Morgan Chase has decided that it will take up First Republic Bank. So that means that they are going to take over all of the unsecured deposits that First Republic Bank has, so everybody's money is safe, so that's a good thing. And they are going to split some of the losses that the bank has for some of its mortgages and other sort of debt instruments and they're going to split it with the FDIC.\n\nTaylor Wilson: And Medora, who used First Republic?\n\nMedora Lee: So it was mostly wealthy people who put their money into First Republic Bank. First Republic Bank had this kind of strategy, they prided themselves in customer service for their wealthy clients to get their money to deposit into the bank. And then they would take that money and they would use it for loans, for houses or whatever, for other rich people. And so the big lure was the CEO thought that they could get away with this, offering very little interest when interest rates were low and maybe putting out a mortgage for like 3% rate or something less than that even. And so they would just make the difference.\n\nBut when interest rates started to rise, their rich people decided they really didn't need all those great services that First Republic was giving them and they started moving their money to higher interest-bearing accounts. So this caused a huge problem. First Republic had to cover those deposits, but at the same time now they were losing money on those mortgages because interest rates had shot up so much. So this was where that big hole really came to fruition here and got them in trouble.\n\nTaylor Wilson: And how does this compare to the two other bank collapses that we saw earlier this year?\n\nMedora Lee: It was pretty similar. A lot of those banks also had what they call interest rate risk. The other banks were too invested in long-term treasuries because everything was paying so little. And then when the Fed started to raise interest rates so much and the value of those treasuries dropped, they started having these big holes in their balance sheets.\n\nTaylor Wilson: So Medora, this is the second-biggest bank failure in US history. How worried should people be that this could spread to other banks around the country?\n\nMedora Lee: This is the million-dollar question. If you listen to Jamie Diamond, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, he reminds us all that the financial system is sound, but I think there's still some worries out there. The whole thing is we are only supposed to save the biggest and most important banks. And here, are we kind of reaching now into regional banks that we have to save, too? and then where's the line? And people get nervous and now that we've saved so many banks, are they going to target another bank? I don't know. I'm not really sure, and plus the Fed's not done raising rates yet. We still probably are going to expect another one on Wednesday. And after that, for June, nobody's really sure whether the Fed's going to have to raise rates again or take a pause. There's still a lot of uncertainty out there. For now though, I think everybody's money is safe. How long that's going to last? I'm not positive.\n\nTaylor Wilson: Medora Lee, thanks as always.\n\nMedora Lee: Okay, thanks Taylor. Have a good day.\n\n◆Taylor Wilson: President Joe Biden yesterday summoned House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders to the White House for talks next week on avoiding a default on the nation's debt. Biden's call to McCarthy came just an hour after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the federal government may not be able to pay its bills as soon as June 1st. Biden has been under pressure to talk to McCarthy after House Republicans passed a bill to raise the debt limit while cutting spending. Biden has maintained that the debt limit be raised without conditions.\n\n◆Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a measure making child rape subject to the death penalty, defying a US Supreme Court ruling. At a press conference, he said that in the worst of the worst cases, the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate punishment. In 2008, Supreme Court Justices issued a five-four ruling barring states from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child when the crime does not involve a child's death. The court ruled that applying the death penalty in such cases would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. DeSantis though has said he thinks the current conservative majority Supreme Court may be willing to revisit the earlier ruling.\n\n◆Montana State Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr is suing Republican leadership after they voted to censure her for comments she made criticizing colleagues over a bill restricting gender-affirming healthcare. The first openly transgender woman elected to Montana's legislature tweeted yesterday that recent actions violate her First Amendment rights as well as those of her constituents. The American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, along with several attorneys, filed the suit on her behalf in state court yesterday against the state of Montana. The Press Secretary for Montana Department of Justice Attorney General, Austin Knudsen, called the suit, \"performance litigation.\"\n\n◆It was a glamorous night at the Met Gala, and this year's theme recognized the work of late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. I spoke with USA TODAY Now Editor Anika Reed to hear all about it. Hi Anika, thanks for hopping on the show.\n\nAnika Reed: Hi, thank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson: So let's start here for those who maybe don't know, what is the Met Gala?\n\nAnika Reed: So the Met Gala is also referred to as fashion's biggest night. If you're a sports fan, think of it as the Super Bowl of fashion. If you're an entertainment fan, think of it as the Oscars of fashion. Basically, the biggest event that you can think of having to do with fashion and art and history all combined into one. It's actually an invite-only fundraiser that helps the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Costume Institute, and it's held annually. Typically, it's on the first Monday in May. We had a little bit of a blip in the system with the pandemic and having it not be held on the first Monday in May for a couple of years, but we returned last year and we're back again this year.\n\nThe Met Gala is basically every major celebrity who you can think of dressing up, having to do with a theme, and this year's theme was Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty. And yeah, this year's Met Gala was a huge showcase of fashion and legacy and the art that is design.\n\nTaylor Wilson: And the celebrities who showed up, did they stay on theme with the Karl Lagerfeld theme for the most part?\n\nAnika Reed: For the most part, absolutely. I think a lot of the invitees had a personal connection to Karl. And that being said, they wanted to honor him, honor his legacy. He died a few years ago and this exhibit really looks back at his entire career in fashion, and so we saw a lot of black and white, kind of nods to his typical suiting that he would wear. We saw a lot of pearls. We saw some gold and a lot of black and white. So, looking at some of the Chanel bride dresses and some archival pieces from people. So I'd say for the most part, yes, everyone stayed on theme, including Rihanna, who closed out the carpet and was wearing basically a giant Chanel-esque flower as her look, and was stunning.\n\nTaylor Wilson: Yeah, absolutely massive look from Rihanna. What were some of the other big outfits on the night from celebrities?\n\nAnika Reed: One of the big looks was Kim Kardashian. She was wearing Schiaparelli and she stopped and talked to us for a minute on the carpet. She just wanted to pay honor and tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, as I said, a personal connection there. Everyone from Dua Lipa, who was one of the co-chairs of the event, she showed up in a gorgeous white gown. White was definitely a big hit on the carpet this year. You had Gisele Bündchen in this huge feathery cape almost, all white as well. You had Diddy who was wearing a Sean John original, big black cape. He came with Yung Miami as his date. Anyone who you can think of, Usher was there, Russell Westbrook was there. Tom Ford was there. Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, anyone who you can think of was probably there.\n\nTaylor Wilson: All right, Anika Reed, thanks so much.\n\nAnika Reed: Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson: Before we go, happy National Teacher Appreciation Day. If you have a chance, say thanks today to the teacher in your life. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us every morning right here wherever you get your audio. I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/15/bank-safe-collapse-protect-money-svb/11474023002/", "title": "Is my bank safe from collapse? How to protect your money in the bank", "text": "More people are wondering just how safe their money is in a bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\nOnline searches asking that question have jumped as Americans worry their bank could be the next to fail.\n\nThat fear hasn't subsided even after major U.S. banks injected more than $30 billion of deposits in First Republic Bank last week and UBS bought Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse over the weekend.\n\nExperts say there’s no reason customers should worry about money kept in banks that are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, especially since very few depositors surpass the $250,000 limit on the insurance.\n\nAnd with Signature and SVB, the government took extraordinary steps to insure deposits above that limit.\n\nClark Kendall, president and CEO of Kendall Capital, a wealth management firm, said the government's actions set a precedent for any other bank failures. \"The FDIC will now step up and ensure all depositors,\" he thinks.\n\nWhat caused the SVB collapse?\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's collapse was tied to faltering tech stocks and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe bank’s customers – mostly startups and other tech companies – were in need of cash after venture capital funding started to decline. Those customers began withdrawing their SVB deposits to pay their expenses.\n\nSVB didn't anticipate so many withdrawals at the same time. And when that occurred, the bank was ill-prepared with minimal deposits on hand and most of its money tied up in U.S. Treasuries.\n\nNormally, this is considered a safe long-term investment, but the Fed’s interest rate hikes made the value of the Treasuries tumble.\n\nSVB had to start selling those bonds at a loss to meet withdrawal requests, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nLast week, the bank said that it suffered a $1.8 billion after-tax loss and would sell $2.25 billion in new shares, which spooked investors. The bank's stock plummeted and depositors moved to take out more money than the bank could provide. Two days later, regulators seized the bank’s assets.\n\nOpinion:SVB's failure poses serious challenge for America's innovation economy\n\nOpinion:Blaming Silicon Valley Bank collapse on diversity or 'wokeness' gives away Republican game\n\nA week after the FDIC took over SVB, its parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nHow is this different from 2008 bank collapses?\n\nWhile SVB's meltdown and the stress rippling through the banking system may stir memories of the 2008 financial crisis, it has little in common with the earlier episode.\n\nThe 2008 crisis enveloped the entire housing market, threatened the survival of the nation’s biggest banks, and threw the economy into its worst downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nIn the early 2000s, banks approved subprime mortgages for unqualified borrowers who couldn’t refinance or repay the loans when the housing bubble burst. As house prices fell further, the pain quickly spread to more traditional borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages and to banks that had bundled the mortgages into securities and sold them to other investment firms.\n\nWith the value of those securities plunging, banks virtually halted lending, millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, nearly 9 million workers lost their jobs and nearly $20 trillion in household wealth was wiped out.\n\nThe current crisis began with a single regional bank that disproportionately served tech companies.\n\nA second bank, Signature Bank, also had to shut down and the stress spread to other regional banks with concentrated portfolios. But it generally has not imperiled larger, more diversified banks, said Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon.\n\nAnd while SVB had to cope with “interest rate risk,” which ultimately led to its demise, banks in 2008 faced “credit risk” – the more serious hazard of loan defaults, Daco said.\n\nAnother key difference is commercial banks have a far bigger capital cushion to withstand losses today, with cash comprising 14% of their assets, compared with 3% at the start of the financial crisis, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist of LPL Financial.\n\nThe values of those assets, largely Treasury bonds, are known. That is unlike the underlying value of mortgage securities in 2008, Daco said.\n\nAnd this time, regulators moved within two days to guarantee that deposit holders at SVB, Signature, and other banks could access all their money, Daco said. In 2008, it took federal agencies months after the failure of Bear Stearns and IndyMac Bank to set up their most sweeping rescue programs.\n\nHundreds of banks failed in the 2008 crisis, versus two so far in the SVB episode. And the current crisis will cause banks to pull back on lending but not nearly as much as in 2008, economists say.\n\n“Unlike in 2008, the government is getting ahead of the problem rather than trying to clean up afterward,” says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network. “We are not set for a rerun of the Great Financial Crisis.”\n\nHow does FDIC insurance work?\n\nThe FDIC covers up to $250,000 worth of deposits at FDIC-insured banks.\n\nThe $250,000 limit is per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, with the exception of some accounts including, investment accounts, life insurance policies, and safe deposit boxes or their contents.\n\nHere are some of the types of accounts the FDIC does insure:\n\nChecking accounts\n\nSavings accounts\n\nNegotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts\n\nMoney market deposit accounts (MMDA)\n\nCertificates of deposits (CDs) and other time deposits\n\nCashier’s checks, money orders, and other official items issued by banks\n\nDeposits above $250,000 may be protected as well.\n\nShould you pull money out of the bank?\n\n“Every American should know that their accounts are safe and their deposits are protected,\" said Jeff Sigmund, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association. \"Our industry will work with the administration, regulators, and Congress to further bolster that trust,” Sigmund said.\n\nThe National Bankers Association, which promotes minority-owned financial institutions, issued a statement Monday to assure customers that their deposits are safe at banks.\n\n“Minority depository institutions are very different from both SVB and Signature Bank which had high concentrations in crypto deposits and volatile venture capital,” President and CEO Nicole Elam said in a release. “Minority banks are not exposed to riskier asset classes and have the capital and strong liquidity to best serve consumers and small businesses.”\n\nDavid Sacco, an instructor in finance and economics at the University of New Haven's Pompea College of Business and a former fixed-income trader, said most banks are \"in better shape than they've been in in a long time.\"\n\n“Anything could happen. But I am significantly less worried that this is going to spread in terms of bigger banks having the same problem,\" he said.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department that supervises national banks, said it has heightened monitoring and is coordinating with other U.S. regulatory agencies to make sure the federal banking system retains the trust of consumers, businesses and communities.\n\n“The OCC remains committed to ensuring that national banks remain safe and sound, provide fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly,” a statement from the bureau said.\n\nWhich banks are safe from collapse?\n\nThe Financial Stability Board, an international organization that was created after the 2008 crisis, maintains a list of banks that are colloquially considered \"too big to fail.\"\n\nIn addition, the U.S. created a Financial Stability Oversight Council after the crisis to determine which banks are systemically important to the banking stability in the country. The Council and FSB place unique restrictions on these banks, for instance, how much of depositors' money they can lend out and how much cash they need to have on hand.\n\nThe restrictions are designed to add an extra layer of protection beyond what the banks would do if left to their own devices, according to the architects of the post-2008 regulations. That's not to say that these banks can't run into trouble but it's safe to say the government wouldn't allow them to collapse because it would pose so much danger to the overall financial stability of the country.\n\nOn the top of the list is JPMorgan, the nation's biggest bank. It didn't respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment regarding if its customers' deposits are safe with them. Citibank, the nation's third-largest bank, declined to comment.\n\nCharles Schwab also declined to comment but pointed to a Monday report that noted more than 80% of its total bank deposits fall within FDIC insurance limits. In comparison, 6% of total domestic deposits were insured at Silicon Valley Bank, according to S&P Global.\n\nAlly Bank told USA TODAY that \"nearly 90% of our customer deposits are fully insured (by the FDIC).\"\n\nPNC Bank said its \"strong capital and liquidity levels position us well to continue supporting our customers regardless of the economic environment.\"\n\nWells Fargo declined to comment. First Republic Bank, Capital One, and Bank of America didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhat happened to Credit Suisse?\n\nCredit Suisse, a global bank based in Switzerland, had been under stress before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. SVB's collapse amplified the troubles Credit Suisse was facing as its stock plunged.\n\nCredit Suisse desperately needed more cash to alleviate customers' anxieties. So the Swiss central bank provided a lifeline of around $54 billion Thursday morning.\n\nThen over the weekend Credit Suisse's rival, UBS, agreed to buy it for $3.2 billion in an effort to restore banking stability.\n\nHow to protect your money\n\nYou can do a number of things to ensure all of your money is safe in the unlikely event that your bank collapses.\n\nYou can open multiple accounts at different banks, the FDIC says.. You can also open a joint checking account which would insure up to a total of $500,000 in the account ($250,000 per person).\n\n“No one needs to worry about losing their deposits as long as they're in a bank that's got that FDIC symbol somewhere on their logo,” Sacco said. “You definitely don't have to panic.\"\n\nDig deeper:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/27/first-citizens-silicon-valley-bank/11548475002/", "title": "First Citizens to acquire Silicon Valley Bank amid turmoil", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK – North Carolina-based First Citizens will buy Silicon Valley Bank, the tech industry-focused financial institution that collapsed earlier this month, rattling the banking industry and sending shockwaves around the world.\n\nThe deal could reassure investors at a time of shaken confidence in banks, though the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and other regulators had already taken extraordinary steps to head off a wider banking crisis by guaranteeing that depositors in Silicon Valley Bank and another failed U.S. bank would be able to access all of their money.\n\nCustomers of Silicon Valley will automatically become customers of First Citizens, which is headquartered in Raleigh. The 17 former branches of Silicon Valley will open as First Citizens branches Monday, the FDIC said.\n\nNasdaq-traded shares of First Citizen BancShares Inc. jumped 12.4% to $654.95 in premarket trading Monday. Shares in midsized San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which serves a similar clientele as Silicon Valley Bank and had appeared to be facing a similar crisis, surged 24.3% in premarket trading.\n\nSVB aftermath:Banks may be hiking savings rates to hold on to customers amid crisis\n\nSVB depositors vs. student loan debitors:Does one group matter more than the other?\n\nEuropean shares opened higher Monday, with German lender Commerzbank AG up 2.4% and BNP Paribas up 1.2%.\n\nInvestors worry that other banks also may crumble under the pressure of higher interest rates. On Friday, much of the focus was on Deutsche Bank, whose stock tumbled 8.5% in Germany, though it was back up about 3.6% in early trading Monday. Earlier this month, shares of and faith in Swiss bank Credit Suisse fell so much that regulators brokered a takeover by rival UBS.\n\nWhat happened to SVB?\n\nIn the U.S., Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, collapsed on March 10 after depositors rushed to withdraw money amid fears about the bank’s health. It was the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history after the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual. Two days later, New York-based Signature Bank was seized by regulators in the third-largest bank failure in the U.S.\n\nIn both cases, the government agreed to cover deposits, even those that exceeded the federally insured limit of $250,000, so depositors were able to access their money.\n\nHow did other banks respond to SVB crisis?\n\nNew York Community Bank agreed to buy a significant chunk of Signature Bank in a $2.7 billion deal a week ago, but the search for a buyer for Silicon Valley took longer.\n\nAfter First Republic Bank came under heavy selling by panicked investors, 11 of the biggest banks in the country announced a $30 billion rescue package. The money has given First Republic a lifeline while it reportedly seeks a buyer.\n\nThe sale of Silicon Valley Bank announced late Sunday involves the sale of all deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bank to First-Citizens Bank and Trust Co., the FDIC said.\n\nThe acquisition gives the FDIC shares in First Citizens worth $500 million. Both the FDIC and First Citizens will share in losses and the potential recovery on loans included in a loss-share agreement, the FDIC said.\n\nThe FDIC will retain about $90 billion of Silicon Valley Bank's $167 billion in total assets, as of March 10, while First Citizens will acquire $72 billion at a discount of $16.5 billion, the FDIC said. It said it estimates Silicon Valley Bank's failure will cost its industry-funded Deposit Insurance Fund about $20 billion.\n\nFirst Citizens Bank was founded in 1898 and says it has more than $100 billion in total assets, with more than 500 branches in 21 states as well as a nationwide bank. It reported a net profit of $243 million in the last quarter. It is one of the top 20 U.S. banks and says it is the largest family-controlled bank in the country.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2023/03/10/fdic-silicon-valley-bank-fail/11445464002/", "title": "Silicon Valley Bank failed. The FDIC took it over: what that means", "text": "FTX and Silicon Valley Bank have one big thing in common: They failed. But those who deposited money with SVB were able to sleep a lot better Friday night after the bank was ordered to shut down than many FTX customers were.\n\nThat's because many of SVB customers' deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), unlike FTX customers who haven't been able to access money in their accounts since the cryptocurrency exchange site declared bankruptcy.\n\nSVB's demise came after its customers, most of them technology workers and venture-capital-backed companies, began withdrawing their money as anxiety about the bank's financial stability spread this week.\n\nSVB market impact:Silicon Valley Bank's troubles are sending First Republic Bank, other bank stocks lower\n\nSVB collapse:Silicon Valley Bank assets seized by FDIC in largest bank failure since 2008\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nThe FDIC announced Friday afternoon that customers who had up to $250,000 per account deposited with SVB, which was the nation's 16th-largest bank, will have access to their funds by Monday morning. Customers with accounts in excess of $250,000 were instructed to call the FDIC at 1-866-799-0959.\n\nWhat's the FDIC?\n\nThe reason many SVB customers will have access to at least $250,000 of their deposits immediately is the financial institution backed by the FDIC.\n\nThe FDIC is an independent branch of the government that was created during the Great Depression to restore the public's confidence in banks. During the Great Depression, many banks failed partly because they had lent out too much of the money customers deposited with them.\n\nAt a basic level, banks make money by charging interest to lend money to people. But the money they lend often comes from customers' deposits. That isn't problematic unless the bank finds itself in a situation when every customer wants to withdraw their deposits at once in what's known as a bank run.\n\nThe bank would have to tell many customers it doesn't have their money because it was lent out. That's probably what would have happened to SVB customers if the bank wasn't a member of the FDIC.\n\nWhen banks are members of the FDIC, they have to adhere to the agency's regulations designed to make sure they aren't engaging in dangerous practices that could jeopardize their customers' deposits. In exchange, the FDIC offers their customers insurance for up to $250,000 in deposits if the bank fails.\n\nFDIC takeover\n\nIf an FDIC-insured bank can't pull itself from the brink of collapse, the FDIC will step in and try to help sell its remaining assets to a healthy bank. But when there are no buyers, the FDIC will take over the failing bank and pay its depositors up to the insured limit.\n\nThat's what the agency did with SVB on Friday.\n\nWhen the FDIC takes over a bank, it gains control of all its assets by creating a new quasi-bank. In this instance, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara to receive all of SVB's assets and sell them as needed so that as many depositors as possible can get their money.\n\nFDIC bank failures\n\nFDIC-bank failures are rare. SVB is the first bank to fail since 2020.\n\nThat should be \"a wake-up call for people to always make sure their money is at an FDIC-insured bank and within FDIC limits and following the FDIC's rules,\" Bankrate analyst Matthew Goldberg said in a statement Friday.\n\nSince 2000, there have been more than 500 bank failures, according to the FDIC. As of December 2022, there were more than 4,700 FDIC-insured financial institutions.\n\nGovernment bailouts:The government has often intervened when an industry is in crisis\n\nIs your money safe in a bank?

But it wasn't known at the time what would happen to deposits that exceeded $250,000, the limit the FDIC insures in the event of a bank failure.\n\nRipple effect:How Silicon Valley Bank collapse is affecting other US banks\n\nSilicon Valley Bank:Regulators offer plan to 'ensure U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles'\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nAre your savings safe? What to know about saving accounts\n\nOver the weekend, the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and FDIC announced that SVB and Signature Bank's failures posed a big enough risk to the entire banking system that it merited allowing regulators to take the unusual step of guaranteeing the larger deposits.\n\nBut the saga doesn't end there. Here's what we know so far:\n\nSEC and DOJ are investigating SVB collapse\n\nThe Justice Department has begun a preliminary inquiry into the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday.\n\nThe review is in its early stages, said the person who is not authorized to comment publicly, declining to elaborate on the scope of the inquiry. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to inquiries.\n\nJustice’s involvement as well as a preliminary investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n–Kevin Johnson\n\nOpinion:SVB's failure poses serious challenge for America's innovation economy\n\nOpinion:Blaming Silicon Valley Bank collapse on diversity or 'wokeness' gives away Republican game\n\nIs the government bailing out SVB?\n\nIt may appear way since the government is guaranteeing all the deposits at both of the failed banks.\n\nSeparately, the Fed said it will provide financing by offering loans of up to a year to eligible banks and other financial institutions. The move is intended to prevent a wave of bank runs that would threaten the stability of the banking system and the economy as a whole.\n\nBut President Joe Biden stressed yesterday that \"no losses\" stemming from the collapse of the Silicon Valley and Signature banks would be borne by taxpayers. He said he would ask Congress and federal regulators to tighten banking rules to make it less likely that a major failure happens again.\n\n–Francesca Chambers and Amritpal Kaur Sandhu-Longoria\n\nBanking crisis:President Joe Biden says taxpayer money won't be used to bail out SVB, Signature Bank\n\nWhy was there a run on SVB?\n\nBillionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel is seen as having accelerated SVB’s fall after talk circulated Thursday that his Founders Fund venture capital firm asked its companies to move their funds.\n\nVC firms Coatue Management, Union Square Ventures and Founder Collective also reportedly had advised their portfolio companies to pull their money from the bank, while Canaan told its portfolio companies to remove their cash on an as-needed basis, reports said.\n\nThis set off panic across Silicon Valley, prompting SVB’s CEO on Thursday to hold a conference call with clients asking them to remain calm.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nWhat companies are affected by SVB collapse?\n\nIn addition to Etsy, online game platform Roblox on Friday said it had about 5% of its $3 billion in cash at Silicon Valley Bank, and said the collapse would have “no impact” on its day-to-day operations. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nStreaming platform company Roku said in a regulatory filing Friday that it had about a quarter of its $1.9 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents held in Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nRoblox and Roku declined to comment further Monday.\n\n–Bailey Schulz\n\nWho is affected by Silicon Valley Bank's failure?\n\nTech and crypto businesses.\n\n“The fact that the collapses have principally been in the tech and crypto spaces suggests that these sectors are even more at risk than the economy as a whole” wrote Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at broker-dealer Commonwealth Financial Network. “While other banks will likely move to replace SVB, they will not be as focused or as dedicated to the sector, which will slow things down going forward. One of the primary enablers of the tech boom is now gone.”\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nWhy did Signature Bank fail?\n\nSignature Bank, a New York-based financial institution that became a big lender in the crypto industry, was ordered to close over the weekend. The bank was part of only a handful of financial institutions allowing customers to deposit crypto assets.\n\nThat didn't bode well for the bank when crypto plunged as a result of FTX's collapse last year.\n\nSignature board member Barney Frank, a former congressman who helped design new financial regulations after the 2008 financial crisis, ultimately blamed SVB for its collapse. “It was an SVB-generated panic,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “We were fine until the last couple of hours on Friday.”\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nLargest U.S. banks\n\nAs regional banks, those with between $10 billion and $100 billion in assets, are under pressure amid Signature Bank and SVB's fallout, deposits are rushing into the largest banks in the U.S., Bloomberg reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nHere are the biggest banks in the U.S.:\n\nWhat does the Silicon Valley Bank collapse mean?\n\nEven if you didn't have money deposited in SVB, the bank's failure, the first since 2020 and the second largest on record, matters for the entire U.S. banking system.\n\nBefore last week, there was little reason to suspect that you couldn't withdraw as much money from your bank account as you'd like at any given time.\n\nBut as panicked customers rushed to SVB branches and crashed the bank's site once it became apparent that it was in trouble, many began to wonder if their money was safe where it was deposited.\n\nThat fear directly flowed to Signature Bank, contributing to its collapse on Sunday.\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWSJ SVB diversity\n\nA Wall Street Journal opinion piece written by Andy Kessler is getting a lot of backlash. In his piece, Kessler lays out the reasons why he believes SVB failed. Among them, he suggests \"the company may have been distracted by diversity demands.\"\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nFirst Republic Bank stock\n\nShares of First Republic Bank are up over 50% in premarket trading Tuesday morning. The bank has taken a big hit in recent days as depositors pull money from their accounts.\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nFirst Republic Bank, Western Alliance under downgrade credit review\n\nCredit rating agency Moody's announced last night it's putting First Republic Bank, Western Alliance and four other banks under review for a credit downgrade. If Moody's goes through with downgrading the banks it could amplify the dangers they are facing in the aftermath of the SVB and Signature Bank collapses.\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nSilicon Valley Bank failure explained\n\nSilicon Valley's customers, who were largely startups and other tech-centric companies, started becoming needier for cash over the past year. That led them to withdraw money from their accounts.\n\nSVB meanwhile needed to keep selling its assets, mainly bonds, at a loss to free up capital so that customers could withdraw funds. But the bank got to a point where the losses were so high, customers began to fear SVB couldn't guarantee access to every customer's funds. That fueled a massive bank run which caused the FDIC to step in.\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'A brutal day':How Silicon Valley Bank's failure shook businesses from wine country to London\n\nFDIC insurance explained:Silicon Valley Bank failed. FDIC covers some of the money, but only up to $250,000\n\nHow fast did SVB shares fall?\n\nSVB shares declined swiftly, plunging from $267.8 billion at 4 pm on March 8 to $106 billion 24 hours later. The bank was among the biggest in the U.S. banks in terms of assets.\n\nHow much did SVB have in deposits?\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, Silicon Valley Bank had approximately $209.0 billion in total assets and about $175.4 billion in total deposits, according to the FDIC on Sunday.\n\n“At the time of closing, the amount of deposits in excess of the insurance limits was undetermined,” it said.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nThe top three bank failures in U.S. history are:\n\nWashington Mutual, Seattle, Washington: in 2008, with nominal assets at time of failure of $307 billion. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Santa Clara, California: in 2023, with nominal assets of $209 billion. Signature Bank, New York, New York: in 2023, with nominal assets of $118 billion.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nWho is buying Silicon Valley Bank?\n\nEarly reports suggested PNC Financial, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Canada were among the suitors for the failed SVB bank, but more recent reports have said PNC has declined and interest from RBC has cooled.\n\nFor a mid-sized regional bank, \"buying the whole bank would be a very large transaction and a big shift in focus to one area although Silicon Valley is known for very strong relationships in this business,\" wrote Vivek Juneja, JPMorgan analyst.\n\nAs for Signature Bank, Juneja noted \"Signature Bank had ties to the crypto industry, which may limit its appeal to...potential buyers.\"\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nEtsy payments delayed\n\nE-commerce company Etsy, which delayed payments to about 0.5% of its active sellers on Friday after SVB's collapse, said in a statement that it was working to pay those sellers Monday.\n\n“We’ve already started processing payments via another payment partner this morning,” the statement reads. “Supporting our sellers is our highest priority, and we understand how important it is for these small businesses to be able to receive their funds when they need them.”\n\n–Bailey Schulz\n\nBiden blames Trump for SVB failure\n\nPresident Joe Biden pointed fingers at the Trump administration for the collapse of SVB.\n\n\"During the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank Law, to make sure the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again,\" he said during a White House address on Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the last administration rolled back some of these requirements,\" he said, referring to measures former President Donald Trump signed into law in 2018 aimed at helping small and midsize banks compete with larger banks by easing restrictions\n\n\"I’m going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely that this kind of bank failure will happen again and to protect American jobs and small businesses.\"\n\n–Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBank term funding program (BTFP): What is it?\n\nThat's a facility created by the Federal Reserve that allows banks to offer high quality securities such as Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as collateral for cash at par value, meaning banks can monetize these securities holdings well above the market value.\n\nA problem for SVB was that when companies began withdrawing large amounts of money to fund their businesses, it had to sell its longer-term Treasuries and securities at a loss to cover the withdrawals. The market value of the securities had dropped sharply amid high inflation and aggressive Fed rate hikes to slow it.\n\nBecause SVB had to take such a huge loss on the securities, it no longer had enough assets to cover its deposits.\n\nThe BTFP “will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution’s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress,” the Fed said.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nBank failures: What does it mean for overseas markets?\n\nEuropean markets slid amid banking concerns as financiers pulled an all-nighter to rescue SVB’s U.K. arm. In the end, HSBC UK acquired SVB U.K. for £1 ($1.21), in a deal that excludes the assets and liabilities of SVB U.K.’s parent company. That allowed customers of SVB U.K. to bank as usual.\n\nThere were also \"a large number of startups and investors\" who had \"significant exposure to SVB UK,\" Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, which represents British startups, said on Twitter. He cited \"concern and panic.\"\n\nAsian stocks were mixed.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nWhat’s the 'moral hazard'?\n\n“This has created a moral hazard for the Fed; there will be an expectation for it to step in even if a bank gets into trouble in the future for any other issues,” wrote JP Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja.\n\nBut most economists agree with former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers who said in an interview on Friday “I don’t think this is a time for moral-hazard lectures or for talk about teaching people lessons.\"\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nIs the U.S. Treasury also providing support?\n\nYes, the Treasury is backstopping the Fed, which is allowing banks to use their high-grade securities as collateral at face value for cash for one year. The Treasury will make up to $25 billion available as a credit-risk backstop to the Fed.\n\nFed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nFed interest rate decision: Will SVB, Signature Bank cause Fed to pause rate hike?\n\nMost economists say no, but it could at least slow down the Fed’s interest rate plan to cool inflation.\n\nSome economists are betting the Fed will pause its aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes because of the risks the Silicon Valley Bank crisis poses to the financial system. Others say the central bank is still laser-focused on fighting inflation and will follow through with a rate increase next week, though probably by a quarter point rather than a half point.\n\nThe bank failures have tightened lending for now, and if it continues, it does some of the Fed’s work to slow the economy.\n\nHowever, this also could pull forward the timeline for a recession, which many economists predicted in the latter part of the year.\n\n“Expect to see banks and the financial sector as a whole pull back on lending and risk until they get their houses in order, and this will slow economic growth and likely pull markets down.” Commonwealth chief investment officer Brad McMillan wrote. “In some respects, this is good (it is what the Fed has been aiming for), but it makes a recession much more likely, quite possibly in the short term.”\n\n–Medora Lee and Paul Davidson\n\nFed launches review of supervision and regulation of SVB\n\nThe Fed plans to “conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience,\" said Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr.\n\nThe “thorough, transparent, and swift review” will be publicly released by May 1, the Fed said.\n\n–Medora Lee\n\nVice President Kamala Harris weighs in on SVB\n\nVice President Harris offered her own statement on Twitter just before 6 p.m. ET, bookending a day that started with a statement from President Biden on the bank failures and looming crisis. She wrote that the president \"was clear: The banking system is safe, small businesses can access their money when they need it, and we will hold accountable those responsible.\"\n\n– Michelle Maltais", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/03/fed-interest-rate-hike-live-updates/70170191007/", "title": "Fed hikes interest rate, signals pause in its inflation fight", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Fed’s most aggressive rate-hiking campaign in 40 years may be history.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday and signaled it could now pause if inflation continues to ease as expected.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the central bank removed previous guidance that “some additional policy firming (rate hikes) may be appropriate” to lower yearly inflation to its 2% target.\n\nInstead, it said its policymaking committee “will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy.\n\n“In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the Committee will take into account” its rate hikes so far, the lags with which they affect the economy and inflation, and “economic and financial developments.”\n\nHow the rate hike will impact you:Federal Reserve's on track for one more rate hike. How it affects you and the stock market\n\nSee the surge in rates over time:Credit card, mortgage and auto: See how much Fed interest rates have affected how much you pay\n\nIs a recession coming?:Is a recession coming? Most corporate economists don't see a slump happening within a year.\n\nThe central bank stopped short of stating that rates are probably high enough to lower annual inflation to the Fed’s 2% target, as some economists anticipated. That likely would have been a more emphatic preference for a pause.\n\nStill, if inflation and the labor market show signs of cooling down sufficiently by the Fed’s mid-June meeting, as many economists expect, Fed officials appear inclined to halt the rate increases.\n\nOtherwise, they could bump up rates again despite the growing risk that the moves will trigger a mild recession later this year.\n\n\"Our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference. \"We are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.\"\n\nPowell added the Fed didn't formally decide to pause its rate hikes. But he pointed to the deletion from the statement of the guidance that further rate increases may be appropriate.\n\n\"That's a meaningful change, that we're no longer saying we anticipate\" more hikes.\n\nNew mortgage fees:Mortgage fees are changing for homebuyers next month. Here's what you should know.\n\nWhat happens to home prices?:How will the housing market be affected with the Federal Reserve interest rate hike?\n\nThe Fed repeated that it will also consider the effects of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, which has prompted banks to tighten lending standards and that’s likely “to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain.”\n\nIn other words, if it’s tougher for consumers and businesses to borrow, that could lessen the need for more rate increases.\n\n\"In principle, we won't have to raise rates quite as high as we would have if (the banking crisis) hadn't happened,\" Powell said.\n\nSo has the central bank reached its peak interest rate?\n\n\"We may not be far off and are possibly even at that level,\" he said, adding that will depend on how economic activity and inflation evolve.\n\nAlthough most economists − and the Fed's staff − believe the rate increases will tip the economy into a mild recession this year, Powell said hiring is still so strong it's possible to cool the labor market enough to bring down inflation without triggering a downturn.\n\n\"The case for avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than having a recession,\" he said.\n\nEconomy's growth cools:Economy grew 1.1% in first quarter but a recession could begin soon as high rates bite\n\nWhat is the Fed interest rate now?\n\nWednesday’s hike raises the key rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%, the highest in 17 years. And the Fed got there in near-record time, hoisting the rate from near zero in March 2022 as it sought to beat back inflation that also reached a four-decade high last June as the economy continued to emerge from the pandemic.\n\nAlthough consumer price increases have softened since then, a “core” measure that strips out volatile food and energy items has climbed more than expected this year. That prompted futures markets to predict the Fed would lift rates as high as 5.6% in 2023.\n\nBut the March failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have caused financial institutions to toughen lending standards and Fed officials have said that’s likely to slow the economy and inflation, leaving less work for them to do. This week, First Republic Bank collapsed as well.\n\nFed policymakers also may be hesitant to intensify strains in the financial system considering the rate hikes themselves fueled the crisis by causing big losses at some regional banks heavily invested in rate-sensitive bonds, economists say.\n\nAs a result, the Fed in late March estimated it will raise its key rate to a peak of 5% to 5.25% and then pause.\n\nThe latest hike is expected to further slow economic activity as it drives up rates for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, are finally reaping higher bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nIs the job market slowing down?\n\nThe Fed is trying to walk a fine line as it digests conflicting economic signals. Although March’s 236,000 U.S. job gains were sturdy, monthly payroll increases have slowed significantly from early this year. And the April employment report, due out Friday, is projected to reveal another downshift to180,000 new jobs, according to economists’ estimates.\n\nJob openings declined to 9.6 million in March, a historically elevated total but the lowest in nearly two years, the Labor Department said Tuesday. And since the labor force – which includes people working and job hunting -- has swelled by nearly 2 million people so far this year, the number of vacancies per unemployed worker dropped to 1.6.\n\nThat’s still high but it’s the lowest level since fall 2021 and marks a step toward a better balance between job openings and workers, a goal the Fed is seeking to slow pay increases that may be compounding inflation.\n\nHow is the U.S. economy right now?\n\nOther barometers of economic activity are also moderating, largely due to the rate increases. The nation’s gross domestic product grew at a modest 1.1% annual rate in the first quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up 70% of GDP, increased by a more robust 3.7% but outlays have lost steam since a weather-related surge in January. Manufacturing output also has declined.\n\nA pullback in consumer demand and hiring theoretically should curb inflation but price increases have drifted down just gradually.\n\nWill inflation go down in 2023?\n\nEven as an overall inflation gauge tumbled to 4.2% in March from a peak of 7% in June, the Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation stayed high at 4.6%, according to a government report last week. And a separate report revealed that employee wage growth accelerated slightly in the first quarter.\n\nDoes the Fed plan to raise interest rates again?\n\nBarclays says the Fed could hike again in June if job growth this month tops 200,000 and core inflation increases by about 0.3% or more.\n\nOn the other hand, the central bank is unlikely to cut rates this year, as markets expect, even in the event of a mild recession, Barclays says. It would take a “broad-based financial crisis” or “a very significant shock that hits the economy” to coax the Fed into trimming rates, the research firm says.\n\nPowell said Wednesday that Fed officials believe inflation won't come down quickly, adding, \"In that world... it would not be appropriate to cut rates.\" Fed forecasts don't foresee a move to lower rates until 2024.\n\nSome economists disagree.\n\n\"We expect economic weakness and a sharper-than-expected drop back in core inflation to convince officials to start cutting rates again later this year,\" economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.\n\nS&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq retreat\n\nMajor indexes closed in negative territory after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and Powell said the central bank would monitor the impact of the central bank's increases before determining its next course of action.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed down 0.70%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.80% and the Nasdaq 0.46%.\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin price after Powell speech?\n\nThe Bitcoin price dropped slightly in response to Powell’s speech but remained essentially flat between $28,000 and $28,500, mostly hovering around $28,375.\n\nDespite a surge following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Bitcoin is down substantially from its high in November 2021. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also struggled.\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat are the best interest rates on CDs?\n\nCD rates have been soaring as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Will the latest interest rate hike help you earn even more on your cash savings?\n\nThe best CD rates are exceeding 4.30% annual percentage yields for six-month through five-year terms.\n\nBut with this rate hike possibly being the last for a while, CD rates are expected to level off and may even fall later this year.\n\n− Jessica Guynn\n\nFed meeting calendar\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is June 13-14. Here's a schedule of the remaining meetings for the year:\n\nJuly 25-26\n\nSeptember 19-20\n\nOct/Nov 31-1\n\nDecember 12-13\n\nWhen does the Fed meet to talk rates?The Federal Reserve's 2023 schedule\n\nFed minutes\n\nSeveral weeks after every Fed meeting, it releases what's known as the minutes, a more detailed account of what led the Fed's voting members to their decision on interest rates, as well as a summary of what all was talked about during their two-day meeting. Occasionally, the minutes also give a glimpse of what to expect at the Fed's next gathering.\n\nYou can read the last meeting's minutes here.\n\nMinutes from the April meeting should be released in roughly three weeks. -\n\nWhen does the Fed meet to talk rates? The Federal Reserve's 2023 schedule\n\nHow many Federal Reserve banks are there?\n\nThere are a dozen, and they collectively have twenty-four branches.\n\nHow many banks have failed in 2023?\n\nThree FDIC-insured banks, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and most recently First Republic, have collapsed this year. The FDIC took over SVB and Signature and federal regulators said they would guarantee all depositors, even if their account balances were above the $250,000 limit the FDIC promises to insure. Meanwhile, First Republic was seized Monday and sold to JP Morgan Chase which will incorporate all First Republic accounts and purchase most of that institutions’ assets.\n\nFed rate hike history\n\nAt the Fed's last meeting held March 21 and 22, interest rates inched up 0.25 percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5%.\n\nThe spate of hikes are in sharp contrast to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when rates hovered near zero as the economy largely ground to a halt. In March 2022, the rate was bumped up to a quarter percentage point. In May, it increased by 0.50 percentage point, followed by four hikes in a row of 0.75% percentage point each. The last hike of 2022 was half a percentage point.\n\nWhat is the prime rate?\n\nThe prime rate sets the level of interest consumers with the best credit pay when they borrow from a commercial bank. It's linked to the Federal Reserve which establishes the overnight rate for federal funds. That rate then serves as the basis for the prime rate, which stood at 8% on Wednesday.\n\nWill Fed raise rates again?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to boost its key short-term interest rate 0.25 percentage point today in its ongoing effort to curb inflation.\n\nGood news coming? Fed may hint at a pause in inflation fight\n\nFed rate hike's impact: This is how a Fed rate hike could affect you\n\nWhen is the next Fed rate decision?\n\nThe next Fed interest rate decision will be on June 14th.\n\nFed meeting housing rates\n\nHomeowners who currently have fixed-rate mortgages won’t see any changes. Those who’ve recently purchased a home or are now house hunting are feeling the pinch of higher rates. But mortgage rates have been volatile and are down from their 2023 peak of 6.73% in early March. As of last week, the average rate was 6.43%.\n\nThe Fed can impact mortgage rates but doesn’t directly set them, so even with a rate increase, home loan costs may not rise. The expected rate hike on Wednesday has already lifted the cost of a new average 30-year mortgage by $11,160 over the life of the loan, as rate hikes are usually priced into mortgage rates in advance, according to WalletHub.\n\nHousing:With federal reserve interest rates set to rise, how will the housing market be affected?\n\nBank failures in 2023\n\nFirst Republic was the third bank failure in two months, overtaking Silicon Valley Bank as the second biggest bank collapse in U.S. history.\n\nSVB’s collapse occurred when struggling tech companies with accounts began taking their money out to cover their expenses, leading SVB to sell bonds that were now worth less because of the Fed’s string of rate hikes. The bank run then accelerated as customers with deposits greater than $250,000, which aren't FDIC insured, rushed to withdraw their money amid SVB's capital losses.\n\nSimilar bank runs led to the failure of Signature Bank, which played a key role in the cryptocurrency industry, and put First Republic Bank in jeopardy. First Republic received $30 billion in deposits from JPMorgan Chase and 10 other big banks to keep it afloat but ultimately saw its share price plummet when its quarterly results showed depositors had withdrawn over $100 billion. Regulators seized the bank Monday and sold its accounts and most of its assets to JP Morgan Chase.\n\nFederal regulators also intervened with SVB and Signature banks, taking the unusual step of backing all their deposits including those the FDIC was not obligated to insure because they were greater than $250,000. They also created a lending facility that would enable other regional banks to borrow money to cover withdrawals by uninsured depositors if needed.\n\nA Federal Reserve report noted that lax oversight by regulators contributed to SVB’s failure.\n\nBank failures: How often do they happen?\n\nSVB lobbied Congress for less regulation: Signature Valley Bank wanted fewer regulations\n\nStudent loan borrowers vs. SVB depositors:Who deserves a bailout?\n\nFirst Republic Bank\n\nFirst Republic Bank became the second biggest bank failure in history when federal regulators seized the institution on Monday and JP Morgan Chase committed to acquiring the bank’s customer accounts and most of its assets.\n\nFirst Republic had been on shaky ground after the failures of SVB Bank and Signature Bank in March, with account holders and investors worried that it might meet a similar fate since it also had a large number of uninsured deposits. First Republic had also been a major lender to the wealthy, granting them low interest loans that were now of little value.\n\nEleven larger banks attempted to come to First Republic’s rescue last month, giving it $30 billion. But First Republic revealed in its quarterly report that depositors had withdrawn over $100 billion, a bank run that was accelerated by the ease with which panic can spread through social media.\n\nInvestors fled, sending the bank’s shares plunging 75% last week with the stock price down to $3.51 at the close of markets Friday.\n\nFirst Republic Bank sold: The bank was seized by federal regulators and sold to JP Morgan\n\n− Charisse Jones and Associated Press\n\nWhat is the rate of inflation?\n\nInflation slowed in March, according to a measure favored by the Fed, with consumer prices rising 4.2% as compared to the same month a year ago, which was the smallest uptick since May 2021, according to the Commerce Department. March prices fell from 5.1% the previous month and 7% in June which marked a four-decade high.\n\nCore prices, which don’t count volatile items like food and energy and so offer a clearer snapshot of longer trends, rose 0.3%, lowering the annual increase to 4.6%. That was down from 4.7% in February, a revised figure that ticked upward.\n\nInflation eases: The Fed may slow rate hikes after inflation eases in March\n\nPowell talks inflation: Fed chair testifies before Senate on inflation, speeding up rate hikes\n\nEconomy grew but a recession may still loom:The nation's GDP rose slightly, but high interest rates could still trigger recession\n\nInterest rates today\n\nThe Fed’s rate hike in March lifted its federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.

Sign up here.\n\nPeter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China’s central Henan province. He says he hasn’t been able to access them since April.\n\nThe 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He’s from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China.\n\n“I’m close to having a nervous breakdown. I can’t sleep,” Peter told CNN Business.\n\nWhen he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored.\n\nThe trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.\n\nIn China, local banks are only permitted to obtain deposits from their home customer base, but authorities say that “third-party platforms” were used to acquire funds from depositors outside the region. In Peter’s case, for example, his hometown is over 700 miles away from the banks in Henan.\n\nThe national banking regulator has accused a major shareholder of the four banks of illegally attracting money from savers. “Henan New Fortune Group, a shareholder of the four village banks, has illegally absorbed the public’s funds through internal and external collusion, the use of third-party platforms, and fund brokers,” the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission told state-run Xinhua News Agency in May.\n\nDepositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in February\n\n“The police have opened a case for investigation into the matter,” it added.\n\nRuns on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThere are no official estimates yet on the total amount of funds that bank depositors are unable to withdraw. CNN Business did not receive a comment from the local police or the national banking regulator.\n\nAs many as 400,000 banking customers across China were unable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by Sanlian Lifeweek, a state-owned magazine.\n\nThat’s a drop in the ocean of China’s vast banking system, but about a quarter of the industry’s total assets are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption, say experts, and the sharp economic slowdown.\n\n“The scope of the bank scandals where bank officials embezzle and steal funds from depositors is alarming, and what is exposed could only be the tip of the iceberg,” said Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\n“As the Chinese economy slows down further, the fiscal shortage worsens, and the debt repayments become more widespread among Chinese companies, especially in the real estate sector, bank runs could become more often and on a larger scale,” he said.\n\nMany savers have had enough. Late last month, hundreds of depositors traveled to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, to protest outside the office of the banking regulator and to demand their money back, to no avail.\n\nAnother protest was planned in June. But as the depositors arrived in Zhengzhou, they were stunned to find that their health codes — which were green upon departure — had turned red, according to six people who spoke with CNN and social media posts. Anyone with a red code — usually assigned to people infected with Covid or deemed by authorities to be at high risk of infection — immediately becomes persona non grata.\n\nThey are banned from all public venues and transport and are often subject to weeks of government quarantine.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Zhengzhou government for comment. The Henan Provincial Health Commission told state-run news website thepaper.cn it was “investigating and verifying” the complaints from depositors who received red codes.\n\nWhat’s behind the problem in Henan\n\nIn Henan, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has put the blame on the private investment firm that holds large stakes in all four lenders.\n\nLast week, the Henan police said that a criminal gang headed by the investment firm’s controller “has been suspected of using village banks to commit serious crimes.” Police say several suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe Henan New Fortune Group no longer has a website. CNN tried to reach the company for comment on the phone and by email without success. The company has made no public statements and it’s believed to have been annulled.\n\nLater on Monday, the four Henan banks said they would start collecting information from customers who have been affected by the shutdown of their online transaction systems. The move was required by financial regulators, the banks added in separate statements on their website, without elaborating further.\n\nThat’s of little comfort to the banks’ customers. Deposits up to 500,000 yuan (almost $75,000) are guaranteed in the event of bank failures, but that’s not enough for some — like Peter — and if the government’s investigation finds that their savings are “non-compliant” transactions, they could lose everything.\n\n“I’m quite worried about how they [authorities] are going to deal with our money,” said Ye, who asked CNN Business to only use his surname. Ye is a 30-year old tech worker from the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province — about 1500 km (900 miles) from the banks he used in Henan. He said he has a total of 160,000 yuan (about $24,000) worth of deposits with them.\n\n“We were told by the banks that the deposit products were legal, and that they were protected by the deposit insurance scheme,” he said. “We just want to get our money back.”\n\nThe four banks — Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng — have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nRisky liabilities\n\nIn early 2021, Beijing banned banks from selling deposit products via third party online platforms, fearing that the rapid expansion of the fintech sector could increase risks in the wider financial system. The People’s Bank of China called such practices “illegal financial activities.”\n\nSo why were small local banks in Henan apparently ignoring the ban and raising deposits from savers — like Ye, who live on the other side of the country?\n\nChina’s national banking and insurance regulator says third party online platforms allowed them to bypass these geographical restrictions and grow their business nationwide.\n\nIn the Henan case, various state-run media are reporting that the deposit products were sold via platforms affiliated with, or owned by, giants of China’s tech scene such as Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com. (JD)\n\nThose platforms — Du Xiaoman Financial, which is the financial affiliate of Baidu, as well as JD Finance — have not responded to requests for comment.\n\n“The central government regulators seem to be incapable of enforcing those regulations aimed at preventing this kind of bank run from occurring,” said Frank Xie, the Chinese economy expert. He added that corruption was “rampant” at local levels of financial institutions.\n\n“Perpetrators such as the person stealing millions from the depositors often get shielded by accomplices in governments and in the upper-level management of the banks,” Xie said.\n\n“The core problem is that China’s financial system simply expanded far too fast relative to the size of the economy over the previous decade,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.\n\nChina’s banking sector has increased sixfold in size since 2008, with total assets reaching over $50 trillion, according to government statistics.\n\nThe funding structure of small lenders also makes them more risky, say experts.\n\nCompared with big banks, they are more reliant on deposits for funding. Many of them offer high interest rates to attract commercial and interbank deposits. But as the slowing economy means borrowers struggle to repay the banks, it becomes difficult for them to deliver the returns they offered savers.\n\n“The funding structure of liabilities in many of China’s mostly smaller and regional banks is most likely still vulnerable to deposit runs, lender caution, and deteriorating economic performance and rising unemployment,” said George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University and former chief economist at UBS.\n\nDeteriorating financial health\n\nThe Henan crisis arrived at a time when public confidence in China’s banking system was already waning.\n\nIn the past decade, Beijing has been clamping down on “shadow banking” activities — which means unregulated, off-the-book lending by financial institutions — on worries that most of the funds had been diverted to property developers and local government infrastructure projects, leading to a rapid run-up in debt and growing financial risks.\n\nIn 2019, China seized control of Baoshang Bank, based in Inner Mongolia, citing serious credit risks posed by the lender.\n\nIt was the first bank seizure in China in more than 20 years and the lender was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe following year, there were at least five bank runs at small lenders, mostly triggered by public fears following reports of financial distress at the banks or anti-graft investigations into bank executives.\n\n“Financial institutions are still grappling with some of the losses that have resulted, particularly in China’s northeast, central provinces, and western regions, where shadow banking activities had expanded the fastest over the past decade,” Wright said.\n\nMaking matters worse, “the ongoing slowdowns in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic have further exposed financial institutions to new credit risks as well,” Wright added.\n\nSpillover effects\n\nInvestors are closely watching the government’s investigation into the Henan bank run. Analysts are gauging possible spillover effects to other banks.\n\n“The economy is a key reason why affected banks might be experiencing difficulties, and it is quite possible that other banks will be affected, perhaps even larger banks, given that the fate of the property market and real estate prices hang in the balance,” said Magnus from Oxford University.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling with the country’s zero-Covid policy. Many cities have been placed under full or partial lockdowns since March, wreaking havoc on activity. Analysts are worried that the economy could contract in the second quarter.\n\n“This could have multiplier effects given that real estate as an asset class could be compromised now for a few years,” Magnus said.\n\nChina’s gigantic real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, is in a worsening downturn. Sales by the country’s top 100 developers collapsed 59% in May from a year ago, according to a recent survey by property research firm Cric China.\n\nEvergrande — one of the country’s biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande’s collapse could have ripple effects across the property industry and spill over to the financial system.\n\nProperty loans accounts for nearly 30% of outstanding loans with China’s financial institutions.\n\nAnalysts aren’t yet worrying about a financial crisis — because the PBOC is likely to ensure that larger and systemically more important banks are protected.\n\nBut the discontent triggered by the bank runs could be a major concern for the government.\n\nWhen Covid health codes of depositors turned red early last week, derailing a planned protest in Zhengzhou, it sparked a massive outcry on social media.\n\n“Now (the authorities) can stop you from petitioning by directly putting digital shackles on you, aka giving you red codes,” said one comment on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.\n\nDozens of depositors were taken into a quarantine hotel guarded by police and local officials, before being sent away on trains bound for their hometowns the next day; others were “quarantined” at several other locations in the city, including a college campus, according to the witnesses and online posts.\n\n“Many people lost their lifetime savings because of this and [if] more incidences like this takes place, and [if] a bank run is met with a government crackdown, social unrest will be the only end result,” Xie said.\n\n— Nectar Gan, CNN’s Beijing bureau, and Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/02/09/banks-fell-great-recession-but-they-stronger-now/913787001/", "title": "Banks fell in the Great Recession, but they're stronger now", "text": "For a while, it seemed federal regulators closed a bank every Friday.\n\nSo many banks fell and for essentially the same reason: bad loans.

Then you know what happened after that,\" said Alex Sanchez, president and CEO of the Florida Bankers Association.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. swooped down on the troubled lenders and seized their assets, putting those assets into the hands of another bank in waiting. To unsuspecting customers, the change seemed to happen overnight, with the flick of a switch.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2012 more than 450 banks failed across the country, according to the FDIC.\n\nIn Florida, more than 70 banks folded during the recession and its aftermath. Small community banks suffered the most.\n\nThere are lingering effects: You don't see as many community banks as a decade ago.\n\nDocument:Financial Crisis Inquiry Report\n\nDocument:U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: A Profile of the Working Poor, 2015\n\nAs of June 30, 2017, Florida had 95 state-chartered banks. There were more than 200 in 2007, according to the Florida Office of Financial Regulation.\n\nThe number of community banks in Lee County can be counted on one hand.\n\nIn Collier County, First Florida Integrity could soon be the only community bank left standing.\n\nIn August the Lake Michigan Credit Union announced plans to acquire Naples-based Encore Bank and expects to close on the deal early this year. The credit union, with assets of more than $5 billion, opened its first Florida office in 2015.\n\nMore: Michigan credit union plans to acquire Naples bank\n\nThe recession spurred new financial regulations that led to more consolidation in the banking industry and discouraged the opening of new banks, which must raise a lot more capital.\n\n\"The FDIC has basically gotten very tough across the board and that makes it very difficult for banks to operate because of these regulatory burdens. What happens is that so many banks just started selling out,\" said Ken Thomas, a longtime economist and banking consultant based in Miami.\n\nMost of the new regulations came from the adoption of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which President Donald Trump has vowed to \"do a big number on\" because he believes it's too burdensome for all banks, especially smaller ones.\n\nFederal lawmakers saved some of the nation's largest banks with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the U.S. Treasury to supply banks with cash by purchasing up to $700 billion in distressed assets, especially mortgage-backed securities (the amount was later capped at $475 billion). The government doled out $439 billion and recipients have returned $390 billion a tally kept by ProPublica shows.\n\nMap/Database:Foreclosures in Fort Myers, Cape Coral\n\nMap/Database:Foreclosures in Naples, Immokalee, Marco Island\n\nAbout 85 percent of banks that failed in the U.S. from 2008 to 2011 were smaller ones with assets of less than $1 billion — and the majority were concentrated in 10 states led by Georgia and Florida, according to a report by Face the Facts USA.\n\nLee and Collier counties saw their fair share of failures. There were 10 from 2009 to 2013, stretching from Marco Island to Cape Coral.\n\nMore: Marco Community Bank shut down\n\nOne of the most high-profile collapses involved Naples-based Orion Bank, which ended in prison sentences for its ex-CEO and president Jerry J. Williams and two other bank employees for their role in a fraud conspiracy.\n\nThe scheme — orchestrated by Williams — involved illegally raising more capital for the bank and selling off bad loans to a borrower to make Orion appear in better financial shape than it was so regulators wouldn't shutter it. The bank saw a wave of defaults on big construction and development loans after the real estate boom went bust in Southwest Florida.\n\nMore: Orion CEO Jerry Williams indicted on bank fraud charges\n\nAfter spending nearly six years at an Alabama prison camp and six months at a halfway house to help him prepare for life on the outside, Williams was released Oct. 30. Court records show he's settled in Brentwood, Tennessee, where he's still under supervised probation.\n\nIn some cases the FDIC waged legal battles against directors and officers that it alleged had a hand in their bank's downfall because of \"unsafe and unsound\" lending practices. That included Williams and leaders with Immokalee-based Florida Community Bank, which regulators accused of being \"grossly negligent\" and \"reckless\" in operating the local bank after amassing an \"extreme concentration\" of acquisition and development loans that was \"quadruple that of the average bank in its peer group.\"\n\nEdison National, the oldest locally owned and operated community bank in Lee County, never faced the threat of failure. Why? Seasoned bankers and a mission of safety and soundness that started on Day One, said bank president Robbie Roepstorff.\n\n\"We just stuck to basic, solid principles of banking and we managed the bank,\" she said. \"We've always been on the more solid, conservative side of banking.\"\n\nMore:Economy bounces back, but many still recovering from devastating downturn\n\nFrom the recession Roepstorff said she hoped to see the regulation of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, credits unions and mortgage brokers, brought under one agency.\n\n\"It would have kept the whole financial industry much stronger,\" she said.\n\nGarrett Richter, First Florida Integrity's president, remembers how tough it was to open a bank during the recession. He and Gary Tice, who serves as the bank's chairman and CEO, started the institution — originally under the name First National Bank of the Gulf Coast — in 2010. They sped the process by acquiring another bank, Panther Community, because regulators were holding up their application for a new charter.\n\nRichter and Tice, who had started and sold First National Bank of Florida, weren't new to banking. They brought fresh capital and experienced lenders to the market who'd worked for them before — and unlike their competitors they had no bad loans, giving them an advantage.\n\nThe Naples bank has mostly grown organically through its own resources but has acquired several financial institutions since it opened. Those acquisitions included the failed Royal Palm Bank of Naples, with $87 million in assets.\n\nTighter lending requirements adopted in the aftermath of the recession impacted First Florida Integrity in many ways. It doesn't offer residential mortgage loans because the business is \"just over-regulated,\" Richter said.\n\nIn Southwest Florida and across Florida and the country, banks are much healthier now. Bankers are more cautious about the loans they approve, requiring more money down and basing their decisions on real equity, not \"phantom equity\" in overvalued property as they did leading up to the recession when home prices skyrocketed, Richter said.\n\n\"One of the components that caused the Great Recession is there was an abundant availability of money,\" he said. \"Banks were making lots of loans. They were motivated to make loans by government institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and these loans were being packaged and sold to investors.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nLongtime Sarasota banker Jody Hudgins, now a chief credit officer for First Florida Integrity, said there are many lessons to be learned from the recession. For bankers, he said, there's no substitute for experience in evaluating borrowers and their ability to repay loans.\n\n\"Too many times we have financed projects to borrowers with big financial statements and big tax returns that are 18-plus months old that are nothing more than a desperation move by the borrower because he will soon be out of cash and is desperate to make a successful project,\" he said.\n\nThe key is understanding how a bank's lenders get paid.\n\n\"Hopefully, we have gotten away from production-only goals for our lenders without any requisite credit performance metrics and clawback opportunities,\" Hudgins said.\n\nInteractive graphic:Unemployment rates for Lee, Collier (2003-2017)\n\nInteractive timeline:View a timeline of the Great Recession\n\nDoug Meschko, director of market research and a land broker for Land Solutions in Fort Myers, said times have definitely changed when it comes to lending.\n\nHe got a loan for a new home last year, putting down 50 percent, and his lenders still put him through a rigorous review.\n\n\"They don't let somebody buy three condos with 2 percent down each like they did back then,\" he said. \"They are lending, but it's a much more thorough process.\"\n\nBuying land is even tougher.\n\n\"There are more hurdles for land,\" Meschko said. \"There are very few people lending on land right now. It's pretty much a cash game again.\"\n\nThe good news? If another recession hits there's more equity in the ground.\n\n\"There is a lot more staying power because people have a lot more in their homes and in their land,\" Meschko said.\n\nMany bankers changed careers as a result of the recession. Some have become stock brokers or sell financial insurance. Others made bigger job shifts or retired all together.\n\nMore:It didn't have to happen: The Great Recession was avoidable\n\nEmployment in the financial sector fell about 29 percent from 2007 to 2011 in Collier County, but it has grown 27 percent since 2011, said Christopher Westley, director of Florida Gulf Coast University's Regional Economic Research Institute. Lee County saw a drop of 28 percent from 2005 to 2011 — and since 2011 employment has increased 27 percent.\n\n\"Both counties are getting close to but have not yet reached the previous peak before the previous recession,\" Westley said.\n\nIn Collier, average wages in the financial sector are much higher than a decade ago. In 2016 they were at $84,025, up from $69,667 in 2005, Westley said.\n\n\"It reflects how much capital has floated into the county since 2005. Those funds have to be managed and their purchasing power has to be maintained, which is what financial planners do,\" he said.\n\nIn Lee County wages for \"financial activities\" averaged $59,985 in 2016, compared to $46,267 in 2005, Westley said.\n\n\"The wage increases seem less significant once adjusted for inflation,\" he said.\n\nProponents argue deregulation could create more jobs here and around the country by making it easier for community banks to form.\n\n\"Community banks play a vital role in our economy,\" said Sanchez, with the Florida Bankers Association. \"We need community banks. Community banks give 50 percent of the small business loans in the United States and small business is what our economies are based on here in our country.\"\n\nInstead of a one-size-fits-all-approach, he said financial regulations need to be more tailored to the model and the risk profile of the banks, so they're not so overly burdensome on smaller banks.\n\nIn the 15 years before the adoption of Dodd-Frank, the country saw an average of 130 banks started a year. Since 2011 the FDIC has approved 15 applications for new banks in the U.S. Several of those banks have not yet opened.\n\nThe first full-service national bank charter since the financial crisis went to Winter Park National Bank in Florida in October after its organizers raised $39 million in starting funds in a stock offering. Led by longtime banker David R. Dotherow, the boutique operation is focusing on corporate banking, serving \"attorneys, doctors, CPAs, contractors and local small business entrepreneurs,\" according to its website.\n\nThe financial crisis didn't just hit banks.\n\nTampa-based Suncoast, Florida's largest credit union, lost $76.6 million in 2008, $77 million in 2009 and nearly $30 million in 2010. Despite such big losses, the lender made a strategic decision not to cut employees or close offices during the recession, but employees took pay cuts, with senior ones getting the biggest ones, said Kevin Johnson, president and CEO.\n\nThe credit union continued lending through the recession and worked with its customers to modify their loans as they became troubled, which ultimately reduced its losses and built loyalty with its members that helped it survive, Johnson said.\n\nToday, Suncoast continues to expand.\n\nSuncoast is nearing the $10 billion asset mark and with that milestone will come more regulatory hoops, requiring the institution to add more employees in compliance. While President Trump is pushing for deregulation, Johnson said he recognizes it will be an uphill battle in Congress.\n\nThe experience from the last recession, he said, has Suncoast much better prepared for the next one.\n\nThe lesson to learn from the last financial crisis is to \"guard against the temptation to become complacent about the risks facing the financial system,\" said Martin Gruenberg, the FDIC's chairman, in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., a few months ago.\n\nHe noted the country paid a high price for not recognizing the magnitude of the risks it faced: Nearly 9 million people lost their jobs, more than 12 million homeowners faced foreclosure and millions of other households remained underwater on their mortgages for many years (Lee County held the dubious distinction as one of the nation's foreclosure capitals).\n\nReforms have gone a long way to strengthen the country's financial institutions, Gruenberg said, adding that large banking organizations \"now operate with roughly twice the capital and more than twice the liquidity relative to their size than they did entering the crisis.\"\n\nFDIC-insured institutions reported a record $171.3 billion in net income for 2016, up 44 percent from 2011.\n\n\"It is now more likely that in the next downturn, large U.S. banking organizations will play a stabilizing role, rather than contributing to a deeper economic contraction,\" Gruenberg said.\n\nCommunity banks, he said, hold 13 percent of banking assets in the U.S., but account for 43 percent of small loans to businesses and farms.\n\nHe warned there are always challenges that could quickly change the outlook in the financial system from shifts in monetary policy to market corrections.\n\n\"While we all hope that the current high level of economic activity will continue, it would be a mistake, it seems to me, to take for granted that the next 10 years will be equally benign,\" Gruenberg said. \"We should, therefore, be particularly cautious and prudent in making changes to our system of bank capital.\"\n\nMap:Click here to see map of bank failures in Florida\n\nBank failures in Florida\n\nHere's a list of banks that have failed in the state since 2008:\n\nFirst National Bank of Crestview, Crestview, Jan. 16, 2015\n\nValley Bank, Fort Lauderdale, June 20, 2014\n\nBank of Jackson County, Graceville, Oct. 30, 2013\n\nFirst Community Bank of Southwest Florida (also operating as Community Bank of Cape Coral), Fort Myers, Aug. 2, 2013\n\nChipola Community Bank, Marianna, April 19, 2013\n\nHeritage Bank of North Florida, Orange Park, April 19, 2013\n\nHeritage Bank of Florida, Lutz, Nov. 2, 2012\n\nFirst East Side Savings Bank, Tamarac, Oct. 19, 2012\n\nGulfSouth Private Bank, Destin, Oct. 19, 2012\n\nThe Royal Palm Bank of Florida, Naples, July 20, 2012\n\nPutnam State Bank, Palatka, June 15, 2012\n\nSecurity Bank, National Association, North Lauderdale, May 4, 2012\n\nFirst Guaranty Bank and Trust Company of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Jan. 27, 2012\n\nCentral Florida State Bank, Belleview, Jan. 20, 2012\n\nPremier Community Bank of the Emerald Coast, Crestview, Dec. 16, 2011\n\nOld Harbor Bank, Clearwater, Oct. 21, 2011\n\nThe First National Bank of Florida, Milton, Sept. 9, 2011\n\nLydian Private Bank, Palm Beach, Aug. 19, 2011\n\nLandMark Bank of Florida, Sarasota, July 22, 2011\n\nSouthshore Community Bank, Apollo Beach, July 22, 2011\n\nFirst Peoples Bank, Port St. Lucie, July 15, 2011\n\nFirst Commercial Bank of Tampa Bay, Tampa, June 17, 2011\n\nCoastal Bank, Cocoa Beach, May 6, 2011\n\nCortez Community Bank, Brooksville, April 29, 2011\n\nFirst National Bank of Central Florida, Winter Park, April 29, 2011\n\nSunshine State Community Bank, Port Orange, Feb. 11, 2011\n\nFirst Commercial Bank of Florida, Orlando, Jan. 7, 2011\n\nThe Bank of Miami, N.A., Coral Gables, Dec. 17, 2010\n\nGulf State Community Bank, Carrabelle, Nov. 19, 2010\n\nProgress Bank of Florida,Tampa, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nFirst Bank of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nWakulla Bank, Crawfordville, Oct. 1, 2010\n\nHaven Trust Bank Florida, Ponte Vedra Beach, Sept. 24, 2010\n\nHorizon Bank, Bradenton, Sept. 10, 2010\n\nIndependent National Bank, Ocala, Aug. 20, 2010\n\nCommunity National Bank at Bartow, Bartow, Aug. 20, 2010\n\nCoastal Community Bank, Panama City Beach, July 30, 2010\n\nBayside Savings BankPort, Saint Joe, July 30, 2010\n\nSterling Bank, Lantana, July 23, 2010\n\nOlde Cypress Community Bank, Clewiston, July 16, 2010\n\nTurnberry Bank, Aventura, July 16, 2010\n\nMetro Bank of Dade County, Miami, July 16, 2010\n\nPeninsula Bank, Englewood, June 25, 2010\n\nBank of Florida -

A report about an ongoing investigation by the US Justice Department into the exchange was a factor in investors’ nervousness, he said.\n\n“Concurrently, a large market maker, Jump, was found to have withdrawn huge sums from Binance with no deposits over the past few weeks — ultimately seems to have caused jitters among both retail and institutional users,” Thurman said. “In short, it’s a lot of money headed out, and that’s spooked some folks.”\n\nJump Crypto is part of the Jump Trading Group, a quantitative trading firm.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that the exchange had at one point seen “some withdrawals” of roughly $1.1 billion. The company had seen worse days before, he later added.\n\n“We’re seeing the money flowing back already,” he said in a conversation on Twitter Spaces on Wednesday, calling the fund withdrawals “very normal market behavior.”\n\nZhao, who is known as “CZ,” said people were down on the crypto sector following the collapse of FTX in November. The founder of Binance’s one-time competitor, Sam Bankman-Fried, was arrested in the Bahamas this week after US prosecutors filed criminal charges against him.\n\n“If you get hurt by one bank, you’re going to think all the other banks are bad,” Zhao said. “The fact is just because one bank is bad doesn’t mean all the other banks are bad.”\n\nConcerns about the health of the sector have been driving down the price of digital coins. Bitcoin was last trading below $18,000, a decline of more than 60% year-to-date.\n\nBut Binance’s business is also under scrutiny after FTX’s spectacular implosion. On Monday, Reuters reported, citing unidentified sources, that US prosecutors were considering wrapping up a money laundering investigation into Binance by “filing criminal charges against individual executives including founder Changpeng Zhao.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nBinance said in a statement to CNN that, “as has been reported widely, regulators are doing a sweeping review of every crypto company.”\n\n“This nascent industry has grown quickly and Binance has shown its commitment to security and compliance through large investments in our team as well as the tools and technology we use to detect and deter illicit activity,” a spokesperson added.\n\nBinance had initially offered to help bail out smaller rival FTX, before pulling out of the deal last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bankman-Fried was indicted in the United States on eight criminal charges including wire fraud and conspiracy. Separately, US markets regulators also charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors and customers.\n\nKnown as “SBF,” Bankman-Fried is a crypto celebrity who became a pariah overnight as his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy last month, leaving at least a million depositors unable to access their funds.\n\n— CNN’s Julia Horowitz, Matt Egan and Allison Morrow contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}]}

The case wove it’s way through the legal system for years.\n\nTwo years ago, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a jury verdict that found that “Stairway to Heaven” had not been lifted from “Taurus.”\n\n“There are zillions and zillions of songs that are carrying the same chord progression, so it was very unfortunate, and it was unpleasant for everybody,” Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant said in 2021 during an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s “Loose Ends.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s ‘Blurred Lines’ featuring Pharrell Williams and T.I.\n\nPharrell Williams and Robin Thicke.

The board of directors for the WGA, which includes both a West and an East branch, voted unanimously to strike after talks between the guild and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the nine largest studios, failed to reach a contract. Writers, they said, are facing an \"existential crisis.\"\n\nIf it feels like a TV repeat, that's because it's all happened before. For 100 days in 2007 and 2008, writers went on strike, bringing the entertainment industry to a halt. Now those behind everything from network series like CBS' \"NCIS\" to Marvel movies to streaming series including Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" will hit the picket lines for the first time in 15 years.\n\nLatest strike updates:Hollywood writers, slamming 'gig economy,' go on strike\n\nHollywood haschanged significantly since 2008, led by the rise of streaming services. This has upended the traditional pay structure in the industry and, as the WGA argues, has led more writers longer for less pay (streaming series often have longer production schedules but fewer episodes per season, which is how their pay is calculated). At the same time, entertainment conglomerates are seeing financial losses, cutting jobs and have been shelving TV shows and movies.\n\nWe answer every question about the strike.\n\nWhy did the WGA go on strike?\n\nWriters are primarily looking for more compensation, with many pointing to the rise of streaming as having a negative effect on their earnings. In TV, writers are often paid per episode, and where a broadcast series once produced 22 or more installments each season, streaming series are more typically eight to 13 episodes.\n\nResiduals or royalties, which earn writers, actors and producers (among others) money after a TV show's debut when it airs or streams elsewhere, are lower for streaming shows than for broadcast shows that air reruns on cable or syndication.These lower minimums were established when streaming was in its infancy, and because streamers often insist on exclusivity, limiting the distribution of their shows elsewhere. In their pattern of demands, the guild also asked studios to standardize compensation forscreenwriting – regardless of whether a film is released theatrically or on streaming – and increase studio contributions to the pension plan and health fund.\n\nWhat about my favorite TV shows?How the writers strike will shut down some TV, but not all\n\nIn a statement announcing the strike, the WGA said, \"The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing ... They have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\"\n\nMembers of the guild tweeted details of the negotiations, including the AMPTP's counteroffers and outright rejections of many proposals, including setting a minimum number of writers to staff a show.\n\nWhy did the studios reject WGA proposals?\n\nThe studios approached the negotiations with \"the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,\" AMPTP said in a statement shortly before the talks began, and it has been a shaky time in the industry. Entertainment conglomerates and streaming services are looking to bolstertheir bottom lines, ratcheting back a spending spree on new content that has hurt profits. Many have reported losses from streaming to Wall Street in recent months and made plans to lay off thousands of employees.\n\nThe AMPTP said it presented \"a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild (April 30) which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals. The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.\"\n\nWhat TV shows and movies will be affected by a writers strike?\n\nViewers will first notice the effects on daytime and late-night talk shows, from \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Topical talk shows depend on writers and tape shows the day they air. So a strike immediately forces a shutdown.NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is also done for the remainder of the season, as three May episodes will be canceled. (The May 6 show was already being written for host Pete Davidson).Daytime soap operas also will run out of new episodes within a few weeks.\n\nMore:Is your favorite network TV show renewed, canceled or ‘on the bubble’? Our 2023 status report\n\nMost broadcast shows, such as NBC's \"Law & Order\" and ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" will finish their seasons; their finale episodes have already been written and filmed. But a prolonged strike could affect how soon they return in the fall. (A handful, including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" already produced episodes for next season in preparation for a strike.) Streaming shows operate with far longer lead times, meaning the delays caused by any work stoppage won't be felt for months. But it's uncertain whether actors (also unionized in the Screen Actors Guild) would agree to film projects from already completed scripts during a strike.\n\nMovies have an even longer lag time, so titles set to release in 2024 and 2025 are most likely to be affected by a strike, forcing delays.\n\nThe longer thestrike goes on, the more studios, streamers and networks will draw programming from non-WGA sources: Reality shows and foreign TV. During the 2007-08 strike, there was a boom in reality shows that lasted long after the writers returned to work.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/03/education-fed-interest-rate-inflation-mccarthy-biden-debt-migrant-mexico-texas-manhunt/70174588007/", "title": "Education, Federal Reserve, interest rates, debt ceiling, Texas ...", "text": "A new report shows American students are lagging in U.S. history and civics education.

Saturday Night Live, which has three episodes left this season, likely would have shut down for the season. Reruns likely would have filled those slots.\n\nA strike would have had little influence on the conclusion of the broadcast season this month, since finale episodes have been written and filmed, and it wouldn't have had an immediate effect on the traditional September rollout of broadcast shows, since writing staffs often don't begin work on fall shows until June. As in the past, a strike would have meant more reality shows and reruns.\n\nContractual issues included the level of studio and network contributions to the writers’ health plan and the level of compensation for TV writers in an industry affected dramatically by changes in technology, distribution and viewing habits.\n\nWith the number of scripted TV shows hitting record levels recently, there are numerous writing jobs, but writers paid on a per-episode basis can find themselves making less as more programs, influenced by cable networks and streaming platforms such as Netflix, produce fewer series episodes in a season. Many programs now make anywhere from six to 13 episodes per season, while the traditional broadcast order had long been 22 per season.\n\nHovering over current contract talks were memories of the most recent WGA walkout in 2007-08, which is estimated to have cost the California economy $2 billion.\n\nAfter the tentative agreement was reached Tuesday, the union negotiating committee recommended the deal to members, who must ratify it, in a message posted on the WGA website.\n\n\"We made gains in (payment) minimums across the board — as well as contribution increases to our Health Plan that should ensure its solvency for years to come,\" the message said. \"We also made unprecedented gains on the issue of short seasons in television, winning a definition … of 2.4 weeks of work for each episodic fee. Any work beyond that span will now require additional payment for hundreds of writer-producers.\"\n\nThe message also listed increases in writer residuals in High-Budget SVOD (Subscription Video on Demand) and, for the first time, residuals \"for comedy-variety writers in Pay TV.\" Job protection for parental leave also was negotiated, the committee said.\n\nThe summary continued: \"Did we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this Guild’s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept. That result, and that resolve, is a testament to you, your courage, and your faith in us as your representatives.\"\n\nThe absence of original episodes of broadcast and cable programs that would have accompanied a strike might have accelerated the ongoing flight from traditional TV distribution formats, as more people are cutting the cable cord..\n\nNow, as long as the agreement is ratified, viewers, perhaps breathing a sigh of relief, can go back to their regular programming.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/02"}]}

And that's the ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nHeading into the Winter Olympics, there was much talk of two host cities – one inside a tightly-sealed bubble where the Games would be held, and one outside, where daily life would go on as normal.\n\nBut the past two weeks have also shown the world two very different Games: For China, Beijing 2022 was a resounding success that exceeded all expectations. To the rest of the world, it remained a deeply polarizing event, that projected not only China’s rising power but also its growing assertiveness, ready to defy and challenge its critics.\n\nIn its meticulously managed “closed loop,” the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing have paid-off. Infections brought into the country were swiftly identified and contained, allowing the Games to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nIn the medal tables, Team China claimed nine golds and a total of 15 medals, delivering its best ever result at a Winter Olympics – and ranking above the United States. The stellar performances of its new Olympic stars – from freeski sensation Eileen Gu to snowboard prodigy Su Yiming – captivated fans in the stands and across the country, drawing an outpouring of pride.\n\nHear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic run 01:29 - Source: CNN\n\nBy Wednesday, nearly 600 million people – or 40% of the Chinese population – had tuned in to watch the Games on television in China, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). And while US viewing figures have been markedly down compared to previous Olympics, the boost in Chinese audiences will likely make Beijing 2022 among the most watched Winter Games in history.\n\nEven the official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, a panda wearing an ice shell, turned out to be a domestic success. Having been mostly ignored for more than two years since it was first unveiled, the chubby bear soared in popularity during the Games, routinely trending on Chinese social media. At souvenir stores inside and outside the bubble, people queued for hours – sometimes in biting cold – to take home plush toy replicas.\n\nBeijing 2022's official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen has become a breakout star at these Games.

Xi personally backed Beijing’s bid to host these Games, and made a flurry of visits to the ice rinks and snow slopes to inspect preparation work. The success of the Games present Xi with a moment of national unity as he gears up for an unprecedented third term in power this fall.\n\nBut for the Chinese government, part of the domestic success also comes from the avoidance of major political scandal or embarrassment. While the doping saga surrounding a teenage Russian figure skater has cast a shadow over the Olympics, it was downplayed inside China. The same was true of criticism of the Games in general, most of which was censored and blocked.\n\nRussian figure skater's entourage under investigation 04:49 - Source: CNN\n\nEarly in the Games, many athletes from Western countries were stunned by the stringent Covid restrictions they met upon arrival in Beijing. Some were placed in isolation for weeks after testing positive, while others complained about the bland food served in quarantine. But their criticism – including an emotional plea for help from a Belgian athlete – went wholly unreported inside China.\n\nInstead, Chinese state media avidly shared social media videos, posts and comments from athletes that portrayed their life inside the Olympic village in a positive light, praising the food, the Covid measures and the friendly volunteers.\n\nAnd much to the relief of government officials in Beijing, not a single athlete or Olympic attendee attempted to use the event to publicly protest China’s human rights record – a hot-button issue in the lead-up to the Olympics (though some have expressed critical views).\n\nIn December, the United States and its allies declared a diplomatic boycott of Games over China’s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang – which Washington has labeled a genocide. But apart from the notable absence of Western leaders at the opening ceremony, the impact of the boycott was seldom felt on the ground.\n\n“You can’t write stories about people who aren’t in Beijing – that’s the problem with the diplomatic boycott. There’s no story once the Games start,” said Susan Brownell, an expert on Chinese sports and the Olympic Games at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\n“I’ve predicted at the beginning that the political issues would fade into the background and the sports would take the headlines, and that would be the memory that would be left, at least for the general audience. I think that has largely happened,” added Brownell.\n\nGoing on the offensive\n\nBut Beijing wasn’t just waiting for the political controversies to fade. It has gone on the offensive, using the Games to push its own political message and hit back at criticism – despite having repeatedly derided Western governments for “politicizing” the Olympics.\n\nAs the torch relay got underway right before the Games, state media reported a Chinese soldier who was involved in a deadly border clash with Indian troops was among the chosen few to carry the Olympic flame. The report sparked immediate outrage in India, prompting New Delhi to join the US-led diplomatic boycott.\n\nThe next day, in a symbolic end to the highly choreographed opening ceremony, Chinese organizers chose Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a little-known Uyghur cross-country skier, to deliver the flame to the Olympic cauldron. (Her name could also be written as Dilnigar Ilhamjan.) To many outside of China, it was seen as a deliberate attempt by Beijing to confront critics over its treatment of the Uyghurs.\n\nTorch bearers Dinigeer Yilamujiang and Jiawen Zhao of Team China hold the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony on February 4. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nThen there came the high-profile appearance of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star and three-time Olympian who has been at the center of global concern after she was silenced for accusing a former top Communist Party leader of sexual assault.\n\nAt these Games, Peng met IOC President Thomas Bach for dinner, gave a sit-down interview to French sport news site L’Equipe – during which she denied she ever accused anyone of sexual assault or disappeared from the public eye – and was seen in the stands watching Team China compete in events like curling, figure skating and freestyle skiing.\n\nHer flurry of activities made headlines around the world – and like her previous public appearances, they failed to quell broader concerns about her freedoms. Inside China, however, none of that was reported by state media or shared on social media, where Peng’s name remains censored.\n\nHear details of rare Peng Shuai interview with Western media 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd as the Olympics approached its end, the political messaging got more pugnacious.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Yan Jiarong, a spokesperson for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympics Games (BOCOG), was asked whether Taiwan’s delegation would appear at the closing ceremony Sunday.\n\nYan, a former Chinese representative to the United Nations, took the opportunity to assert China sovereignty claims over the self-ruling democracy. “What I want to say is that there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an indivisible part of China,” she said.\n\nShe also jumped in on CNN’s question about whether the Olympics uniforms were made by forced labor in Xinjiang, calling accusations of forced labor “a lie made up by forces with ulterior motives.”\n\nYan’s comments – which appeared to be an outright violation of Olympic rules about political neutrality – prompted a rare rebuke from Bach, the IOC president.\n\n“We were in touch with the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) immediately after this press conference,” Bach said, “and both organizations, BOCOG and the IOC, have restated the unequivocal commitment to remain politically neutral as it is required by the Olympic charter.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government may see these combative remarks as a propaganda victory, for many in the international audience, they only serve as a reminder of how politically fraught these Games are, despite the organizational success and sporting achievements.\n\n“The Games as a standalone event have been run very well, and China did well. The organization has been phenomenal,” said Mark Dreyer, the founder of China Sports Insider in Beijing.\n\n“But again, it depends on what perspective you’re looking at. Are you just looking through that narrow lens? Because if you’re looking at China as a whole, the narrative (from outside China) is much more about China using these Games for sportswashing…I don’t think it’s really going to change people’s perspective on China as a country.”", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn'S Beijing Bureau"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/sandy-hook-10-year-anniversary/index.html", "title": "Sandy Hook parents continue to push for changes in the decade ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Watch CNN’s Special Report “Sandy Hook: Forever Remembered” with Alisyn Camerota tonight at 10 p.m.\n\nCNN —\n\nThey were living ordinary and full lives in the small New England town of Newtown, Connecticut, unprepared for the devastation that would unfold and occupy the rest of their days.\n\nMark Barden was a professional musician. Nicole Hockley had recently arrived in Newtown after a corporate marketing career in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn the morning of December 14, 2012, after killing his mother, an isolated and violence-obsessed 20-year-old with unfettered access to firearms shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School. Over the course of 10 minutes, he shot and killed 20 first-graders and six adults before ending his own life.\n\nThe lives of Daniel Barden, 7, and Dylan Hockley, 6, were among those cut painfully short that day. But in the long decade since, their spirit and memory have lived on in their parents’ devoted advocacy for safer communities.\n\nA month after the shooting, Mark Barden, Nicole Hockley and other parents who lost children that day launched Sandy Hook Promise, an organization dedicated to protecting children from gun violence.\n\n“I didn’t know what the change would be, but we would be part of it,” Hockley recently told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota for the CNN Special Report “Sandy Hook: Forever Remembered” airing on the 10-year anniversary of the tragedy.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Promise group first set its sights on gun reform. Along with other families, they sought bans on AR-15 assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, both of which were legally purchased by the shooter’s mother and used in the Sandy Hook attack.\n\nParents of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre victims speak during a 2013 press conference in Newtown, Connecticut. John Moore/Getty Images\n\n“There were a lot of guns that our shooter could have chosen,” Hockley said in February 2016. “He chose the AR-15 because he was aware of how many shots it could get out … (and) that it would serve his objective of killing as many people as possible in the shortest time possible.”\n\nBarden, Hockley and other Sandy Hook families found a sympathetic partner in John McKinney, their state senator and the highest-ranking Republican in Connecticut politics at the time.\n\n“My immediate thoughts in terms of my role in the aftermath was, ‘I need to do, and I will do, anything humanly possible to help these families,’” McKinney said. “[I] met with all of the other Republicans in our caucus, and I was very honest with them. I said, ‘I’m going to go negotiate and work with the Democrats.’”\n\nAfter months of meetings with victims’ families, town halls in the Newtown community and consultations with experts, McKinney and his colleagues unveiled their proposed legislation on April 1, 2013.\n\nWhen then-Governor Dannel Malloy signed the bipartisan bill three days later, Connecticut had enacted some of the most sweeping gun legislation in the country. The new law expanded the state’s assault weapons ban and banned the sale of high-capacity ammunition; required a state-issued permit to purchase any rifle, shotgun or ammunition; and created the country’s first registry of individuals convicted of an offense with a deadly weapon.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (R) signs a gun-control bill on April 4, 2013. Christopher Capozziello/Getty Images\n\nSince 2013, Connecticut is the most populous state without a mass shooting of four or more fatalities, according to a CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nA defeat paves the way for success\n\nThe Sandy Hook Promise parents set their sights on Washington, DC, to see if their home state’s success could be replicated on the federal level.\n\n“We approached the Connecticut legislature with love and logic, and they listened,” Hockley said in a 2013 speech introducing President Barack Obama. “I believe that with that same approach of love and logic, Congress will be persuaded to act.”\n\nIn April 2013, National Rifle Association-endorsed senators Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Penn., proposed a joint recommendation that would have required criminal background checks on people purchasing firearms at gun shows and online. The policy, known as universal background checks, was supported by more than 80% of Americans, according to a Pew Research poll taken at that time, giving the newly minted leaders of the gun reform movement reason for hope.\n\n“I just thought, ‘OK,this is pretty simple. This is basic. This is what everybody wants. Let’s just get that done,’” Mark Barden said.\n\nMost Republican senators and five Democrats saw things differently, however, and the bill fell six votes short of the threshold needed to break a filibuster.\n\nThe bill’s failure struck the families as a disappointment and a betrayal: Barden and Hockley both say multiple senators claimed to stand with them, then voted against the bill. But the two advocates found lessons in defeat and vowed that day to double down on gun violence prevention.\n\n“We’ve always known this will be a long road, and we don’t have the luxury of turning back,” Barden said in the White House Rose Garden. “We will keep moving forward and build public support for common sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.”\n\nPresident Barack Obama places his hand on Mark Barden, left, during a 2013 news conference after the defeat of a bill to expand background checks. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nBarden and Hockley returned to Connecticut with a deeper passion for their work.\n\n“If that were to have passed, I think there would have been maybe a sentiment of like, ‘OK, we’re done. We’ve got that fixed,’” Barden said. Recalling the words of fellow gun control advocate Sarah Brady, “‘Sometimes you need a good defeat.’ It kind of mobilizes people, catalyzes people. They know what’s going on. It did for me.”\n\nAfter studying other mass shootings and gun violence, they developed expansive programming to avert tragedies before they begin. That work has produced Know the Signs, a range of programs that train students and educators to identify, report and respond to behaviors that suggest someone might harm themselves or others.\n\n“100% of school shooters give off warning signs before they carry that out,” Barden said. “What if that person giving off those warning signs were surrounded by people who understood how to look for those warning signs, and then had the training and the tools to actually do something?”\n\nThat straightforward premise has yielded profound success. Sandy Hook Promise says it has presented Know the Signs to more than 23,000 schools and 18 million people. The training programs have helped districts and students avert threats of violence in West Virginia, California, Massachusetts and other states — not to mention nearly 2,700 students in need of intervention that the organization has connected with crisis counselors.\n\nFrom Sandy Hook to Robb Elementary\n\nHockley credits some of the organization’s success to its early defeat on the Manchin-Toomey bill.\n\n“To fail so quickly was just horrifying to me,” Hockley said. “But when you have a failure, sometimes that makes you look at things in a different way.”\n\nSandy Hook Promise remains a persistent force in the arena of gun legislation. Barden leads the organization’s policy side and has been active in every major effort for federal gun reform for the last decade.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a leading voice for gun reform, has known Barden’s commitment since he walked off the Senate floor following the universal background check vote in 2013.\n\n“I felt mortified. I felt like a failure. I went out of the chamber and there was a group of the families there,” including Barden, Murphy said. “He said to me something along the lines of, ‘Chris, I’m not an advocate for four months. I’m an advocate for 40 years. This is my child. I’m never giving up.’”\n\nBarden and Murphy have teamed up on countless failed policies over their decade of work together: extended waiting periods, extreme risk protection orders that would remove guns from people in crisis, a requirement on gun manufacturers to incorporate technology allowing only the owner to fire and a repeated pursuit of universal background checks.\n\n“We were building a movement that needed time,” Murphy said. “I gave the same speech a million times over the last 10 years to advocates. I tell them every great social change movement in the country’s history failed a million times before it succeeded.”\n\nIn May, another young man armed with an assault-style rifle murdered children in another elementary school, this time in Uvalde, Texas. Once again, the families consoled the new members of a lifelong club as they grappled with their own frustration and grief.\n\nThe memorial for the massacre at Robb Elementary School on June 24, 2022 in Uvalde, Texas. Jordan Vonderhaar/Getty Images\n\nOnce again, Murphy took to the Senate floor, begging his colleagues to do anything.\n\nBut this time, the “social change movement” was stronger, the gun lobby was weaker and something shook loose. Working with a bipartisan coalition of senators that include Minority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, Murphy helped pass compromise legislation accepted as the first major federal victory for gun reform advocates in nearly three decades.\n\nSigned by President Joe Biden in June, the law gives authorities 10 days instead of three to conduct background checks on gun purchasers and requires federal agents to ask local law enforcement if purchasers under 21 have a juvenile criminal or mental health history. It also incentivizes states to pass red flag laws like the one Connecticut passed in 1999, the first state in the country to do so.\n\nIt’s far from comprehensive and lacks the strength Murphy would have preferred. But he describes the legislation as both the culmination of a hard-fought decade and the opening of a new era in gun policy.\n\n“While this was just the beginning, man, it was a pretty important beginning,” Murphy said.\n\nThe long-toiling advocates saw other victories in 2022: In February, insurers for the gun manufacturer Remington Arms agreed to pay $73 million to victims’ families to settle a lawsuit centered on the company’s aggressive marketing of the assault-style rifle used at Sandy Hook.\n\nMore important to the families than the payout is access to Remington’s internal communications, including its advertising strategies, and the right to release the documents.\n\n“I’m very much looking forward to understanding what was going on behind the scenes, underneath the veil,” said Barden who, along with the other families party to the suit, plans to release the documents in early 2023.\n\nMore recently, a Connecticut judge ordered right-wing broadcaster Alex Jones to pay $473 million in punitive damages to victims’ families and a first responder in a case evaluating damage done by Jones’ repeated lies about the Sandy Hook shooting, including claims that it was staged and the grieving parents were “crisis actors.”\n\nPlaintiff William Sherlach hugs attorney Josh Koskoff while plaintiff Nicole Hockley hugs attorney Chris Mattei following the jury verdict and reading of monetary damages in the Alex Jones defamation trial in Waterbury, Connecticut, on October 12, 2022. Brian A. Poinds/Pool/Hearst Connecticut Media/Reuters\n\nThat order increases Jones’ tab across multiple cases to nearly $1.5 billion, a number that the families hope discourages other conspiracy theorists from spreading harmful lies that lead to harassment.\n\n“My focus was getting the truth out there and stopping that bad behavior,” said Scarlett Lewis, a party to one of the cases, whose 6-year-old son Jesse was killed at Sandy Hook. “And I think with bullying behavior, you first try to ignore it, and then when it doesn’t stop, you have to find the courage to stand up to it.”\n\nBut for the coalition of parents who have spent 10 years standing up to misinformation, powerful lobbies and the seemingly endless march of American tragedy, victories are simply followed by more work.\n\nJones has publicly rebuked the idea of paying “any money” to the families he has mocked and vowed to appeal his ruling. Since the bipartisan gun bill became law, 332 people have died in mass shootings in the United States, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nBut Barden and Hockley show no signs of slowing down. In between their separate interviews for this report, they excused themselves for a conference call. They discussed the guest list for an upcoming gala. They eagerly tended to the details of their no-longer-new and not-by-choice careers, persistently maintaining the momentum they have drawn from the worst day of their lives.\n\n“I used to laugh that we’re going to put ourselves out of business, but there will always be a need for people to feel acknowledged and visible, and to know that there are others around them that are going to be keeping an eye out,” Barden said. “There will always be a need for that, and so there will always be a need for this beautiful little, little project of ours.”", "authors": ["Will Simon"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/us/five-things-may-8-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on May 8, 2022: Start your week smart: Ukraine ...", "text": "Air travel this summer has been challenging to say the least.

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant.

Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins.

(The location currently is occupied by Babalu, a Mexican restaurant.)\n\n113. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Memphis is founded on June 20, 1970. Prior to that decision by Pope Paul VI, the entire state of Tennessee had been encompassed by the Diocese of Nashville.\n\n114. 1971: Outraged by the use of nude models and an exhibition of nude photography at Memphis College of Art (then known as the Academy of Art), brick mason Newton C. Estes kidnaps the 14-year-old son of art instructor Richard Batey, in order to force the school to remove the offending pictures. College officials quickly comply, and the boy is released unharmed two hours later.\n\n115. March 1971: In a victory for the citizens who organized to fight plans to extend Interstate 40 through Overton Park, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns decisions by district and appellate courts and rules that the federal Secretary of Transportation had failed to demonstrate the lack of “feasible and prudent” alternatives to the park route, as required by a 1966 highway bill intended to protect public spaces. The decision preserves the park.\n\n116. June 7, 1971: After years in Ellis Auditorium, professional wrestling relocates to the Mid-South Coliseum, attracting 9,253 fans for opening-night matches showcasing such suplex superstars as Tojo Yamamoto, Bearcat Brown, the Fabulous Moolah, Len Rossi and Sputnik Monroe.

April 20, 1972: U.S. District Judge Robert McRae Jr. orders the Memphis Board of Education to implement a desegregation plan that will require the busing of an estimated 13,789 students during the following school year.

East Memphis' 34-story Clark Tower is completed in June 1972, adjacent to the 22-story White Station Tower (now the i-Bank Tower), which opened seven years earlier. The twin towers remain East Memphis anomalies.\n\n119. April 17, 1973: Fred Smith's Federal Express — now, FedEx — begins operations when 14 aircraft take off from Memphis to deliver 186 packages to 25 U.S cities, absolutely positively overnight.\n\n120. June 4, 1973: The Park Commission ends the popular practice of staging commercial rock concerts in the Overton Park Shell after complaints about \"criminal\" behavior in the audience. According to the Memphis Press-Scimitar, crowds \"at various times smoked marijuana, drank alcoholic beverages, took drugs and openly participated in love-making.\"\n\n121. 1974: Harold Ford Sr. becomes the first black person elected to Congress in Tennessee. Other Fords who have held elective office include his brothers, John, Joe, Edmund and James; his sister, Ophelia; his uncle, Emmitt; and his son, Harold Jr., to name a few.\n\n122. The city completes construction of the Mid-America Mall on Main Street in 1975.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca.

Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136.

After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death.

The 34-hour siege ends when police storm the office and kill Goulet on Feb. 5, 1982.\n\n140.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181. His fur was brown and shaggy, his belly was round and saggy: A slobby Everybear, the original version of Grizz, the Memphis Grizzlies mascot, is retired for the current blue-furred Superbear when the team moves from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004.\n\n182. A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat. Reports of the marine mammal's meanderings transfixed Memphians for several days, but the docile creature eluded capture and came to a sad end: It was found dead in December in McKellar Lake.\n\n187. Farewell to the Ape Girl, water-skiing squirrels and a life-sized Dolly Parton sculpted from butter: The last Mid-South Fair at the old Fairgrounds is held in 2008.\n\n188. A second printing of more than 40,000 copies quickly disappears as Memphians descend on The Commercial Appeal offices on Nov. 5, 2008, seeking souvenir editions of the newspaper that reported Barack Obama's presidential victory with a front-page headline that proclaimed \"Yes He Did\" — a play on the Obama campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can.\"\n\n189. Sept. 22, 2009: Memphis Mayor Pro Tem Myron Lowery greets the Dalai Lama with a fist bump and the comment: \"I've always wanted to say, 'Hello, Dalai!'\"\n\n190. Crews in January 2010, dismantle Elvis' favorite roller coaster, the 80-year-old Zippin Pippin, marking a definitive end to decades of amusement park rides at the Fairgrounds.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

Long distance information, give me Memphis, Missouri: Memphis, Tennessee, population 646,889 (according to the 2010 Census), may be the biggest Memphis in the United States, but it isn't the only one. Some others include Memphis, Florida, pop. 7,848; Memphis, Texas, 2,290; Memphis, Missouri, 1,822; Memphis, Nebraska, 114; Memphis, Mississippi, 70; and Memphis, Alabama, which, according to a 2017 estimate, has 28 residents.\n\n198.

You'll soon see why it's a hit with kids, its 45 exhibition halls holding fossils, animal dioramas, and ocean life.

David Pastrnak scored a hat trick to give him 60 goals this season and 300 for his career as Boston defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-3 despite sitting out six regulars.\n\nThe previous record of 62 was set by the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings and matched by the 2018-19 Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nCONNOR BEDARD WATCH:Which NHL team has best odds to draft generational talent?\n\nFollow every game: Latest NHL Scores and Schedules\n\nNHL'S BUSIEST DAY:Bruins, McDavid, Crosby stand out in NHL's first 16-game slate\n\n“It’s hard to win in this league and there’s a reason why this record is at 62 because not many teams can get there, so it’s a special honor,” said goaltender Jeremy Swayman, who made 34 saves. “These guys in this room are more than deserving.”\n\nPastrnak joined MVP favorite Connor McDavid as a 60-goal scorer, making this the first season with two players reaching that mark since Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr in 1995-96. The Czech winger had 48 games when the pandemic ended the 2019-20 season, so that gave him the belief he could put together a season like this.\n\n“It’s been a lot of fun, I’m not going to lie,” Pastrnak said after his fourth four-point game this season. “It’s been enjoyable, especially the group we have here. We obviously knew the stakes, and it’s definitely special to hit it in a game like this. Made history today in the biggest league in hockey.”\n\nThe record seemed just a matter of time. Boston set the record for fastest to 100 points on March 2 then the fastest to 50 wins 10 days later, the same day they clinched a playoff berth. They clinched the Presidents' Trophy as the top regular-season team on March 30. They have 131 points, one shy of the record-setting 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens with two games to go.\n\nHere's how the Bruins did it:\n\nOffseason moves\n\nThe biggest move was firing coach Bruce Cassidy and bringing in Jim Montgomery. Cassidy wasn't necessarily the problem, as evidenced by his leading the Vegas Golden Knights back to the playoffs. But Montgomery gave the Bruins a new voice and had been considered a coach on the rise since he joined the St. Louis Blues as an assistant after being fired by the Dallas Stars and entering rehab.\n\nThe biggest player personnel moves were captain Patrice Bergeron re-signing for one year and David Krejci returning from a one-year stay in the Czech Republic. The Bruins had an impressive 1-2 punch at center again after searching for a No. 2 center last season. Speaking of Czechs, Boston won the Pavel Zacha-Erik Haula trade with the New Jersey Devils and signed Zacha to a four-year extension. He scored two goals against his former team Saturday as the Bruins tied the wins record and had a goal and an assist on Sunday.\n\nDavid Pastrnak and Hampus Lindholm\n\nPastrnak boosted the offense in Marchand's absence and Lindholm helped the Bruins weather the absence of McAvoy. Pastrnak had 17 points in nine games in October and has kept it going. He's the Bruins' first 50-goal scorer since Cam Neely in 1993-94, their first 60-goal scorer since Phil Esposito in the 1970s and their second 100-point scorer since Joe Thornton in 2003-04. If Edmonton's Connor McDavid weren't having such a spectacular season, Pastrnak would be a front-runner for the Hart Trophy. Lindholm had been signed to an eight-year extension after he was acquired in a trade last season, and the Bruins rewarded Pastrnak on March 2 with an eight-year, $90 million extension.\n\nGoaltending tandem\n\nGoaltenders Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman split time evenly last season but had that routine disrupted by the short-lived return of Tuukka Rask. But this year, the net has been all theirs. The Athletic reported that a small tweak by goalie coach Bob Essensa helped Ullmark reach elite status as a Vezina Trophy front-runner. Ullmark got most of the starts early in the season, but they have mostly alternated games since Christmas. Ullmark has a league-best 39 wins and Swayman has 23. They have only six losses a apiece. Their enthusiastic greeting of each other after each win shows that they're great teammates.\n\nAggressive in-season moves\n\nThe Bruins weren't content with their strong season. They added to their physical play by acquiring defenseman Dmitry Orlov and forwards Garnet Hathaway and Tyler Bertuzzi. The first two were acquired from the Washington Capitals and the Bertuzzi move was made because of injuries to Taylor Hall and Nick Foligno. Orlov has chipped in offense, with 15 points in 21 games after getting 19 points in 43 games with the Capitals. Hall returned Saturday, and the Bruins will enter next week's playoffs as the league's deepest team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2023/03/12/bruins-clinch-playoff-spot-set-record-fastest-50-wins/11459444002/", "title": "Boston Bruins set NHL record for fastest to 50 wins, clinch playoff berth", "text": "Associated Press\n\nBOSTON – The Boston Bruins’ T-shirt factory is struggling to keep up with all the milestones the team is cruising past on its way to the Presidents’ Trophy.\n\n“Fifty wins, it’s amazing,” said forward A.J. Greer, who was wearing a shirt commemorating Patrice Bergeron’s 1,000th NHL point while discussing Boston’s 50th win of the season, a 3-2 victory over Detroit 3-2 on Saturday.\n\nThe Bruins are the fastest team to 50 wins in NHL history.\n\n“I love playing for this team,” Greer said after assisting on Garnet Hathaway’s game-winner with six minutes left. “I love wearing the Bruins logo and especially with the results, it’s been an amazing journey so far. But we’re not really focused on anything right now besides playing the right way for 60 minutes every night.”\n\nHathaway gathered in a rebound and poked it in to break a third-period tie as Boston rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat Detroit and improve to 50-9-5 on the season.

And it’s kind of a testament to how hard this team has continued to work throughout the year,” Hathaway said before the team headed to Detroit for a rematch with the Red Wings on Sunday. “But I think guys want 51, you know? Guys are excited to play this team tomorrow already.”\n\nAfter blowing a two-goal lead and losing 3-2 to Edmonton on Thursday night, ending a 10-game winning streak, the Bruins fell behind 2-0 on Saturday before the game was 5 minutes old. But Hampus Lindholm and Bergeron scored 88 seconds apart in the second period, when Boston had the first 12 shots on goal and an 18-2 edge in shots in all.\n\nHathaway broke the tie in the third scored to avert what would have been the Bruins’ first back-to-back losses at home this season.\n\n“We never want to lose two in a row. We showed that today,” Ullmark said. “We came out a little slow. They came out hot as well. Give them credit, they really came here to play in that first period and we were just weren’t ready for it.\n\n“But we took a breather in between the first and second, and we told each other we’ve got to ramp it up a little bit. And then we absolutely dominated them in the second.”\n\nMagnus Hellberg made 35 saves for Detroit, which snapped a six-game losing streak by beating Chicago on Thursday. Andrew Copp scored a short-handed goal in the second minute of the first period, and Alex Chiasson also scored to give the Red Wings a 2-0 lead just 4:32 in.\n\nLindholm scored with seven minutes gone in the second, and the Red Wings appeared to respond quickly. But Dylan Larkin’s goal was taken off the board because he had smacked the stick out of David Krejci’s hands seconds earlier.\n\nInstead, Bergeron tied it on the power play, deflecting a pass from Jake DeBrusk through Hellberg’s legs.

We’ll take the split and run.”\n\nThe league's top regular-season team last year, Florida didn't qualify for the playoffs until the final days of this season. Their reward: a first-round matchup with the team that set records for the most wins and points in NHL history.\n\nAfter losing 3-1 in the opener, the Panthers twice took a lead but found themselves tied 2-2 heading into the third period.

The victory flips the home-ice advantage to the Panthers, and assures the series of a Game 5 back in Boston on Wednesday.\n\n“You can’t get too far behind anybody. Certainly not a team like the Boston Bruins, the season they’ve had,” Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. “We’d be more than happy to play seven of them, grind it out. Play as long as we can for as hard as we can.”\n\nMontour's first goal broke a 2-2 tie, Carter Verhaeghe added an insurance goal, then Montour scored again for Florida and Eetu Luostarinen added an empty netter with 2:25 to play to make it 6-2.\n\nAlex Lyon stopped 34 shots, and Sam Bennett and Eric Staal also scored for the Panthers, who seemed overmatched by the NHL-best Bruins in a 3-1 series-opening loss.\n\nBrad Marchand scored a short-handed goal, and Tyler Bertuzzi also scored for the Bruins, who set NHL records with 65 wins and 135 points. Linus Ullmark made 24 saves.\n\nBennett, who had been out since March 20 with an undisclosed injury, took advantage of a turnover by Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo in the Boston zone. Tkachuk kept it in, and slid it ahead to Bennett, who reached out to corral it and then extended to poke it between Ullmark’s pads.\n\nBut the Panthers had an even worse turnover with a man advantage, when Anthony Duclair gave it right to Marchand for the short-handed goal that made it 1-1. Two minutes later, the Panthers were back in the lead when Staal beat Ullmark, but Boston made it 2-2 just as a power play was expiring on Dmitry Orlov’s shot that went in off Bertuzzi’s skate.\n\nO CAPTAIN!\n\nBruins captain Patrice Bergeron missed his second straight playoff game. After sitting out Game 1 with what was called an illness, the team conceded that he had an unspecified upper body injury.\n\nThe French Canadian Bergeron left after the first period of their final regular-season game — in Montreal.

If the Bruins have only the records to play for in the final days or weeks, he said, they will instead try to make sure everyone is rested and healthy for what they hope will be a two-month postseason slog.\n\n“Us preparing for the Stanley Cup playoffs is more important than anything in the regular season,” he said.\n\nDefenseman Matt Grzelcyk allowed that the regular-season record “would be quite an accomplishment,” but one that is “pretty low on the list.” It hasn’t escaped his notice that neither the ’96 Red Wings nor the ’19 Lightning won the Cup.\n\n“We’ve seen that it’s kind of bit teams in the past,” Grzelcyk said. “We’ll just go out there and compete and let the chips fall where they may.”\n\nSimilar fates befell the 2001 Seattle Mariners, who won 116 games but didn't even make the World Series; the ’16 Golden State Warriors, who broke the NBA record with 73 wins but lost in the finals; and the ’07 New England Patriots, who won all 18 games in the regular season and playoffs before losing in the Super Bowl.\n\n“It was an unbelievable season, ’18-19, but I think it was almost too easy for us to play great,” said former Lightning winger Ondrej Palat, whose team was swept by Columbus in the first playoff round.\n\n“It was very frustrating after a year like that,\" Palat said. \"But I’m not saying it’s like the Bruins. The Bruins are playing unbelievable hockey, and they have a big chance in the playoffs.”\n\nOf course, Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup in each of the next two seasons.\n\nNeely never played his way to the trophy, losing in the finals to the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 and again two years later; he did get his name on the Cup when he helped build the Bruins team that won it all in 2011. That was their last championship, a drought this year's team is looking to end.\n\n“It’s been a pleasure to watch this team, there’s no question,” the Hockey Hall of Famer said. “Records are great, they’re nice to have -- and especially team records. But it’s really about who wins the last game of the year.”\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2023/04/18/playoffs-begin-bruins-tyler-bertuzzi-sebastian-aho-joe-pavelski/11685510002/", "title": "NHL playoffs begin: Bruins' Tyler Bertuzzi has great assist, steals ...", "text": "The Boston Bruins, already on their way toward a record season, traded for the Detroit Red Wings' Tyler Bertuzzi on March 2.\n\nThat satisfied the Bruins' desire to add offense with Taylor Hall sidelined at the time by an injury.

But under the bright lights of the playoffs, the Bruins crumbled, blowing a 3-1 series lead to a Panthers team that finished 43 points behind them in the standings.\n\nThe Panthers pulled goalie Sergei Bobrovsky and tied the game 3-3 with one minute to go in regulation before Carter Verhaeghe provided the final dagger in overtime.\n\nNHL PLAYOFFS:Scores, matchups and schedules for first-round series\n\n“Game 7. Overtime win. Against pretty much the best team in regular-season history. It’s unreal,” Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. “For sure it’s up there, and it’s hard to understand right now. I don’t think we need to understand right now. We’ll understand later.”\n\nFollow every game: Latest NHL Scores and Schedules\n\nBruins coach Jim Montgomery made a bold decision by opting to start goalie Jeremy Swayman in Game 7 in place of likely Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark, who started the first six games of the series. Ullmark, 29, led the league in wins (40-6-1 record), save percentage (.938) and goals-against average (1.89) in the regular season, but his uneven play in the postseason played a major part in the Bruins' undoing. His misplay while handling the puck in Game 5 directly led to Matthew Tkachuk's overtime winner, and Ullmark yielded six goals in the Panthers' 7-5 Game 6 win.\n\nThe move to Swayman – who had an impressive season in his own right (24-6-4 record, .920 save percentage) – was a mixed bag. Brandon Montour sneaked a puck through Swayman's five-hole on the backhand to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead in the first period, and Florida jumped out to a 2-0 advantage early in the second period after a nifty pass set up Sam Reinhart for a rip.\n\nBoston cut the deficit to 2-1 with a power-play goal in the second period and then tied things up with another power-play goal early in the third. The Bruins took a 3-2 lead a few minutes later when star David Pastrnak buried a bad rebound by Bobrovsky. But in the final minute of regulation, the Panthers knotted it back up on another goal from Montour before Verhaeghe got the winner at 8:35 of the first overtime.\n\n“The fact that we were able to do what we did after what they did all year … they’re an unreal team and the best I’ve played in my NHL career. The fact that we were able to beat them was crazy,” Tkachuk said. “Let’s be honest: Nobody in the whole world thought we were going to win that series except for the guys in that room.”\n\nWith the victory, the Panthers – who had an uneven season under first-year coach Paul Maurice after winning the Presidents' Trophy last year – advance to play the Toronto Maple Leafs, who won their first playoff series since 2004 by defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.\n\nFor the Bruins, this shocking finish begins an offseason of big questions. Will captain Patrice Bergeron be back? Will center David Krejci return? There will be time to answer those. Too much, in fact.\n\nBoston finds itself in a similar boat with the 2019 Lightning. That team tied what was then the NHL record for wins (62) but then was shockingly swept by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round (that Columbus team was led in net by Bobrovsky, who didn't even start this series and wasn't particularly great but did enough to get the job done). The Bruins can only hope their story ends in the same way the Lightning's did: Tampa won the Stanley Cup in 2020 and 2021 following its historic disappointment.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2023/03/22/nhl-playoff-bracket-standings-schedule-matchups/11508213002/", "title": "NHL playoff bracket 2023 updates: Standings, schedule for ...", "text": "The NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs will begin in mid-April and the biggest question is whether the Boston Bruins can keep their spectacular play going through four rounds of the postseason.\n\nThe Bruins clinched the Presidents' Trophy on Thursday night and have a chance to break the NHL record of 62 wins in a season.

USA TODAY Sports' NHL experts make their predictions:\n\nBoston Bruins vs. Florida Panthers\n\nBruins in five. Thirty-year-old journeyman Alex Lyon has taken the net for the Panthers and performed quite well (.914 save percentage). But these are the Bruins we're talking about here ... and a third-string goalie doesn't seem to stand much of a chance. — Jimmy Hascup\n\nBruins in six. I think, the Bruins will largely cruise to the Stanley Cup. But there's undeniably a lot of pressure on them and weird things can happen in a first-round series. These Panthers are just one season removed from winning the Presidents' Trophy, and while their follow-up campaign has been disappointing, they still have plenty of talent and players who can at least make things annoying for the Bruins for a few games. — Jace Evans\n\nBruins in five. Alex Lyon stole a game for the Panthers in the regular season series. He will steal another game in this series, but eventually the Bruins' talent and superior depth will win out, even if Patrice Bergeron isn't 100%. — Mike Brehm\n\nBruins in five. This will probably be the easiest gentleman’s sweep in Bruins’ history. The Bruins are on another level right now and I don’t see their season being stopped by a Panthers team that just doesn’t have the goaltending to keep up. — Mary Clarke, For the Win\n\nCarolina Hurricanes vs. New York Islanders\n\nHurricanes in six. New York does not have the firepower, but has an edge with goalie Ilya Sorokin. Ultimately, Carolina's depth will win out. — Hascup\n\nIslanders in seven. Carolina has gone 9-9-1 since March 11, the date of Andrei Svechnikov's final game of the season. The Canes will almost certainly dominate possession but will they be able to turn that into goals without the dynamic young forward? I have my concerns, especially going against a goalie as good as Ilya Sorokin and a team in the Islanders that has shown the ability to really muck it up in recent postseasons. — Evans\n\nHurricanes in seven. Ilya Sorokin is the better goalie in the series and the Hurricanes are missing Andrei Svechnikov while the Islanders look like they'll have Mathew Barzal back. But Rod Brind'Amour's coaching is what will make the difference in the series for Carolina. — Brehm\n\nHurricanes in six. The Islanders backed into the playoffs, so I’m going to take the Hurricanes here, even though it’ll probably be closer than expected. Carolina’s defense and goaltending are just better than New York’s, but Ilya Sorokin can steal games, so I can see him being the difference for the Islanders for a game or two. — Clarke\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs. Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nMaple Leafs in seven. Total gut-feel call here. It's hard to pick against the Lightning and their stout playoff history of late, which is to say nothing of the Maple Leafs' disappointment. But Tampa Bay has shown more cracks this year. — Hascup\n\nMaple Leafs in six. Last year I picked the Lightning in seven on the basis that I'd been burned too many times by the Maple Leafs. I am ready to be burned again. It just seems literally impossible for the Leafs to lose seven consecutive first-round series. They're too good and these Lightning have been too inconsistent of late. — Evans\n\nMaple Leafs in six. Normally, I would pick the Lightning's successful history (11-1 in their last 12 playoff series) over the Leafs' lack of success. But Toronto beefed up at the deadline and the Lightning have had three separate losing streaks of four games or more since the All-Star break. It might be hard for Tampa Bay to turn it around. — Brehm\n\nMaple Leafs in six. Yes, this is finally the year the Maple Leafs make it past the first round. Toronto is just too dominant of a team and Tampa Bay has been lagging hard in recent weeks. If I do end up jinxing this for Maple Leafs fans, just know I am truly sorry. — Clarke\n\nNew Jersey Devils vs. New York Rangers\n\nRangers in six. The Rangers ended the season unevenly after going all in with several moves, but this is now a more experienced group with stars all over the ice and a team that plays a more physical, playoff style. The Devils' time is coming, but they will need to endure the bumps of this ouster. — Hascup\n\nRangers in six. Perhaps I should believe in the Devils more. It shouldn't matter that this is just their second playoff appearance in the last 11 years; they just put together the greatest regular season in team history. They have home ice. Then I look at the goaltending battle: Igor Shesterkin, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner, vs. Vitek Vanecek, whose forays into the playoffs with the Capitals did not go great. Give me the more experienced Rangers, who loaded up at the trade deadline. — Evans\n\nRangers in six. Vitek Vanecek did outperform Igor Shesterkin during the season series and the Devils' speed will be hard to handle, but the Rangers learned lessons from their 2022 trip to the conference final and they've added former Stanley Cup winners in Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko. — Brehm\n\nRangers in seven. When in doubt, place your faith in Igor Shesterkin to show up big when it matters. This series is going to be a long fight between two bitter state rivals and I, for one, am going to enjoy every second of it. — Clarke\n\nVegas Golden Knights vs. Winnipeg Jets\n\nJets in seven. The Jets lost all three games to the Golden Knights this year by one goal, speaking to the potential parity in this series despite the regular season standings. Connor Hellebuyck is a difference maker as one of the league's best goalies, though he was ridden hard with a league-most 64 games played. The Golden Knights, meanwhile, will be going with Laurent Brossoit and Jonathan Quick. — Hascup\n\nGolden Knights in five. The Jets tried their best to miss the playoffs, going 17-19-2 following a 29-14-1 start. This feels like a team on the verge of blowing it up. The Knights could be fully operational if captain Mark Stone returns. — Evans\n\nGolden Knights in seven. Laurent Brossoit, a former Jets backup goalie, was strong down the stretch to clinch Vegas the top record in the West. Winnipeg has been a .500 team since the All-Star break. — Brehm\n\nGolden Knights in six. Connor Hellebuyck is going to be truly tested against this Golden Knights team. While Hellebuyck will be able to keep the Jets in this series, I believe the Golden Knights will eventually win out thanks to their better offensive depth. — Clarke\n\nColorado Avalanche vs. Seattle Kraken\n\nAvalanche in five. That the Kraken are here in their second season of existence is a win for the franchise. While the Kraken outscored the Avs this season, Colorado’s firepower will be too much to handle for a team that got here despite its goaltending (.890 save percentage). — Hascup\n\nAvalanche in five. I feel like the defending champs are somehow being overlooked entering these playoffs. Gabriel Landeskog's absence will hurt, but beyond him the Avs return most of the skating core that ripped through the playoffs last year, assuming Cale Makar returns from injury. Seattle has been a great story, but that goaltending scares me here. — Evans\n\nAvalanche in five. Colorado is using a different No. 1 goalie for the third consecutive postseason. Goalie Alexandar Georgiev has the edge over former Avs goalie Philipp Grubauer, the Seattle netminder who will be facing 100-point scorers Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen and a core that got it done last season. — Brehm\n\nAvalanche in five: The Kraken are a feel-good story — and have been playing well to boot — but that will end in the first round against the reigning Stanley Cup champions. Still, that’s nothing to be ashamed of if you’re Seattle, as the Kraken have a lot to build on after a successful second year in the NHL. — Clarke\n\nDallas Stars vs. Minnesota Wild\n\nStars in six. This could be a low-scoring series, but Dallas’ overall scoring depth and goalie Jake Oettinger (.956 career save percentage in the playoffs) will be the difference. — Hascup\n\nStars in four. The Stars are a well-rounded team that has an emerging superstar (Jason Robertson), veterans with loads of playoff experience who still produce (Joe Pavelski and Jamie Benn), a great young play-driving defenseman (Miro Heiskanen) and a solid goalie (Jake Oettinger). The Wild have Kirill Kaprizov and a lot of question marks. They find ways to win mostly with defense but there just doesn't seem to be enough offense here. — Evans\n\nStars in five. The Wild were among the bottom teams in five-on-five scoring and the Stars have a better power play and penalty kill. Jake Oettinger was spectacular in last season's playoffs and Dallas has better scoring depth this season. — Brehm\n\nStars in six. Jason Robertson is going to be a standout performer in these playoffs. The 23-year-old put up more than 100 points in his third full season and has rejuvenated the Stars offense. The Wild were a good team this season, but never really impressed at much of anything over the course of the year. — Clarke\n\nEdmonton Oilers vs. Los Angeles Kings\n\nOilers in six. The Kings limit the opposition's chances, but don't exactly have a stalwart in net, while the Oilers have the firepower with goalie questions of their own. I'll pick the team with Connor McDavid and the one that won nine games in a row to end the season, with two of those coming against these Kings. — Hascup\n\nOilers in six. The Kings are a good team, even better than the group that pushed the Oilers to seven games in last year's first round. Unfortunately for them, the Oilers are also a better team this year, have the best player in the world in McDavid and enter red-hot, having won 14 of their last 15 games. — Evans\n\nOilers in seven. Connor McDavid is hard enough to slow down, but if you do, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins have topped 100 points. Evander Kane led all playoff scorers last season while playing in only three rounds, and the Oilers' power play this season is clicking nearly a third of the time. The Kings will have their hands full. — Brehm\n\nOilers in six. Playoff Connor McDavid, need I say more? But seriously, I don’t think the Kings will be able to keep up with the high-flying Oilers. The only way I could see this going the Kings’ way is if Joonas Korpisalo completely stands on his head for a full seven-game series. — Clarke", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2023/04/17/nhl-playoff-overtime-rules-hockey-postseason/11651633002/", "title": "NHL overtime rules for playoffs: Postseason hockey bracket gets wild", "text": "The 2023 NHL playoffs began Monday and with it came the return of true overtime hockey.\n\nWhile preseason and regular season games end with a shootout if a five-minute, three-on-three overtime period doesn't determine a winner, the playoffs mean a lot of sleepless nights because games will go on ... technically forever.\n\nBut in this edition of the postseason, hockey fans and those rooting for the Carolina Hurricanes, New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers, Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs, Tampa Bay Lightning, Florida Panthers and New York Islanders in the Eastern Conference or the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Minnesota Wild, Vegas Golden Knights, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, Seattle Kraken and Winnipeg Jets in the West won't care too much about extended ice time for their teams.\n\nEXPLAINER:Why are NHL major penalties reviewed and what has been the impact in playoffs?\n\nLet's take a closer look:\n\nFollow every game: Latest NHL Scores and Schedules\n\nNHL playoff overtime rules\n\nThink regular hockey until there is a winner played like the regulation periods.

Reading scores declined in both grades, too, since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, average reading scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by three points from 2019, and average math scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by five and eight points respectively, the test results show. The test, which involved 446,700 students at 10,970 schools, across all states at the beginning of the calendar year, is scored on a scale of 0 to 500.\n\nThe 2022 results also show students the lowest-performing students performed even worse. And of particular concern, more students scored at what are considered \"below basic\" levels.\n\nNAEP scores by state\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed the scores state by state. There are glimmers of hope: Some states held steady in reading, and a few improved slightly. Fourth grade reading scores increased by two points in Alabama and Louisiana, and eighth grade scores increased by two points in Department of Defense schools. The most dismal declines occurred in math, and no state or jurisdiction was left untouched. Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, New Mexico and others saw double-digit score declines in either fourth or eighth grade reading, or both.\n\nThe pandemic wasn't easy on kids, their families, teachers or school leaders. The in-person rhythm of nearly every school in the country was upended, with students shifting, sometimes clumsily, to learning on devices, if they had them, at home in March 2020 and beyond. As the rest of the school year went and the next one came, school closures persisted. Remote learning looked different nearly everywhere, Carr said.\n\nFor all the agitation over reopening schools, Carr said students' scores don't directly reflect how long schools were closed to in-person classes during the pandemic. When schools did reopen, many students and teachers missed classes anyway in part because of COVID outbreaks.\n\nIt all added up to nationwide setbacks in learning and potential academic declines across the U.S. that may persist for years to come.\n\n\"What we need to do as researchers, as educators, as analysts is now take a second deeper dive to understand exactly what role it did play, along with all the other factors that were influencing students' lives like mental health and like disruptions in behaviors,\" Carr said, \"to help students' chances of recovery.\"\n\n'Largest score decline':In reading for nation's 9-year-olds, first-ever drop in math\n\nAcross the board, in all states, concerns remain for the most disadvantaged students – including kids with disabilities and English-language learners. The percentage of those kids, among others, who performed at or above the NAEP level considered proficient was smaller compared with 2019, the report shows.\n\nU.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said there must be a nationwide effort to recover and move students forward. And he's calling on school leaders to leverage the funding and resources the Biden administration made available through the American Rescue Plan to address student learning loss.\n\n“Let me be very clear: These results are not acceptable,” Cardona said. “We need to continue to approach the task of catching all of our students up with the urgency that this issue warrants. We must redouble our efforts to accelerate student recovery.\"\n\nHow did fourth graders do?\n\nFourth grade reading scores declined in 30 states and jurisdictions, while fourth-grade math performance declined everywhere. The national average declined by five points in math and three points in reading since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nSome states fared better than others. For fourth grade math, Delaware (-14), the District of Columbia (-12) and Virginia (-11) had the highest scores declines followed by Maryland, New Mexico and New York (-10 for each.) On the flip side, Alabama and Illinois' scores remained stagnant, and Iowa, Wisconsin and fourth grade math scores at Department of Defense schools dropped by one point, the data shows.\n\nMore:As pandemic lingers, students in Virginia school struggle with frustration, distractions\n\nDrops in fourth grade reading scores weren't as dramatic as math overall, but took a major hit in some places. Virginia (-10), Delaware (-9) had the largest score declines followed by the District of Colombia, Idaho, Maine, Oklahoma and West Virginia (-8 each.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, Alabama and Louisiana improved in overall average sores by two points, Hawaii improved in overall average scores by one point, and Arizona, Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Department of Defense school scores remained stagnant.\n\nOn average, fourth grade reading scores were the lowest since 2005, the results show. One quarter of fourth graders, on average, performed below \"basic\" in reading, a national increase of 3 percentage points from 2019, the data shows. The NAEP \"basic\" scoring category is described as \"partial mastery of the knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at a given grade,\" but does not have or define an achievement level description for below \"basic.\"\n\nHow were eighth grade scores?\n\nEighth-grade reading scores declined in 33 states and jurisdictions, and eighth-grade math performance declined nearly everywhere. More than a third of eighth grade kids performed below basic on the math assessment, a national increase of 7 percentage points from 2019, the data shows. The national average test scores declined by eight points in math and three points in reading since the onset of the pandemic.\n\n\"The eighth grade mathematics results are particularly concerning as that this is the place where a pivotal moment is taking place for students in their academic careers,\" Carr said.\n\nOklahoma (-13) Delaware and West Virginia (-12), Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (-11 in each) saw the worst eighth grade math score declines. Scores for Department of Defense schools dropped by just one point in comparison, and Utah (-3), Alabama, Alaska and Idaho (-4 in each) saw the smallest test score declines.\n\nStudents typically can opt to take algebra or geometry courses in middle school to level up in math in high school, but now they're recovering from the lack of more basic skills. In turn, students are losing out on lessons that will prepare them eventually for careers in math, science and technology.\n\n\"We need to be concerned about getting the students back on track so that they can be prepared for global competition in these areas, and national competition in these areas,\" Carr said.\n\nAnd for eighth grade reading, Maine (-8), Delaware, Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon (-7 in each) and Connecticut, Missouri, North Carolina and West Virginia (-6 in each) saw the largest score declines. Department of Defense schools (+2), Hawaii and Nevada (+1 in each) improved reading scores slightly, and Alaska, California, District of Columbia and New York held steady with identical average scores to 2019.\n\nNAEP scores are here. What's next?\n\nFederal, local and school leaders agree the results show will take extraordinary measures and a bounty of resources to meet the needs of America's school kids. And while some argue it's coming too late, there's no better time than now to solve and invest in every place experiencing declines in learning, Cardona said on Friday.\n\n“In this moment, we must prioritize intentional collaboration and innovation. We can’t be satisfied with business as usual,\" Cardona said. \"We must do better, and we can.”\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, the Education Department said it plans to hold sessions on reading and math with educators and education leaders to \"reinforce the President's call to use ARP funds to combat learning loss\" starting Wednesday and issue what it calls a learning acceleration guide to districts and states \"re-enforcing the key strategies districts and states should use to address learning loss and academic recovery, with additional resources over the coming weeks.\"\n\nMore:COVID-19 pandemic aid more than $300 billion short for dealing with student learning loss, study shows\n\nEducation advocates who were long awaiting the results demanded the federal government make further investments in student learning and school leaders to invest resources that could help make up for the declines.\n\nThey said the nation’s leaders should look at continued federal and state targeted investments that are \"crucial for students.\" They mentioned supporting student well-being and using learning practices to help students catch up at this critical time. And they suggested looking at data that shows what works, including intensive tutoring, family engagement, equitable schools and healthy relationships with teachers.\n\n\"Now is the time to activate these resources and supports,\" said Denise Forte, interim CEO of Education Trust.\n\nAcademic recovery can't solely be focused on what was considered \"normal\" in academic achievement before the onset of the pandemic, Carr said, noting that inequities persisted for the most disadvantaged students before it, too, and \"laid bare an 'opportunity gap’ that has long existed.\"\n\n\"It also showed how every student was vulnerable to the pandemic’s disruptions,\" she said. \"We do not have a moment to waste.\"\n\nTeachers, we want to hear from you: How is this school year going?\n\nIf you encounter trouble filling out the form below, find it here.\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

But some challenges are more endemic, the product of decades of low pay and lack of appreciation for the service that administrators and teachers perform.

We must counter by teaching truth\n\nShaun Harper Bradford Rogne\n\nLast year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe lost his reelection campaign, at least in part because his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, repeatedly declared that McAuliffe’s reelection would lead to the widespread teaching of critical race theory in schools across the Commonwealth. Simply put, attacking critical race theory helped the now-governor of Virginia secure his win.\n\nCritical race theory is a set of concepts seeking to explain the structural underpinnings of inequality and racism in the United States. But the term has been attacked by its critics as unfairly pinning blame on White Americans for some of society’s most pernicious ills.\n\nClassroom discussions about race, and what I like to call “truth teaching,” haven’t been as much of a talking point as they were a year ago, and critical race theory isn’t being debated as much in this year’s midterm campaigns. It doesn’t have to be. For the most part, conservatives have already succeeded in banishing talk about racism from the classroom.\n\nAfter a campaign of intentional misinformation and fear mongering, critical race theory quickly became one of our nation’s most contested and misunderstood education issues. Conservative strategists successfully convinced millions of Americans, including concerned parents of school-aged children, that it was being taught in K-12 districts across the country. No evidence exists to confirm that this was actually the case.\n\nAs of last month, elected officials in 42 states have introduced legislation that broadly aims to ban the teaching of racial and social justice topics in public schools, according to data compiled by Education Week. Similar bills have passed in 17 of those states. Many more school boards have enacted local bans. In addition, books about race have been banned in numerous districts.\n\nThe campaign to eliminate critical race theory succeeded mostly because White parents and state lawmakers were led to believe that White school children were being made to feel badly about being White. Where’s the proof that teachers, nearly 80% of whom are White, were doing this? They weren’t, certainly not in any widespread fashion.\n\nWith no credible evidence of an actual problem and no opportunity to vote on the issue, citizens who recognize the value of teaching our children the truth about America’s racial past and present won’t have a voice in the upcoming election.\n\nThere’s at least one state where voters will decide this fall what gets taught in the classroom. West Virginians will consider a ballot question known as the Education Accountability Amendment, which if passed, would amend the state constitution to give the majority-Republican legislature more control over just about every aspect of public schooling.\n\nUntil bans on truth teaching are lifted, our democracy will become increasingly susceptible to the exacerbation of the racial tensions, inequities, injustices and violent acts of racism that have always kept America from reaching its full potential. Educators, meanwhile, will have unchecked authority to lie to school children about race. One recent example of this is educators’ failed attempt to change slavery to “involuntary relocation” in Texas schools.\n\nThose who truly care about the advancement of our democracy must insist that its full truth be taught. Unfortunately, we may have to wait a while before that discussion resumes in our public schools.\n\nShaun Harper is a professor at the Rossier School of Education and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.

Having taught for over 20 years, my greatest joy is participating in a democratic institution that is for everyone.\n\nI stand for all my students by committing myself to perpetual learning and growth. I continue to update instructional strategies, let go of old projects that no longer serve my current students and adapt my curriculum and language to ensure my approaches are culturally sensitive.\n\nI teach well-rounded history to the best of my ability as I continually strive to keep my background knowledge robust. I am here to hold space for all my students regardless of their identity, political positions or other affiliations. To do this, I must rigorously and regularly examine my biases, consider what and whom I am centering and why.\n\nThat’s why it was so disheartening to see laws like House Bill 2 (sometimes referred to as the “divisive concepts” law) pass in New Hampshire. The disrespect and lack of trust it communicates to the hundreds of honorable educators I know and work with cannot be overstated.\n\nThe measure, formally known as the Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education bill, was written with the mistaken idea that discrimination is somehow endorsed or practiced in public spaces and classrooms.\n\nThe new law bars educators from teaching that any particular group is inherently racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive. It purports to promote teaching about people without regards to their race, gender, disability or other differences. But the language is so vague that it discourages teachers from having classroom conversations about race, racism and discrimination.\n\nLegislation like HB2 and similar laws in other states are obstacles to growth, student well-being and compassionate practices. HB2 prohibits schools in New Hampshire from creating mandatory equity training for faculty because someone might “feel bad.”\n\nBecause I teach social studies, I’ve developed a healthy resilience around complex conversations and divergent opinions. My entire career has been centered around navigating one tricky topic or another. I’ve mediated dialogues around presidential elections, the events of September 11, different wars and conflicts, and facilitated a variety of debates.\n\nThrough it all, I’ve dedicated myself to building a foundation of trust, joy, understanding, respectful discourse, care and acceptance in my classroom. Some of us are finding that harder to achieve under the new legislation. For example, a colleague who teaches in a nearby school district was told that if she openly said slavery was a “bad practice,” she must make it clear to her students that she is expressing an “opinion.” It’s an experience other teachers in my state have spoken about as well.\n\nAt what point did we decide it’s divisive to take a stance on cruel and dehumanizing activities? Who are we harming by taking a hardline on the concept of slavery? Our silence is an endorsement. That is our ethical crisis. That is what fear-mongering yields.\n\nTeachers deserve better: Shame and blame have been imposed upon a profession that is filled with loving, kind, compassionate and principled people. Choosing a career in education is almost always driven by a heart-centered desire to make a positive difference. I have never encountered a teacher in four districts, two states and 22 years who displayed devious political intentions.\n\nThe conflation of equity and inclusion work with “critical race theory” has led to wildly inaccurate and unfounded accusations. This “threat” has taken seed in the imaginations of some legislators and families.\n\nFuture voters must understand that disagreement is normal and healthy. Changing your mind in light of new evidence is logical and admirable. Nothing could be more American, patriotic or democratic than striving for a more just society.\n\nFeeling discomfort and dissonance often accompanies growth and learning; this is something I strive to normalize for my students. Teachers teach critical thinking and analysis by asking students to wrestle with challenging ideas and evidence. At some point, we have confused feeling uneasy with a lack of safety. There is a crucial difference.\n\nPoorly constructed laws were drafted to stop good, productive work under the guise of being “anti-critical race theory” and have resulted in the oppression of free thought, critical thinking and children. I know we can do better.\n\nMy message to lawmakers? Trust teachers. Asking them to be thoughtful, sensitive and inclusive is always reasonable. You’ll find that’s what they generally already are.\n\nValerie Wolfson, a middle school social studies teacher, was named the 2020 New Hampshire Social Studies Teacher of the year.\n\nNeal McCluskey: American schools have a diversity problem\n\nNeal McCluskey Neal McCluskey\n\nPublic schooling struggles with diversity. From early battles over the Bible to current fights over race, gender identity, prayer and more, public schooling – in which all must fund a single system of government schools – inevitably pits people with diverse values, needs and backgrounds against each other.\n\nBut why are conflicts burning especially hot now?\n\nCovid-19 set the conditions, creating clashes over in-person instruction and masking that many saw as having literally life-and-death stakes.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd added fuel, prompting many public school officials to target systemic racism – discrimination built into American institutions – and conservatives to demand colorblindness and an emphasis on America’s basic goodness. Graphic novels, such as “Gender Queer,” with graphic depictions of sexual activity, and other books on hot-button topics sparked dueling accusations of “hate” and “indoctrination.”\n\nThis all happened amid rapid demographic and social change.\n\nIn 2000, the US population was 71% non-Hispanic white. By 2020, that was down to about 58%. Gay marriage support skyrocketed from 27% of Americans in 1996 to 77% in 2021, while the share of people belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque plummeted from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020.\n\nWhat can deescalate education politics?\n\nNot “parents’ rights,” a term that can encompass useful things like requirements that districts share curriculum information, but sometimes seems invoked so that just one group of parents will get what it wants.\n\nGiving parents more say does nothing to change a system that forces diverse people, including parents, to fund – and fight to control – government-run schools.\n\nFreedom is the answer: Attach money to students – as many other countries do – and let families choose among diverse options. This can be accomplished through universal education savings accounts, such as Arizona recently enacted, scholarship tax credits and other choice vehicles.\n\nRegardless of how it is done, the goal of choice is to enable diverse families to access education they think is right rather than forcing neighbor to defeat neighbor to control public schools.\n\nNeal McCluskey directs the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute and is the author of “The Fractured Schoolhouse: Reimagining Education for a Free, Equal, and Harmonious Society.”\n\nDenise Forte and Randi Weingarten: How we can recover ground lost to Covid-19 closures\n\nDenise Forte Courtesy Denise Forte\n\nRandi Weingarten AFT\n\nAmerican students’ steady progress in reading and math has become the latest casualty of the Covid-19 era.\n\nIn the first results since the pandemic began, the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showed steep declines in the math and reading scores of fourth- and eighth-grade students. It’s not hard to see why. The pandemic has disrupted three years of students’ lives.\n\nMore than 200,000 children in the United States are grieving the loss of at least one parent to Covid-19. The economic fallout of the pandemic exacerbated food and housing insecurity. People were, and still are, stressed and scared. And remote learning has always been an inadequate substitute for in-person instruction, although NAEP results show comparable drops in student performance in school systems that were quicker to reopen.\n\nSome critics see this as a chance to point fingers and to use kids as political pawns. We see it as an urgent call to institute short-term and long-term investments and proven strategies to support students’ emotional development and to accelerate learning, especially for Black and Latino students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were underserved and behind their peers prior to the pandemic.\n\nWhat we must not allow is for students and educators to be dragged into bad-faith battles over bathroom access and participation on sports teams as an unwelcome distraction from ensuring that every student receives a great education and the supports needed to thrive academically and socially.\n\nThe good news is that we know what works from research and experience, and there is historic federal funding to accelerate learning and to start to remedy long-standing inequities. Resources from the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan and the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund can be directed so students have better access to experienced, diverse and certified teachers, high-quality summer and after-school programs, engaging and relevant curriculums and mental health supports.\n\nBoth our organizations are engaged in longer-term strategies to address the needs of kids, families and communities, but there are interventions that can help students right now.\n\nIn the short term, targeted, intensive tutoring has large positive effects on both math and reading achievement. Teachers tend to be the most consistently effective tutors; however, recent studies have found that paraprofessionals (teaching assistants), AmeriCorps volunteers and others who are trained to support student learning can be just as effective when tutoring one-on-one or in small groups.\n\nMany states are using state and federal funds to invest in strategies to increase the diversity of the workforce. Access to a racially and culturally diverse teacher workforce is beneficial for all pre-K-12 students, particularly for students of color, who often thrive in classrooms led by teachers who share their racial and cultural background.\n\nThe pandemic’s impact on children cannot be measured by assessments alone. But we hope that the alarm over the steep drop in NAEP scores creates urgency to address the conditions that contributed to the decline, many of which far predate the pandemic.\n\nEducators didn’t need to see declines in test scores to know what to do right now: focus like a laser on helping our kids recover and thrive.\n\nSafety was required to return to in-person teaching and learning. Now is the time to double down on proven strategies, using the resources we are fortunate to have, to deliver on a promise the US has not yet fulfilled—providing every child access to a high quality public education, without exception.\n\nDenise Forte is the CEO at The Education Trust. Randi Weingarten is president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nJay Richards: The battle over parents’ rights in education is just getting started\n\nJay Richards The Heritage Foundation\n\nIt should come as no surprise that parents have been fighting for their rights so vociferously when it comes to public education. They’re fighting because they sense that those rights are under attack.\n\nIt started with the lockdowns in 2020. For the first time, many parents suddenly saw, courtesy of online conferencing apps like Zoom, what their kids were being taught. And they didn’t like it: Toxic and divisive ideas about race – disguised as lessons on slavery and racism – contradicted the belief in racial equality that most Americans – whatever their politics – shared with civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBut critical race theory is far less shocking than the radical gender ideology that seems to have overtaken our nation’s schools. It teaches children that “some people are boys, some people are girls, some people are both, neither, or somewhere in between”’ – as one popular children’s book puts it.\n\nSchools are promoting the notion that some kids – perhaps many kids if recent trends continue – are born in the wrong body. Suddenly, from Florida to Texas to Wyoming, parents are discovering that schools are teaching, seemingly across the curriculum, that an internal sense of gender trumps biological sex. Worse, some schools are changing, at their students’ request – but without their parents’ knowledge or consent – their students’ names and pronouns to conform to a child’s surprising new “gender identity.”\n\nWhen parents come to school board meetings to complain, far too many are met with silence or risible accusations that they are politicizing education. Parents have the primary right and responsibility to raise and teach their children.\n\nMany parents delegate part of the teaching task to schools, in an act of trust. Rather than acting as faithful stewards of that trust, too many schools have decided that it’s their job to alienate kids from “regressive” views of their parents.\n\nIs it any wonder that this has proved controversial?\n\nWe could dissipate some of the heat by increasing the rights of parents over their children’s schooling. States should connect school money to children, rather than to school buildings. Universal school choice for everyone – rich and poor, conservative and liberal – would not just make schools better and more competitive. It would make them less of an arena for the culture war that is otherwise roiling our culture.\n\nJay Richards is the William E. Simon Senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, where he is also director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family.\n\nAkilah Alleyne: The education investments we need to make\n\nAkilah Alleyne Akilah Alleyne\n\nBook bans and censorship debates have always existed, but America’s children are facing an unprecedented moment in history. Today, school resources are stretched thin, schools are facing teacher and staff shortages and districts are still grappling with the long-term effects of the pandemic on student learning, as individuals’ rights to quality education are under increasing threat.\n\nImportant investments toward providing more supports for teachers, classroom aid and salary increases – such as by passing the RAISE Act – are needed now more than ever. That measure would provide teachers tax credits totaling as much as $15,000 each year.\n\nRather than addressing the real challenges facing teachers, many MAGA extremists have taken aim at books, racial and gender inclusion and more. Defunding the Department of Education, an ongoing federal level tactic among other changes in public school funding, should not be a topic of debate. However, it has also been central to MAGA Republicans’ federal policy agenda and could have devastating consequences for students nationwide.\n\nWhile parents are working with teachers and librarians to ensure that every child is acknowledged in school curricula and has a chance to thrive in school, regardless of who they are or where they live, far-right MAGA extremists are increasingly running for vacant school board seats or for reelection to gain control and power over decision-making at all levels of government.\n\nStudents and teachers want safer schools that reflect the diversity of their families and teach truthful history. They can be best supported through policy making that increases equity and understanding in our school systems by supporting their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, not denying them.\n\nAkilah Alleyne is the director for K-12 Education at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington, DC.\n\nRoss Wiener: Restoring trust in public schools should be a national priority\n\nRoss Wiener Courtesy Ross Wiener\n\nPublic schools educate approximately 90% of young Americans. The society we are, and the one we will become, is profoundly shaped by public education.\n\nIt has made America more inclusive, improving outcomes across lines of race, gender and ability status. The result has been overwhelming bipartisan support for public schools over generations.\n\nBut the evidence of a crisis in our public schools is overwhelming: Hundreds of thousands of students have disappeared from school rolls, derailing their futures and foreshadowing budget woes when emergency Covid-19 relief funds expire. The Nation’s Report Card reported historic declines in reading and math scores, not surprising given pandemic disruptions.\n\nWhat’s more, educator morale is low, exacerbating staff shortages. Classrooms are targets in the culture wars, leading to book bans and speech codes that never end well. Young people report epidemic levels of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe pandemic and broader turmoil afflicting the nation have left public education in peril. Every one of us has a stake in reversing this decline because, whether we’re talking about growing the economy or strengthening democracy, every path to redeeming the promise of America runs through public schools. Addressing lost learning is important, and so is addressing the lack of trust in public education.\n\nPublic education has played an enormous societal role: In the 19th century, common schools forged shared identity when government of the people, by the people, for the people was a novel idea. In the 20th century, universal high school fueled the growth of the middle class.\n\nOver the last several decades, the broad vision that propelled America’s public schools has dwindled into a narrow, technocratic policy frame.\n\n“A Nation at Risk,” a major report on education released by the Reagan administration in 1983, used fear-based arguments to argue that reading and math test scores were essential for national security. This logic eventually transformed test scores from one critical indicator (which they are) to the very purpose of public schools (which they are not).\n\nEarly accountability reforms led to gains among low-income students and students of color, but progress plateaued a decade ago. Test-and-accountability reforms over-promised and under-delivered and no longer command broad bipartisan support.\n\nRenewing the promise of public education starts by rebuilding trust. Local education leaders were left holding the bag on school closings that should have been shared with health officials and political leaders.\n\nSchools were expected to arrange meals, computers and broadband access – burdens they often shouldered alone. This was thrust on school systems where teachers already felt beleaguered and disrespected; in truth, our schools have operated in a low-trust environment for years. This led to schools being closed for far too long with continuing consequences, not only in diminished learning but also in diminished public support.\n\nWe must recommit to the mission of public education.\n\nThe Aspen Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of state policymakers to ask: What do we want to be true about the opportunities our public schools offer? After reflecting on values and reviewing research, these policymakers authored “Opportunity to Learn, Responsibility to Lead.” The principles they developed refocus attention on the core purposes of education in a diverse democracy and market-driven economy. It presents an evidence-informed vision for schools as engines of opportunity, which could galvanize the political middle to coalesce around a more positive approach.\n\nState leaders should call for a public conversation about the future of their state and the role of public education in realizing that future. Unspent federal Covid-19 relief can be a perfect catalyst for this work. Grants to community-based organizations and PTAs, after-school providers, 4-H Clubs and faith-based youth groups can support stakeholders in articulating what they want to be true about their public schools and identifying opportunities in their communities. Universities, chambers of commerce and other civic organizations can use their own resources to sponsor similar inquiries.\n\nExperience demonstrates there is much common ground to be found in efforts to strengthen public schools. Channeling Americans’ shared commitment to opportunity is the ideal antidote to the cynicism and division currently plaguing the policy and politics of public education.\n\nRoss Wiener is executive director of the Education & Society Program at the Aspen Institute and the author of “We Are What We Teach.”\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard: We can fix America’s teacher shortage\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard Teach for America\n\nTeacher shortages are not new, especially in schools serving predominantly students from low-income backgrounds, who are disproportionately young people of color. Yet cracks in the system before the pandemic have become gaping crevasses: In February 2022, there were nearly 600,000 fewer educators in public schools than there were in January 2020, and National Center for Education data showed less than half of schools serving majority Black and brown students were fully staffed.\n\nThe organization I lead, Teach For America, has 33 years of experience attracting talented individuals early in their careers to teach in rural and urban classrooms. Our research into the priorities of current college students finds that they want to have an impact on what matters most in the world, and the issue of quality education for all children is in their top five.\n\nHowever, they also want to preserve their mental health and have financial stability, and the teaching profession’s low pay and structures that challenge work-life balance are deterrents – especially when the average student-loan debt is nearly $30,000 and many other professions offer flexible schedules and remote work options. This disconnect affects the profession at large, which has been struggling for years. Between 2008 and 2019, the number of graduates from traditional teacher education programs fell by more than a third.\n\nWe can tackle these issues in a number of ways: by increasing teacher pay; creating financial incentives for effective educators to teach in schools serving low-income communities; expanding student loan forgiveness for teachers, especially in hard-to-staff schools and subjects; ensuring teachers’ have sufficient resources and planning time, proper administrative help and the support of counselors and nurses; and fostering educator wellbeing by offering mental health supports and addressing sources of occupation-related stress.\n\nThese policies and practices will make teaching more desirable and accessible and will work to increase the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the teaching workforce, a move that research shows has a positive impact for students.\n\nAs essential as these efforts are, they are not sufficient to address teacher shortages in the long term. Our country must think boldly at this moment about another problem that needs solving: What if the real issue is not that young adults don’t want to teach, but that the purpose of education has changed drastically and our education system has not kept up? What if we’ve reached the limits of this outmoded system and the conventional role of the teacher?\n\nIt’s time to expand the traditional definition of learning to include all the skills and mindsets that students want and need to thrive in our 21st century world and careers of the future: qualities like developing empathy, sustaining mental health and wellbeing, building relationships and applying learning to solve real-world problems.\n\nRedefining learning opens the door to a more diverse set of adult leaders to work alongside educators and students: professionals in various fields who can support the development of students’ workplace skills; college students who can support digital literacy and serve as tutors and mentors; and any number of community leaders who can support students’ sense of belonging.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor example, technology could allow expert educators to teach multiple classes virtually while a colleague who is expert in creating productive learning spaces – where every student is valued and feels they belong – focuses there. Many teachers excel at both roles – we just don’t have enough of them to staff every classroom in our country. This shift is not only about making teachers’ jobs more sustainable, but also about positioning teachers to further develop their areas of greatest expertise.\n\nFundamental changes of this magnitude don’t happen quickly. But, for too long, we’ve expected teachers to carry the weight of an outmoded education system. We can’t just replenish this system. We must redefine what and how students learn and reimagine the role of the teacher to inspire a new generation of purpose-driven young people to get involved and reinvent the system for a stronger, more equitable future.\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard is the CEO of Teach For America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving educational access, opportunity and outcomes for young people in low-income communities.

America has a smaller-than-average share of top-performing math students, and scores have essentially been flat for two decades.\n\nOne likely reason: U.S. high schools teach math differently than other countries.\n\nClasses here often focus on formulas and procedures rather than teaching students to think creatively about solving complex problems involving all sorts of mathematics, experts said. That makes it harder for students to compete globally, be it on an international exam or in colleges and careers that value sophisticated thinking and data science.\n\nThere is a growing chorus of math experts who recommend ways to bring America’s math curriculum into the 21st century to make it more reflective of what children in higher-performing countries learn. Some schools experiment with ways to make math more exciting, practical and inclusive.\n\n“There’s a lot of research that shows when you teach math in a different way, kids do better, including on test scores,” said Jo Boaler, a mathematics professor at Stanford University who is behind a major push to remake America's math curriculum.\n\nStandardized tests:How many exams should kids have to take?\n\nHere are some ideas for improving it:\n\nStop teaching the ‘geometry sandwich’\n\nMost American high schools teach algebra I in ninth grade, geometry in 10th grade and algebra II in 11th grade – something Boaler calls “the geometry sandwich.”\n\nOther countries teach three straight years of integrated math – I, II and III — in which concepts of algebra, geometry, probability, statistics and data science are taught together, allowing students to take deep dives into complex problems.\n\nGeographic disparity:States with the best (and worst) schools\n\nIn higher-performing countries, statistics or data science – the computer-based analysis of data, often coupled with coding – is a larger part of the math curriculum, Boaler said. Most American classes focus on teaching rote procedures, she said.\n\nNext year, Boaler and a research team plan to recommend that California phase out the algebra-geometry pathway in favor of integrated math for all students – something she pitched to education leaders across the state.\n\nSome states, such as Utah, have made the switch. The Common Core academic standards, a version of which most states adopted, say high school math can be taught in either format.\n\nDoes Common Core work? Despite new standards and more testing, reading and math scores haven't budged in a decade\n\nThe move requires extra time and resources to train teachers. Georgia mandated high schools teach integrated math starting in 2008. After pushback from teachers and parents, it gave schools the option to go back to the old sequence in 2016. In one large survey, Georgia teachers said they didn’t want to specialize in more than one math area.\n\nThe podcast Freakonomics featured an episode in October about the peculiarities of America’s math curriculum. Hosted by University of Chicago economist Steve Levitt, it highlighted Boaler's work and garnered significant feedback, given the specificity of the topic, Levitt told USA TODAY.\n\nLevitt is engaged in the movement to upend traditional math instruction. He said high schools could consider whittling down the most useful elements of geometry and the second year of algebra into a one-year course. Then students would have more room in their schedules for more applicable math classes.\n\n“When you talk to people within the math education industry, they call that insanely radical,” Levitt said. “I think most parents would not consider it radical to teach only the best of two subjects that most people don’t like that much.”\n\nMake more room for data science\n\n“Ninety percent of the data we have in the world right now was created in the past two years,” Boaler said. “We’re at a point in this world where things are changing, and we need to help students navigate that new world.”\n\nOther countries act more quickly on that idea. Estonia students ranked first among European countries in mathematics, as well as reading and science, on the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment. Many factors may have helped: The country offers high-quality early childhood education to all kids, class sizes are small, and there's little high-stakes testing, leaving more time for instruction.\n\nUnlike other countries, Estonia teaches computer programming at all grade levels – a strategy started in the upper grades in the late '90s and extended to elementary schools around 2012. The country is experimenting with adopting a new computer-based math curriculum.\n\nComputer-based math:What it looks like, and why it's important\n\nIn the USA, about 3,300 students this year in 15 Southern California school districts are taking a new Introduction to Data Science course that features data and statistics, real-life data collection and coding to analyze the data. The course was developed by the University of California-Los Angeles and the LA Unified School District, and it counts as a statistics credit.\n\nThe class features a scripted curriculum with engaging exercises, such as having students record how much time they spend grooming themselves, then comparing that with national data collected for the American Time Use survey.\n\nTeachers are trained to teach the class, as many haven’t been exposed to programming before, said Suyen Machado, director of the Introduction to Data Science project.\n\nStudents who took the new course showed significant growth in their statistical understanding over the year, studies show. Students said they felt learning to code was a valuable skill.\n\n“A lot of students report that they find the content is more applicable to real life,” Machado said. “One of the more challenging things about the course is learning programming. They say it’s hard, but they want to do it.”\n\nStop splitting up students so much, and don’t hasten the curriculum\n\nOver the years, some schools have sought to raise math achievement by pushing algebra down to eighth grade. High-flying students may adapt and have room to take more advanced high school classes. Hastening the curriculum can widen the gulf in achievement between lower-performing students, including those who are economically disadvantaged and racial minorities.\n\nThe practice reflects a long-standing feature of American math education: As early as middle school, students are often split into \"tracks\" in ways that predetermine who will take advanced classes in high school. The advanced classes are often full of students who are white or Asian and attend suburban schools – while black and Latino students continue to be underrepresented, research shows.\n\nAbout six years ago, San Francisco’s school leaders sought to tackle the problem. They halted teaching algebra I in eighth grade. Students take the same three-year sequence of math courses in middle school, and everyone is enrolled in mixed-ability classrooms, said Lizzy Hull Barnes, math supervisor at the San Francisco Unified School District.\n\nIn high school, all students take ninth grade algebra and 10th grade geometry. After that, students can choose their path: Some may pick algebra II, others may choose a course combining algebra II and pre-calculus. Some may accelerate to AP statistics.\n\nBefore the change, 40% of graduating seniors in San Francisco had to repeat algebra I in their academic careers. For the Class of 2019, the first cohort of students to follow the new sequence, just 8% of students had to repeat the course.\n\nThe changes led to a major increase in disadvantaged students enrolling in higher-level math classes as juniors and seniors, Barnes said. Boosting the success of black and Latino students did not harm the progress of high-achieving white and Asian students.\n\n“It’s been a seismic shift,” Barnes said.\n\nIn New York, an uproar over axing gifted tracks:This school is doing it anyway\n\nChange the way elementary teachers think about math\n\nImproving the math aptitude of older students in the USA is connected to messages students hear about why math is important and who's good at it when they're younger.\n\nThose messages often come from their elementary school teachers, many of whom didn’t like math as students themselves.\n\n\"Math phobia is real. Math anxiety is real,\" said DeAnn Huinker, a professor of mathematics education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who teaches future elementary and middle school teachers.\n\nNew research suggests that when teachers improve their attitude toward math, it can help to raise student test scores. At Stanford, Boaler and her team designed an online course for teachers featuring research showing anyone can learn math with enough practice, intelligence isn’t fixed and math is connected to all sorts of everyday activities.\n\nThey recruited fifth grade teachers from a county in central California to take and discuss the course. Within a year, the participating teachers' students posted significantly higher state math scores compared with previous years. The jumps were particularly significant for girls and low-income students, Boaler said.\n\n“They thought they had to teach procedures, and then realized they could teach in this open, visual, creative way,\" Boaler said. \"A lot of research studies suggest that it takes a long time for changes to come about. In this one, it was quick.”\n\nMake high school math reflect real life\n\nBeyond data science, some districts design courses that include more real-world math and topics such as financial algebra and mathematical modeling.\n\nThe approach has led other countries to success. Teens in the Netherlands post some of the strongest math scores in the world on the PISA assessment. That's largely because the exam prioritizes the application of mathematical concepts to real-life situations, and the Dutch teach math rooted in reality and relevant to society.\n\nSome longtime Dutch math experts were involved in the design of PISA, which began in 2000 and is given every three years to a sample of 15-year-old students in developed countries and economies.\n\nAt Sweetwater High School in Chula Vista, California, math teacher Melody Morris teaches a new 12th grade course that explores topics such as two-player games, graph theory, sequences and series and cryptography. The course, called Discrete Math, was developed through a partnership with San Diego State University.\n\nIn one exercise, Morris teaches students to play a capture-the-flag style game featured on the television show \"Survivor.\" They learn that by using math, they can win every time.\n\n'Survivor: Winners at War':Previous champs compete in Season 40\n\n“Their typical response is: ‘This is math?’ ” Morris said. “They think it’s about playing games and having fun. But what they’re really learning is how to break down large problems into small ones and how to make hypotheses and test them.”\n\nStudents at Sweetwater still rise up through the traditional “geometry sandwich” from ninth through 11th grades. Morris said many who choose her class senior year find themselves much more engaged in the material. They develop a toolkit that will allow them to approach any problem in life, Morris said.\n\n“A lot of what we’re building is habits of mind,” she said.\n\nWho's best at tech and engineering?

The schools represent about 9% of American Bar Association-accredited law schools and include for-profits, independent colleges and public law schools affiliated with large state schools.\n\nThe vast majority of law school graduates, 85%, take the bar exam once, according to a study by the National Conference of Bar Examiners that looked at data over five years. About 9% took the test twice.\n\nLess than 1% took the exam more than five times. A few refused to give up. The study found nine graduates who took the test 11 times.\n\nGoldstein took the Bar exam six times in his home state of California, which has one of the nation's toughest exams. In July 2018, nearly 6 out of 10 graduates failed.\n\nThe last two times he's taken the exam, Goldstein has flown to Illinois, which accepts a lower passing score than California.\n\nSome states limit the number of attempts a graduate can make at passing the exam; California and Illinois do not.\n\nLaw school struggles\n\nGoldstein graduated from Arizona Summit Law School in Phoenix, which has struggled to prepare its graduates to pass the bar exam.\n\nThe private school, owned by a for-profit company, had the lowest bar passage rate in the nation among American Bar Association-accredited schools for its 2015 graduates, ABA data show. Only 60% of Arizona Summit alums passed the bar exam within two years of graduating, compared to 88% nationwide, the ABA data show.\n\nThe ABA put Arizona Summit on probation in March 2017 and required the school to develop an improvement plan.\n\nDespite efforts to turn the school around, enrollment has dwindled. The loss of students and ongoing problems with ABA prompted Arizona Summit officials to abruptly cancel classes in August. A few weeks later, they announced plans to close the school after current students graduate in spring 2020.\n\nBut as low as Arizona Summit's bar passage rates were, they were never out of compliance with the ABA's standards.\n\nMORE: Students of struggling law school now told they can't all finish degrees at ASU\n\nThose standards allow law schools to demonstrate compliance in a couple of ways. In Arizona Summit's case, it used exam scores going back five years even though its scores were on the decline.\n\nThose standards could soon change. The ABA is considering revising them to require at least 75% of a school's graduates who take the exam to pass it within two years.\n\nSchools that fall below the standard would risk having their ABA-accreditation revoked.\n\nABA officials say the proposed change would encourage law schools to provide more services, such as tutoring or bar-prep courses, to help their students pass the bar. They also hope it will deter schools from admitting large numbers of lower-achieving students, who are more likely to struggle with the bar exam.\n\nBar exam called 'passable'\n\nGoldstein supports tougher standards. He believes it would help schools to focus on getting their students to pass the exam.\n\nArizona Summit officials acknowledge the difficulties their graduates have passing the exam, but said they have offered resources to help them prepare, including a bar-exam prep program and referrals to tutors.\n\n\"The bar examination is passable,\" said Don Lively, Arizona Summit's founding dean who stepped down as school president in 2018. \"The key determinants are grit, stamina and dedicated study.\"\n\nFifty-two percent of Arizona Summit graduates passed the Arizona State Bar Exam on the first try in July 2018, the most recent round of the test, an improvement from 26% the previous year.\n\nRepeat test-takers continued to struggle.

Responding officers eventually entered the room and a Border Patrol officer fatally shot him.\n\nThe heinous attack came just two days before students were set to be released for the summer and left a community – and nation – asking yet again: Who would do this, and why?\n\nAn examination of Ramos’ personal background reveals a bullied loner with no criminal history and – like so many other mass shooters in America – an interest in and access to high-powered firearms and ammunition in a political system that prioritizes gun rights.\n\nHe purchased guns and ammo the week before\n\nThe profile image from an Instagram account tied to the suspected Uvalde shooter, identified as Salvador Ramos.

The photo was posted as a story under the username “salv8dor_.” Multiple classmates confirmed the account belonged to the suspected gunman.\n\nHe shot his grandmother and crashed vehicle before entering school\n\nThe shooting spree began Tuesday prior to Ramos arriving at Robb Elementary. Ramos first shot his grandmother at her home and then fled the scene, authorities said. The grandmother was airlifted to a hospital and was being treated in serious condition, officials said Wednesday.\n\n“The first thing that happened was the gunman shot his grandmother … She then contacted police. The gunman fled, and as he was fleeing had an accident just outside the elementary school,” Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe suspect crashed his vehicle into what appears to be a flood control channel near the elementary school and emerged with a rifle and a backpack while wearing a tactical vest that holds extra ammunition, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Sgt. Erick Estrada said.\n\nA police vehicle is seen parked near a truck believed to belong to the suspect on May 24, 2022. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nRamos moved toward the school and entered through a back door, DPS Director Steven McCraw said.\n\nThe door had just been propped open by a teacher about a minute before Ramos’ truck crashed near the school, McCraw said at a briefing Friday, citing video evidence.\n\nInitially, authorities said a school resource officer “engaged” him, but no shots were fired.\n\nOn Thursday, DPS Regional Director Victor Escalon offered a different account of what happened, saying Ramos walked into the school without any confrontation from officers.\n\nMcCraw said at a news conference Friday that when two men at a nearby funeral home heard Ramos’ truck crash, they went to see what happened. But when they saw a man with a gun get out of the truck, they ran. Ramos fired at them, but did not hit either man, McCraw said.\n\nVideo inside the school shows a teacher grab her phone and she “apparently calls 911,” McCraw said. The teacher tells dispatchers that there was a crash outside and a man with a gun.\n\nRamos then walked toward the school and began shooting at the building while officers arrived at the funeral home, McCraw said. The patrol car then sped toward the school, but drove right past the shooter, who was “hunkered down” between cars in the parking lot.\n\nAt 11:33 a.m. local time, Ramos entered the school through the propped-open door and began shooting into the first classroom. He “shot more than 100 rounds based on the audio evidence at that time,” McCraw said. In total, hundreds of shots were fired in just four minutes.\n\nThe suspect then barricaded himself in a classroom and an adjoining classroom. All of the 19 children and two teachers killed were in those rooms, DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said.\n\nA total of seven officers were on scene within minutes, including six Uvalde Police officers and a county deputy sheriff, according to McCraw. Two of the officers received grazing wounds from the suspect. Eventually, a total of 19 officers were on scene.\n\n“The initial group of officers that were on scene, at that point, they were at a point of disadvantage because the shooter was able to barricade himself inside that classroom. There was not sufficient manpower at that time and their main, their primary focus was preserve any further loss of life,” Olivarez said. “So they started breaking windows around the school, and trying to rescue, evacuate children and teachers while that was going on.”\n\nNearly an hour later, a specialized tactical team entered the locked classroom using keys obtained from the janitor and fatally shot the suspect, McCraw said. One officer was shot and had a non-life-threatening injury, he added.\n\nMcCraw explained the delay in entering by saying the officers on scene had switched from active shooter mode to trying to address someone who had barricaded himself in the classroom and may have been trying to entice officers to enter.\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision, period. There’s no excuse for that,” McCraw said.\n\nUvalde firefighter Chip King told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that it took about 30 minutes after he arrived on the scene for the gunman to be neutralized by law enforcement.\n\nThe shooter was on the premises for up to an hour before law enforcement forcibly entered a classroom and killed him, officials said Wednesday. “It’s going to be within, like 40 minutes or something, (within) an hour,” McCraw said.\n\nInvestigators found one of the suspect’s rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school with the suspect, Whitmire said, citing the ATF. The gunman’s other rifle was left in the truck that crashed, along with 15 magazines, according to McCraw.\n\nMcCraw said 58 magazines were found at the school – 11 inside the school, three on the shooter’s body, two in Room 112, six in Room 111, five on the ground, and one was in the rifle.

There were another two magazines found at his home, for a total of 60.\n\nHe had a total of 1,657 rounds of ammunition, McCraw said.\n\nRamos’ grandfather, Rolando Reyes, told CNN on Thursday that he knows many of the families whose loved ones endured the mass shooting.\n\nSome of them are my friends, and I’m going to have to face them some day,” Reyes said.\n\nReyes’ wife, the shooter’s grandmother, suffered from a bullet that pierced her jaw and upper cheek and will undergo significant reconstructive surgery. Reyes said he doesn’t understand why Ramos shot his grandmother, who took care of him.\n\nHe was a local student with few if any friends\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

He had no friends and had no criminal history or gang affiliation, he added.\n\nHe worked the day shift at a local Wendy’s and kept mostly to himself, the restaurant’s manager confirmed to CNN.\n\n“He felt like the quiet type, the one who doesn’t say much. He didn’t really socialize with the other employees,” Wendy’s evening manager Adrian Mendes said. “He just worked, got paid, and came in to get his check.”\n\nA former classmate of the gunman said Ramos “would get severely bullied and made fun of a lot” and was taunted by others for the clothes he wore and his family’s financial situation. “People would, like, actually call him school shooter and stuff like that,” he said.\n\nThe classmate, who did not want to be identified by name, said he was somewhat “close” to Ramos. They sat together through high school and played Xbox together, he said.\n\nThe suspect had stopped attending school regularly and they communicated less, aside from occasional invites to play Xbox. Recently, the suspect sent the classmate a picture of an AR-15, a backpack with rounds of ammunition and several gun magazines, he added.\n\n“I was like, ‘Bro, why do you have this?’ and he was like, ‘Don’t worry about it,’” the friend said. “He proceeded to text me, ‘I look very different now. You wouldn’t recognize me.’”\n\nStanley Torres, a senior at Uvalde High School, told CNN he shared a gym class with Ramos and described him as a “very quiet person who hung out by himself.” Another Uvalde High senior told CNN she “knew people didn’t like him. People would make fun of him or want to fight him,” but she said she wasn’t sure why.\n\nAccording to one former friend and a video obtained by CNN, the shooter had a history of physically fighting with others. The former friend and classmate said Ramos sent him the video on Snapchat more than a year ago. It depicts the shooter fighting with someone else, which the former friend said was not out of the ordinary, adding, “he would always get in fights in school.”\n\nTwo other former classmates told CNN the person in the video is Ramos.\n\nThe suspect had no known mental health history, Abbott said.\n\nHe made warnings on social media messages\n\nHours before the shooting, the gunman made a series of ominous messages on different social media sites.\n\nThe Instagram account that was linked to Ramos posted a photo of two rifles lying on a carpet and also tagged another Instagram account by name in the photo. The owner of the tagged Instagram account wrote in a story posted after the shooting that the suspect had tagged her and messaged her out of the blue.\n\nThe girl, who did not include her name on her account and has since made her account private, posted screenshots of messages that she said she exchanged with the shooter in the days before the massacre.\n\nIn one, Ramos wrote “I’m about to” – but didn’t say what he would do. “I got a lil secret,” he wrote in another message. “I wanna tell u.” She responded she might take a nap soon but would respond if she was awake.\n\nIn messages posted to her story before it went private, the girl said that she didn’t live in Texas and didn’t know Ramos.\n\n“Tthe only reason i responded to him was because i was afraid of him i wish i stayed awake to at least try to convince him to not commit his crime,” she wrote. “I didnt know.”\n\nAbbott said the gunman wrote about his intentions on Facebook. A spokesman for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said the gunman’s private one-to-one messages were discovered after the shooting.\n\nAbbott said that in the first of three messages, about 30 minutes before the school shooting, Ramos wrote, “I’m going to shoot my grandmother.”\n\nShortly after, he wrote, “I shot my grandmother.”\n\nAnd finally: “I’m going to shoot an elementary school.”\n\nHe allegedly sent similarly chilling text messages to a girl he met online describing how he had just shot his grandmother and was going to shoot up an elementary school.\n\nThe 15-year-old girl, who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, said she began chatting with Ramos on a social media app on May 9. She said she spoke daily on FaceTime with him and also communicated with him on other apps.\n\nIn their conversations, she said he asked about her life in Germany. “He looked happy and comfortable talking to me,” the girl said. She said he told her he spent a lot of time alone at home.\n\nThere were other text messages, however, that alarmed her. In one case, she said, he told her that he “threw dead cats at people’s houses.”\n\nShe said she got the impression that he kept to himself.\n\n“Every time I talked to him,” she said, “he never had plans with his friends.”\n\nIn other group messages on Instagram from February, there was talk of Ramos being a school shooter, McCraw said. In March, there were more group chats on Instagram about Ramos buying a gun. McCraw said that last year Ramos had asked his sister to buy him a gun “but she flatly refused.”\n\nCorrection: Previous versions of this article had the wrong name for state Sen.

The Shoals Dream Center is envisioned as a hub for an array of services to aid the area’s families, The TimesDaily reports. Among them: providing food; academic tutoring and mentoring for at-risk kids. The center also plans to offer addiction recovery resources and life skills training. The Shoals Dream Center is an extension of the Chapel church. The social services components will offer after-school programs where students can engage in learning and developmental training, activities, and games three days per week, says Toyia Gourley, director of the Dream Center Academy. The food distribution is set up in the style of a supermarket, the newspaper reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state agency overseeing air quality has agreed to submit a cleanup plan by mid-December for this city that has some of the nation’s most polluted winter air. A federal court judge, as part of a lawsuit, approved an agreement that set the deadline for the cleanup plan to be submitted by the state Department of Environmental Conservation to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Judge Thomas Zilly also approved a mid-January deadline for the EPA to make sure the plan complete. Clean air advocates sued in December, saying the state failed to submit a legally compliant plan to address particulate pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and other sources. Fine particulate is a pollutant that can cause heart and lung problems.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has announced it is changing its abbreviation from UA to UArizona in an effort to increase search engine optimization results for the college. The Tucson-based college in a statement Monday said the change would help distinguish the school from other national and international entities that use UA, including the University of Alabama, Under Armour and United Airlines. Officials say the southern Arizona school was not appearing high on Google results for “UA.” University officials say the college will now use UArizona for its communications. The college had already changed its Twitter handle to @uarizona. Officials say there are not yet any plans to use the new abbreviation on college merchandise or in chants at sporting events.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: An Arkansas State University alumnus says he was surprised to spot a few curious critters running around the campus library. Codie Clark, a math tutor, says he spotted at least two raccoons Sunday on the third floor of the university’s Dean B. Ellis Library while waiting for a student to arrive for a tutoring session. Clark says other students then cornered one raccoon. Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communications Bill Smith told KAIT-TV that the school’s facility management personnel humanely trapped the animals after being notified by library staff. Clark says an animal rescuer released the racoons back into the wild that night. Smith noted the raccoons likely came to campus because of recent rain. He encouraged anyone who encounters wild animals to contact the Facilities Management Department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some of the country’s largest ride-sharing companies proposed a state law Tuesday that would let them continue to treat drivers as independent contractors while also guaranteeing them a minimum wage and money for health insurance. The Legislature enacted legislation this year requiring such companies to treat drivers as employees, which would let them form a union and entitle them to benefits. But the law proposed Tuesday would exempt ride-sharing companies. The proposal must be approved by voters. If passed, it would supersede the Legislature’s action and any similar ordinances by local governments. It also would prevent lawmakers from passing another law to block it. The proposal will only get on the November 2020 ballot if supporters can gather about 660,000 signatures. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have already pledged $90 million to support the effort, making it one of the most expensive ballot measures ever.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Hundreds of state employees have prepared to have their emails eliminated to remove access to government records that would otherwise be public. The Denver Post reports the affected employees work for the Department of Regulatory Agencies, which regulates state industries including insurance, banks, electric utilities and real estate. Officials say the department’s 600 employees were notified multiple times of the upcoming purge set to begin Friday. Department officials say employees were instructed to preserve any vital emails, including pending litigation or existing open records requests. Officials say the purge is to ensure department emails are easily searchable. Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition says deletion of electronic records is a major problem for those seeking information. Colorado law gives state departments broad discretion in crafting their record-keeping policies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed an executive order that creates an entity charged with coming up with a plan for better coordination between state government agencies and the business community. The Democrat says he has a goal of transforming a workforce development system that’s currently designed to meet the needs of 20th-century jobs into one that serves 21st-century jobs. He says the state’s education and training system today is “too static and disconnected,” and there’s a need for better collaboration with business and labor so Connecticut’s teachers know what skills to teach. Lamont announced the creation of the Governor’s Workforce Council at Naugatuck Community College on Tuesday.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal magistrate is recommending dismissal of a lawsuit against Delaware State University officials by a woman who says she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. The magistrate ruled Tuesday that the revised lawsuit by Mai-Ajah Keel is time-barred and that Keel has failed to state a claim. Keel says after she reported the assault in 2013, she was met with deliberate indifference by school officials and harassment and retaliation by her alleged attacker and other students. Keel’s alleged attacker, Jason Faustin, was charged in 2015 with fourth-degree rape. The charges were later dropped, but Faustin was suspended from campus after a school panel found him “responsible” for sexual assault. Faustin later served as an intern in the Dover office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: There was glam; there were costumes; there were high heels and a race. In a D.C. tradition that has made a statement since the 1980s, the 33rd Annual 17th Street High Heel Race took off Tuesday evening with a parade and race near Dupont Circle, WUSA-TV reports. The event is the district’s second-largest annual LGBTQ community event, filled with cheer as costumed drag queens and other participants race down the street. It was originally started by a group of 25 drag queens who decided to sprint down the road and strut their stuff. This year, the event brought out thousands of residents and visitors to join in on the fun. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser made an appearance at the event, serving as the grand marshal to kick off the celebration.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A memorial for the Pulse nightclub massacre will have a reflecting pool with rainbow-colored lines radiating from it, and a nearby museum will resemble a three-dimensional spirograph, according to design concepts announced Wednesday. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials are moving forward with plans for some new parks in the city. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that the City Council last week approved the purchase of land from The Conservation Fund for a park in the Home Park neighborhood. The city will buy the land for a little more than $200,000. City officials also approved funding to purchase two properties for the $40 million Rodney Cook Sr. Park currently under construction in the Vine City neighborhood. The AJC says the park will feature 18 sculptures memorializing civil rights heroes, including Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Big Island neighborhood that was ravaged by the 2018 Kilauea volcano eruption has become a destination for tourists wanting to get a look at the damage caused by one of the largest eruptions in the volcano’s recent history. But the Hawaii Tribune Herald reports residents of the Leilani Estates neighborhood consider the visitors a nuisance and are relieved to see interest beginning to wane. Tourism increased as residents were trying to return to their homes and property after being forced to evacuate. More than 700 homes were destroyed. Leilani Estates Community Association president Andy Andrews says the number of tourists has fallen significantly since earlier this year, and there are fewer confrontations between locals and visitors, who he says ignore warning signs and parking rules.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Latino students make up 18% of the enrollment in the state’s public schools, but their achievement scores continue to lag state averages. The Idaho Statesman reports researchers and state officials say improving Latino students’ outcomes is an urgent need because of their importance to the state’s workforce. The Idaho Department of Education has set long-term goals to improve Latino outcomes. However, the department has left strategy for reaching those goals to districts and schools with little success in two years. Latino students are recording lower-than-average test scores and fewer postsecondary degrees. Rod Gramer, the CEO of Idaho Business for education, says if the Latino students are not successful, Idaho is not going to be successful.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the mayor adds school days to cover that lost time. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union’s top leadership of “moving the goal posts” by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her Tuesday. “Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,” Lightfoot said heatedly. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year. Union President Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues.\n\nIndiana\n\nSeymour: John Mellencamp, the subject of a new mural in his hometown, endorsed the project by adding a few significant brushstrokes Tuesday afternoon. Indiana rock star Mellencamp painted his initials, “JJM,” on the exterior of a music store in Seymour, the community he immortalized in 1985 hit “Small Town.” Artist Pamela Bliss says Mellencamp was reserved and appreciative during his surprise visit, but he also flashed his signature ornery demeanor when Bliss offered a small paintbrush after he agreed to sign the work. “He said, ‘You call that a (expletive) brush? Give me another one,’ ” Bliss said, laughing. “I got a little piece of the real John right there.” Bliss says she’s a fan of Mellencamp’s paintings, some of which are currently on display at the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts in Seymour and at ACA Galleries in New York City.\n\nIowa\n\nWaukee: Authorities are investigating another explosion at a gender reveal party that happened one day after a blast at a similar gathering killed a 56-year-old woman in a nearby community. Authorities say no one was injured in the explosion Sunday in rural Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, but they are looking into unconfirmed claims that the blast broke a neighbor’s windows. Waukee Fire Capt. Tomme Tysdal says the Waukee explosion came from a commercially available gender reveal kit, unlike the homemade device that killed Pamela Kreimeyer on Saturday near Knoxville, a town 45 miles away. Authorities say Kreimeyer died instantly when her family’s device exploded, hitting her in the head from 45 feet away.\n\nKansas\n\nDodge City: A monkey that was injured last month trying to protect his offspring from being taken by an intruder during an apparent break-in at a zoo has died. Officials at the Wright Park Zoo say the 32-year-old tufted capuchin monkey was found unresponsive early Tuesday. City spokeswoman Abbey Martin says the zoo’s veterinarian was unable to revive the monkey, named Vern. The Hutchinson News reports a necropsy will be done to determine the cause of death. Vern underwent surgery for broken bones after the Sept. 3 break-in. A younger monkey named Pickett was found loose within the city limits and returned to the zoo. Vern and a female monkey named Charro arrived at the zoo in 1988. Their two youngest sons, Jack and Pickett, are part of the zoo’s current capuchin troop.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: Murray State University students are using GPS devices to track box turtles and learn about the technology’s value. Assistant wildlife biology professor Andrea Darracq says students work in the classroom to build the tracking devices and go into the field at an off-campus university property to locate the turtles. The university says the turtles are tracked with the GPS devices and a transmitter, allowing the students to determine a turtle’s location with a receiver and compare it to more precise GPS readings. The school says the capturing and marking of turtles was done with approval from its Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee and a state educational wildlife collection permit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A $2.1 million research project at Tulane University is aimed at helping members of an American Indian tribe cope with climate change and economic inequality. In a news release, Tulane says the project aims to benefit the United Houma Nation. Challenges facing the south Louisiana tribe include coastal land loss that threatens fishing, trapping and even some homes. Part of the project will involve examining how tribal citizens move within and outside the state to manage these and other challenges. Tulane’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine was awarded the project by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program.\n\nMaine\n\nGardiner: It looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and – if it gets a prosthetic leg – will once again walk like a duck. Loni Hamner, of Gardiner, recently adopted a female Mallard duck that was left with one leg and a stump after being attacked by a fox last year. Hamner says the duck she’s named Faith can hop and hobble around, but she wants her “to have a good duck quality of life and do all the things ducks like to do.” The Bangor Daily News reports that a query on the Maine Poultry Connection Facebook page led Hamner to the University of Maine Advanced Structure and Composites Center. Lab manager Paul Bussiere says he’ll create a prosthetic leg for Faith for free in his spare time.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Exelon Corp., the energy company that runs the Conowingo Dam, will invest more than $200 million in environmental projects, according to an agreement announced Tuesday by Gov. Larry Hogan. Officials have been focusing on how to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials also are concerned that sediment buildup behind the dam’s walls could be released and wreak havoc on the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The money in the proposed settlement will be used to improve water quality in the Lower Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, Hogan said. Parts of the agreement will be submitted for approval to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as part of the licensing renewal for the dam.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCarver: The cranberry industry is looking to solar power for relief as it struggles with plummeting fruit prices. Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the nation’s second-largest grower after Wisconsin, are proposing to build solar panels above their bogs. Jordan Macknick, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, says the novel approach to blending solar production with crop cultivation is being researched but hasn’t been tried before on a large scale anywhere in the world. Michael Wainio, a Massachusetts cranberry farmer proposing one of the projects, says revenue from solar power is essential to maintaining his family’s farm near Cape Cod. University of Massachusetts researchers have launched a study to examine the idea. Opponents argue there would be long-term environmental consequences.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The funeral for John Conyers, who served more than 50 years in Congress, will be held Monday at a church in the city. The public will get a chance to show their respect for Conyers on Saturday and Sunday at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Conyers died Sunday at age 90, two years after resigning from the U.S. House. Monica Conyers tells The Detroit News that her husband’s funeral will be held at Greater Grace Temple. She anticipates former President Bill Clinton will attend, along with elected officials. On Twitter, Clinton called Conyers a “champion for justice & equality.” Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and is credited with creating the federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Data show that the University of Minnesota’s 2019 freshmen class is the biggest in 50 years and includes the most students of color in the school’s history. The Minnesota Daily reports the Office of Institutional Research’s numbers reveal that most freshmen – about 54% – are female. In 2010, 18% of the freshman class was students of color. Now, minority students make up more than a quarter of this year’s class. Vice provost and dean of the school’s Office of Undergraduate Education Bob McMaster says part of the rise is due to changes in Minnesota high schools, which have seen demographic shifts in recent years. Still, the number of black students remains relatively small. About 5% of new students are black, up slightly from over 4% a decade ago.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With the nationwide closure of Fred’s Pharmacy, one county is taking it really hard. The residents of Kemper County in east-central Mississippi now find themselves without any pharmacy in the entire county. Residents will have to place and pick up prescriptions at pharmacies in Meridian or Philadelphia – about a 30-minute drive to each one. Mississippi Board of Pharmacy President Ryan Harper says that will be an issue for some of the state’s most critical patients. He says patients on multiple prescriptions also usually have a huge hurdle of having access to reliable transportation. Fred’s closed Oct. 18. It was located in the county seat, Dekalb, with a population of just over 1,000 residents.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor is proposing an ordinance aimed at helping police keep firearms away from those with a history of domestic violence. The Kansas Star reports that the ordinance Quinton Lucas unveiled Wednesday would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists, but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases. Lucas and his staff wrote the proposal with help from the Rose Brooks Center, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Shelter victim advocate Annie Struby says more than half of the most dangerous domestic abusers in Kansas City have access to firearms.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has spent more than $2 million on snow plowing so far this year, surpassing what costs were by this date for the past two years. The Independent Record reports snow plowing costs for the state Department of Transportation increased by more than 250% since last year. Department officials say they spent $575,577 from July 1 to Oct. 28 last year and $544,872 during the same period in 2017. Officials say record snowstorms have hit large regions just days into the fall season, breaking decades­long snowfall records in cities like Great Falls. Officials say about 277,800 miles have been plowed so far this season. Only a quarter of that was plowed this time last year. Officials say costs include labor, operating equipment and materials.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Officials have begun the process to get the city’s downtown placed on the National Register of Historic Places. City officials convened an open house Monday to review the federal and state historic-district guidelines with members of an Omaha planning firm and the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office. Omaha-based RDG will prepare North Platte’s nomination papers. Stephanie Rose, an urban planner for the firm, says residents are welcome to share their thoughts and historic information with her over the coming months. If the U.S. National Park Service adds downtown North Platte to the register, buildings that are at least 50 years old within the district could qualify for federal and state historic tax credits to help pay for rehabilitation projects.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos took in nearly $1.06 billion in winnings last month – a high for 2019 and a record for September in a key index of state fiscal health. Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton attributes Wednesday’s healthy “gaming win” report to an increase in slot machine play and results from Las Vegas Strip and Clark County casinos. Lawton says a 6.8% increase in the monthly figure compared with the same month a year ago was the fourth straight increase in the year-to-year comparison. The state took in almost $66.4 million in taxes on the September 2019 figures. The $1.059 billion tally topped the previous September best of $1.058 billion in 2007 by just $100,000. October 2007 was the best month ever for casino winnings, at $1.165 billion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University System of New Hampshire has announced that tuition for in-state students will be frozen in place for the 2020-2021 academic year. The Concord Monitor reports that the state board of trustees announced Tuesday that it had unanimously voted to freeze tuition for undergraduate students. The freeze will go into effect for students at the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College and Granite State College. The New Hampshire House recently increased the state’s appropriation to the university system by $12 million over two years to freeze tuition. Gov. Chris Sununu called the announcement a “big win for New Hampshire students.” This is the system’s first tuition freeze since 2013.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodbridge: A small plane crashed through the roof of a home Tuesday, killing the pilot and causing an explosion that set two houses ablaze in a New Jersey suburb of New York City. No one was in the home in which the Cessna 414 crashed, but flames spread to another house, where a woman escaped injury, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac said. The plane went down about 11 a.m. not far from an elementary school, according to National Transportation Safety Board investigator Adam Gerhardt. The crash sent flames into the air, belched smoke for hours and left neighbors thinking the earth was shaking. Gerhardt said the pilot was flying using instrument flight rules typically used by experienced pilots when flying with reduced visibility. The weather in the area was cloudy and misty at the time of the crash.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. House has approved legislation that would prohibit oil and gas development on federal land surrounding a national park held sacred by numerous Native American tribes. The vote came Wednesday to make permanent a buffer around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico says there are some areas where drilling should not take place, and the area around Chaco is one of them. Aside from prohibiting new permits and canceling any existing nonproducing leases, the measure suggests additional studies and protective measures should be taken to address health, safety and environmental effects on nearby communities and tribal interests. The area includes land belonging to the Navajo Nation and individual tribal members. The legislation does not affect those parcels.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that bans restaurants and grocery stores from selling foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose, considered a culinary delicacy for centuries. The bill, expected to be signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, would forbid the sale of the French specialty starting in 2022. Animal welfare activists had campaigned for a ban on the grounds that the methods used to produce foie gras are cruel, involving force-feeding a bird a corn-based mixture through a tube slipped down its throat. Farmers who produce foie gras – meaning fatty liver in French – say the birds are treated humanely and don’t suffer during the fattening process. The council vote was 42-6 for the final version of the bill that calls for a fine of up to $2,000 for each violation. With about 1,000 New York restaurants offering foie gras, top chefs did not take kindly to the news, including Momofuku’s David Chang, who called it “idiocracy.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSpencer: The state has received a federal grant to renovate a 1920s rail car that was built to comply with the racist Jim Crow laws of the 20th century. State officials say the National Park Service awarded a grant of more than $287,000 to renovate the railroad car that’s now at the N.C. Transportation Museum in Spencer. The 44-seat coach hasn’t been used since 1969. The car has 22 seats in the rear that were designated for African Americans so that it complied with segregation laws. It needs extensive renovation, including asbestos removal. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources says it’s one of few such cars held by a museum for public viewing. Another one is at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor is retracting an audit critical of the city of Williston after officials provided more information to the state. Auditor Josh Gallion issued the audit report Monday but retracted it late Tuesday. Gallion says the audit “highlighted several areas of concern,” including a violation of the state’s open meetings law and $92 million in airport contracts that were not disclosed in financial statements. Gallion says the city auditor signed off on the report last week. But Gallion says the city has now provided more information for review. Gallion says auditors are reviewing the new information and will issue a revised audit later.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal civil rights lawsuit says a 10-year-old Muslim boy was questioned about his patriotism and religious beliefs by a student teacher at a school outside Cleveland and was ordered to undress to determine whether his parents had abused him. The lawsuit filed last week says the boy’s teacher, the student teacher and a nurse for the Lakeview Local School District in Cortland held him against his will in a room last November and coerced him into saying he’d been disciplined by his mother with a belt. Family attorney Matthew Abens says a county children’s services investigation quickly determined there was no wrongdoing by his parents. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the boy is being treated for trauma.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials say the frequency of congenital syphilis cases has risen sharply in the state during the past five years and continues to increase. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Tuesday that the state has experienced a 283% increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases among women since 2014 and a 92% increase since last year. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact, but health officials say congenital syphilis can be transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, birth defects and death. Officials say health care providers should test pregnant women for the disease early in their pregnancy and again early in the third trimester.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The number of wolves in the state is growing, but not particularly fast. State biologists tallied a minimum of 124 wolves statewide last year, according to the annual wolf report released Wednesday. The number represented an 11% increase over the previous year, but only a growth of 14 animals since 2015. Four wolves were killed illegally in 2017, and another five were killed due to conflict with livestock. Wolves continued to expand their territory. A pair of resident wolves were documented in the Mount Hood area for the first time, meaning the apex predator has a foothold in every region of the state except the coast. Oregon is home to at least 12 wolf packs, according to the report, including 11 that have a breeding male and female with at least two pups that survived the winter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBethlehem: A prosecutor says he will recommend dismissal of charges against a woman authorities say handed her 1-month-old baby to a bus driver and walked away in tears. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Wednesday that 26-year-old Ashley Walters “clearly has some mental health issues.” He said she had displayed combative and erratic behavior and would be involuntarily committed for treatment. Walters was charged with child endangerment after authorities said she boarded a bus in Bethlehem, placed her son on the farebox and told the driver to call police because “this was her son that she can’t take care of.” Pennsylvania’s Safe Haven Law allows babies up to 28 days old to be left at a hospital or police station. Morganelli says Walters’ baby was 32 days old.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has come up with what it calls a “climate justice plan” to reduce its carbon footprint while accounting for the needs of low-income and minority neighborhoods. The plan unveiled Friday by the city’s Office of Sustainability and Racial and Environmental Justice Committee includes getting 100% of municipal buildings’ electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and making all city vehicles and school buses run on renewable energy by 2040. Priorities outlined in the 88-page plan include planting more trees and expanding green spaces; investing in bike paths, trails and sidewalk improvements; and eliminating food waste. The plan says neighborhoods with the largest populations of people of color and lowest median incomes have the most pollution, the severe health effects from environmental causes, and the least amount of green space.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Environmental groups are taking steps toward suing a company they say is responsible for polluting the state’s waters with tiny plastic beads. News outlets report the groups represented by Southern Environmental Law Center sent Frontier Logistics a 60-day legal notice Monday on grounds it violated the Clean Water Act. The state environmental control department cited Frontier in July after the plastic bits, called nurdles, were found in its facility and thought to be the same ones spilled onto Sullivan’s Island. Environmental groups say they’re still washing up. But Frontier’s vice president contends the nurdles can’t be traced to it. An environmental control spokeswoman said Frontier installed preventative measures, so the agency closed the matter. The pellets are turned into plastic products, and environmentalists say marine animals mistake them for food.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: University leaders tell state lawmakers they’re working to implement a new law aimed at ensuring free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. A legislative committee summoned regents and university presidents to a meeting Wednesday to detail their efforts to comply with the law. Its passage last spring came after controversy over a “Hawaiian Day” party theme at the University of South Dakota revived conservative lawmakers’ complaints about political correctness on campus. The university presidents said they’re holding trainings for students and faculty on protecting speech. They say they’re also working to gauge students’ experiences on campus. The Board of Regents is required to give a written report on its implementation of the law by Dec. 1.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: You’ve heard of a pumpkin being turned into a carriage, but what about into a boat? Justin Ownby has tried for years to grow the perfect giant pumpkin, with limited success. This year, though, he outdid himself. “We’ve pumpkin spiced everything else; why not pumpkin spice a boat?” he said. Ownby, 36, owns a family farm in Cleveland with his wife, Christin, 32, and their four children. A massive pumpkin in his patch grew to more than 900 pounds and several feet across this year, big enough to carve out space for a grown man to sit inside it and paddle across a pond – before it sank under him. “It’s fish food now,” Ownby said with a laugh. “There’s catfish in there. They’ll make short work of that thing.”\n\nTexas\n\nHarlingen: The critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle had an offseason for nesting this year along beaches in the state, with 190 nests recorded in Texas. The Valley Morning Star reports the number, which covers a geographic area from the Bolivar Peninsula south to Boca Chica beach, was down from 250 nests logged last year and 353 in 2017. But this year’s sharp drop-off in Kemp’s ridley nesting in Mexico has set off yellow-flag alerts among scientists who track and study the species. The Texas nesting numbers were not necessarily poor by the standards of the past decade, and they tend to fluctuate because adult females don’t return to their home beach every year to lay a clutch of eggs. Recent studies show female Kemp’s ridleys may come back to nest at three-plus-year intervals.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state liquor commission has announced it is running out of bar licenses for potential business owners again after a similar shortage two years ago. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control handed out its last 2019 bar permits Tuesday to two establishments in Lehi and West Valley City. Department authorities say five other business were placed on the waiting list, some of them planning to open in November and December. Officials say businesses must wait for a population increase after applying due to a state law allowing one bar for every 10,200 people. Officials say three permits are expected before July 2020 following new population information. Some owners say the Legislature should review the population quota.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has named a new poet laureate. Republican Gov. Phil Scott appointed Mary Ruefle to the honorary position this week. WCAX-TV reports she was recommended by a panel of judges. The poet laureate is picked every four years and serves as the state’s ambassador for the art of poetry, participating in ceremonies and readings in Vermont and nationwide. Ruefle said at the ceremony Monday that she was honored to join the ranks of those who served before her and was humbled and scared. She said she’s used to that and said that’s how she feels in the face of poetry and as “a member of that tribe.” Chard Deniord was the state’s last poet laureate. Robert Frost served as Vermont’s first in 1961.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats hoping to seize control of the Legislature in next month’s elections say passing the long-stalled Equal Rights Amendment will be a top priority next year. Passed by Congress in 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, explicitly enshrining equality for women in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty-seven states have ratified it, and advocates say having 38 would meet the constitutional threshold for approval, though it would also likely spark court battles over a long-passed ratification deadline and other legal questions. Other states are working toward ratification, but advocates say the once solidly conservative Virginia, where every seat is on the ballot in November, appears closest. The measure has cleared Virginia’s GOP-controlled Senate before but stalled in the House, which Republicans also narrowly control.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: County officials have announced a proposal to turn a jail into a homeless shelter and use an additional sales tax for funding. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports the proposal would convert the 288-bed jail into a multi-care facility named the Yakima County Care Campus. Yakima County commissioners say the 0.3% countywide sales tax that generates more than $3.5 million a year could fund the care facility with commissioner approval. Officials say commissioners are expected to hold a city hall meeting Oct. 29 to decide. Commissioners say the facility would offer mental health services, substance abuse treatment and long-term housing. Officials say an 8,000-square-foot storage building on the jail’s property would be used as permanent shelter. Commissioners expect to fully convert the facility by 2026.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRichwood: An 11-foot python that was on the loose was found Tuesday, about a month after it got out of its tank, broke through a window screen and slithered outside. Richwood Police Chief Charles Burkhamer says a letter carrier saw the snake laying out in the sun next to a roadway Tuesday, about a block away from where it escaped a month ago. Authorities had been scouring the area trying to find the reptile, and Richwood residents had been notified to keep watch over small children and house pets. Burkhamer said he faced a practical question as he looked at the massive snake on the side of the road. “What am I going to do with it?” he wondered. “We didn’t have a dog crate big enough.” So Burkhamer stuck the snake in a trash can for safekeeping until it could be returned to its owner, who has been asked to register the animal with state officials and reinforce the reptile’s tank.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state has the widest achievement gap between black and white students of any state based on results of a test known as the nation’s report card. The National Assessment of Educational Progress test results released Wednesday show no significant change from statewide results a decade ago. However, declining scores for the lowest-performing students resulted in Wisconsin having the widest achievement gap of any state. State superintendent of schools Carolyn Stanford Taylor says the achievement gap is a crisis, and closing the gaps is “imperative for our state.” The test was given to students in fourth and eighth grades last spring. Wisconsin’s scores were higher than the national averages in both grades and in both subjects.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Farmers in the state are wrapping up a difficult year for sugar beets. A cold snap followed by a week of mild temperatures is threatening the harvest in the Bighorn Basin. A freeze followed by a thaw causes liquids to run out and spoil other beets when they’re stacked in piles. It also lowers the sugar content and price for beets. The Cody Enterprise reports a summer hailstorm and rainy weather also made for a difficult year. Farmer Cody Easum says harvest size and sugar content are both low this year. A local beet pile is growing by about 1,200 tons per day, down from 3,000-4,000 tons in a typical year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html", "title": "Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been “arrested” in the context of the civil rights movement – even suggesting this had happened more than once – it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.\n\nBiden’s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones.\n\nThe President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures – sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.\n\nUnlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year.\n\nSo Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes.\n\nHere is a roundup of Biden’s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.\n\nFalse claims about his own past\n\nBiden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods – more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors – that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.\n\nAnd like some of Trump’s tall tales about his past, Biden’s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.\n\nWhile talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” though only for “part of a summer.” This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,” adding, “I got to.” There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).\n\nBiden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled “17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.\n\nBiden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.)\n\nAnd Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community.\n\nAt a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered “spending time at” and “going to” Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue’s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be “the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.”\n\nThere is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a “liaison” with a major adversary.\n\nFalse claims about Afghanistan\n\nBiden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation – further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.\n\nIn August, the President said, “What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?” Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t “gone” – as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan “never made any sense to me” – though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.\n\nIn July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said “the law doesn’t allow” Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn’t true, given the administration’s authority to grant “parole,” and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn’t permitted.\n\nIn December, Biden said in another interview that “I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.” While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start – as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.\n\nFalse claims about the economy\n\nThe state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.\n\nBiden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was “kind of back to what it was before the pandemic”; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.\n\nTo try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody’s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth – wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs.\n\nLater in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody’s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase “longer-term” from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would “ease longer-term inflationary pressures” – leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.\n\nFalse claims about the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nMany of Biden’s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor’s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear.\n\nBut Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.\n\nAt the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that “you’re not going to get Covid” if you’re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President’s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that “if you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in the ICU unit and you’re not going to die”; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people.\n\nBiden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration’s work to get Americans vaccinated – misleadingly playing down the Trump administration’s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.\n\nIn February, Biden claimed that “suicides are up” amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were “over 800,000” vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.\n\nFalse claims in unscripted settings\n\nWhen Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn’t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies – making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.\n\nDuring Biden’s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration.\n\nAnd he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans’ new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/12/teachers-union-strike-pay/1227089002/", "title": "Striking teachers earn high grades in poll. Teachers' unions, less so", "text": "Susan Page, Merdie Nzanga and Caroline Simon\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – An escalating number of teacher strikes across the country last spring, now erupting again as school resumes, has sparked a remarkable reaction from most Americans: support.\n\nBy close to 3-1, those surveyed by USA TODAY and Ipsos Public Affairs said public school teachers have the right to strike, a view held even by the parents whose lives are most disrupted when teachers walk off the job. Six in 10 said teachers aren’t paid fairly, even though higher salaries for them might well mean bigger bills for taxpayers.\n\nThose views by the public bolster the power of teachers to make demands of school districts and state legislatures in what may signal a new era of teacher activism.\n\nThe survey of more than 2,000 adults nationwide launches a USA TODAY project through the 2018-19 school year that will explore the work, the demands and the future of teaching in the United States. It is a profession that faces evolving challenges, from the imperative to raise scores on standardized tests to the need to protect students from the threat of mass school shootings.\n\n“We criminally underpay teachers, and I think that they are not really as respected as they should be,” said Daniel Galluppi, 39, a data manager from Pittsburgh whose children attend public school. He was among those who participated in the poll. “They’re not just child care for children, but they’re teaching these kids how to be successful and productive members of society.”\n\nFrederick Wendt III, 72, a retired hotel manager from Zephyrhills, Florida, agreed. “I basically think that athletes are overpaid and teachers are underpaid,” he said in a follow-up interview, a sentiment echoed by others surveyed.\n\nJust 34 percent said public school teachers were paid fairly; 59 percent said they weren’t. Nearly eight in 10 said teachers have to spend too much of their own money on school supplies.\n\nAnd poll respondents saw education funding as money well spent. More than two-thirds said public schools were worth the tax money that goes into them.\n\nThe online poll, taken Aug. 9-13, has a credibility interval of plus or minus four percentage points.\n\nEarlier this year, teachers staged statewide strikes in West Virginia, Arizona and Oklahoma, and they rallied in Kentucky, North Carolina and Colorado, closing some of the biggest schools. Teachers in about a dozen Washington state districts walked off the job as classes resumed, though many have since gone back to work.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school district, teachers have voted to authorize a strike if negotiators can’t come to an agreement. A walkout there could come as early as next month.\n\nMost of the strikes this spring came in conservative states that tend to have weaker unions and lower spending on education.\n\nMarch 30:Teachers are striking all over. What is going on?\n\nThat red-state revolt pushed some Republican officials to defy party orthodoxy by endorsing increased spending and higher taxes.\n\nIn a nation that sometimes seems split along partisan lines on everything, Democrats and Republicans have similar outlooks on most issues involving teachers – even on the controversial question of strikes. Democrats by an overwhelming 78 percent to 17 percent said teachers have the right to strike. Most Republicans agreed, albeit by a closer 56 percent to 35 percent.\n\nThat said, some opposed the blunt weapon of a walkout, which costs children classroom time and often leave parents scrambling for day care. “I went through two strikes with my kids,” recalled Carol Kulman, 76, a retired medical researcher from New York City. “I really don’t think that’s the answer.”\n\nPROTECTING BAD TEACHERS?\n\nThe support expressed for teachers doesn’t necessarily translate to their unions.\n\nThose surveyed were divided on whether teachers’ unions improve the quality of education: 48 percent said they did; 35 percent said they didn’t. On that, there was a sharp partisan split. Democrats by 43 percentage points said teachers’ unions improve the quality of education; Republicans by 14 points said they didn’t.\n\nEven among Democrats, who tend to be more supportive of organized labor, six of 10 said teachers’ unions make it harder to fire bad teachers. So did three of four Republicans.\n\n“I think there are bad teachers that are allowed to continue in education when they shouldn’t be allowed to,” said Lanaya Gore, 39, a mother in San Antonio who home-schools her children. The unions “keep the bad teachers in,” she said.\n\nThat said, teachers’ unions got a high overall approval rating, 60 percent, just about the same as the 61 percent that local school district leaders received. Views of the leadership of the Department of Education were much less favorable: 44 percent approved, 43 percent disapproved.\n\nMost positive of all were assessments of teachers themselves. Three of four Americans, 76 percent, approved of the teachers in their local district; just one in 10 disapproved.\n\nTeaching is among the most revered professions in the United States.\n\nA previous USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll this year, pegged to the Fourth of July, asked respondents to rate what was best about America. School teachers ranked third, trailing only nurses and “kindness to strangers,” and ahead of the Founding Fathers and police officers. (Way down the list: politicians, bankers, actors and journalists.)\n\nPoll:On the 4th, what symbolizes the best (and worst) of America? It depends whom you ask\n\nAmong those with kids under 18 years old, six in 10 parents said they would encourage their children to become teachers.\n\n“They have quite the job, trying to take care of everyone and being with our children for eight hours a day,” said Leslie Bailey, 33, an event manager from Ohio who has one child in preschool. “It’s a hard job.”\n\n“The attitudes of kids nowadays is especially terrible,” said Aaron Slepko, 37, of Norton, Ohio. “Teachers get the blunt end, and if they say anything, suddenly parents jump down their throats and they’re in trouble.”\n\nThe attrition rate for beginning teachers underscores the difficulties of the job. The nonprofit Learning Policy Institute estimates that 20 to 30 percent of teachers leave the field within their first five years.\n\nIn the new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll, just one-third agreed with the statement, “It is easy to become a teacher.” But nearly six in 10 agreed with this: “If I wanted to, I would be an excellent teacher.”\n\n'A BIG, POSITIVE IMPACT'\n\nThe effects of teaching can be considerable. Three of four Americans said they had a teacher when they were growing up who made “a big, positive impact” on their lives.\n\nCarol Kulman, the retiree from New York City, attributed her lifelong interest in politics to a high school teacher who assigned her students to write a report on two novels with different political perspectives. “I really learned a lot by writing that report,” Kulman recalled. Six decades later, she still remembered the grade she got: an A.\n\nGalluppi has never forgotten a middle school history teacher who spent his summers visiting historical places, collecting photographs and souvenirs to show his students. “He really didn’t stop teaching; he taught year-round, whether or not there were kids there,” he said.\n\nSue Brooks, 70, from Boise, Idaho, became a math teacher because of a math teacher who taught her. “He was very, very strict,” she said, in ways that wouldn’t be tolerated today. “If you didn’t know how to convert fractions or decimals to percent, he’d slap your hand with a ruler until you did. ...\n\n\"He just made sure that we learned, which is what we’re here to do ... not only the subject matter, but to get along with each other.\"\n\nContributing: Chrissie Thompson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2021/10/04/mlb-team-grades-rays-dazzle-mets-disappoint-scores/5986184001/", "title": "MLB regular season team grades: Rays dazzle, while Mets collapse", "text": "The 2021 Major League Baseball regular season wrapped up on Sunday with the league getting through a full 162-game schedule a year after the pandemic-shortened 2020.\n\nThere were some big surprises in 2021, like the San Francisco Giants winning 107 games to outlast the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}]}

He was 84.\n\nRepresentative Victoria Lord said the musician died at a Toronto hospital. His cause of death was not immediately available.\n\nConsidered one of the most renowned voices to emerge from Toronto’s Yorkville folk club scene in the 1960s, Lightfoot went on to record 20 studio albums and pen hundreds of songs, including “Carefree Highway” and “Sundown.”\n\nOnce called a “rare talent” by Bob Dylan, dozens of artists have covered his work, including Elvis Presley, Barbra Streisand, Harry Belafonte, Johnny Cash, Anne Murray, Jane’s Addiction and Sarah McLachlan.\n\nHow did Elvis Presley die?A look inside the rock legend's death and health.\n\nPoetry, parties and painful 'Sundown':5 takeaways from Gordon Lightfoot doc 'If You Could Read My Mind'\n\nMost of his songs are deeply autobiographical with lyrics that probe his own experiences in a frank manner and explore issues surrounding the Canadian national identity.\n\nHis 1975 song “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” chronicled the demise of a Great Lakes ore freighter, and 1966’s “Canadian Railroad Trilogy” depicted the construction of the railway.\n\n“I simply write the songs about where I am and where I’m from,” he once said. “I take situations and write poems about them.”\n\nOften described as a poetic storyteller, Lightfoot remained keenly aware of his cultural influence. It was a role he took very seriously.\n\n“I just like to stay there and be a part of the totem pole and look after the responsibilities I’ve acquired over the years,” he said in a 2001 interview.\n\nWhile Lightfoot’s parents recognized his musical talents early on, he didn’t set out to become a renowned balladeer.\n\nHe began singing in his church choir and dreamed of becoming a jazz musician. At age 13, the soprano won a talent contest at the Kiwanis Music Festival, held at Toronto’s Massey Hall.\n\n“I remember the thrill of being in front of the crowd,” Lightfoot said in a 2018 interview. “It was a stepping stone for me...”\n\nThe appeal of those early days stuck and in high school, his barbershop quartet, The Collegiate Four, won a CBC talent competition. He strummed his first guitar in 1956 and began to dabble in songwriting in the months that followed. Perhaps distracted by his taste for music, he flunked algebra the first time. After taking the class again, he graduated in 1957.\n\nBy then, Lightfoot had already penned his first serious composition — “The Hula Hoop Song,” inspired by the popular kids’ toy that was sweeping the culture. Attempts to sell the song went nowhere so at 18, he headed to the U.S. to study music for a year. The trip was funded in part by money saved from a job delivering linens to resorts around his hometown.\n\nLife in Hollywood wasn’t a good fit, however, and it wasn’t long before Lightfoot returned to Canada. He pledged to move to Toronto to pursue his musical ambitions, taking any job available, including a position at a bank before landing a gig as a square dancer on CBC’s “Country Hoedown.”\n\nHis first gig was at Fran’s Restaurant, a downtown family-owned diner that warmed to his folk sensibilities. It was there he met fellow musician Ronnie Hawkins.\n\nThe singer was living with a few buddies in a condemned building in Yorkville, then a bohemian area where future stars including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell would learn their trade at smoke-filled clubs.\n\nLightfoot made his popular radio debut with the single ”(Remember Me) I’m the One” in 1962, which led to a number of hit songs and partnerships with other local musicians. When he started playing the Mariposa Folk Festival in his hometown of Orillia, Ontario that same year, Lightfoot forged a relationship that made him the festival’s most loyal returning performer.\n\nBy 1964, he was garnering positive word-of-mouth around town and audiences were starting to gather in growing numbers. By the next year, Lightfoot’s song “I’m Not Sayin’” was a hit in Canada, which helped spread his name in the United States.\n\nA couple of covers by other artists didn’t hurt either. Marty Robbins’ 1965 recording of “Ribbon of Darkness” reached No. 1 on U.S. country charts, while Peter, Paul and Mary took Lightfoot’s composition, “For Lovin’ Me,” into the U.S. Top 30. The song, which Dylan once said he wished he’d recorded, has since been covered by hundreds of other musicians.\n\nThat summer, Lightfoot performed at the Newport Folk Festival, the same year Dylan rattled audiences when he shed his folkie persona by playing an electric guitar.\n\nAs the folk music boom came to an end in the late 1960s, Lightfoot was already making his transition to pop music with ease.\n\nIn 1971, he made his first appearance on the Billboard chart with “If You Could Read My Mind.\" It reached No. 5 and has since spawned scores of covers.\n\nLightfoot’s popularity peaked in the mid-1970s when both his single and album, “Sundown,” topped the Billboard charts, his first and only time doing so.\n\nDuring his career, Lightfoot collected 12 Juno Awards, including one in 1970 when it was called the Gold Leaf.\n\nIn 1986, he was inducted into the Canadian Recording Industry Hall of Fame, now the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. He received the Governor General’s award in 1997 and was ushered into the Canadian Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2001.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/12/13/upcoming-concerts-phoenix-billy-joel-post-malone-cardi-b-travis-scott/2268202002/", "title": "Upcoming concerts in Phoenix: Billy Joel, Post Malone, Tori Kelly", "text": "Billy Joel brings his hits to the ballpark in a season that also features a star-studded Pot of Gold Festival with Post Malone and Lil Wayne, the return of Justin Timberlake and Meek Mill.\n\nHere's a look at those and other highlights of the winter concert season.\n\n2/26: Muse\n\nAmong the more ambitious stadium-rock sensations to emerge from the shadow of Radiohead with two best-British-live-act trophies from the Brit Awards to show for it, they arrive in support of \"Simulation Theory.\" Phoenix is the third date on the tour.

No charges have been filed in this matter,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement to CNN at the time.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for both Pitt and Jolie for comment.\n\n“All parties have had this information for nearly six years and was used in previous legal proceedings. There is nothing new here and serves no purpose other than being a media stunt meant to inflict pain,” a source close to Pitt said of the report coming to light now.\n\nAccording to the FBI report, Jolie told investigators that two of their children (whose names are not evident in the redacted report, but were noted to be minors at the time) “were outside the door crying and asked ‘Are you ok Mommy?’”\n\nPitt allegedly yelled in response, “‘No, mommy’s not ok. She’s ruining this family. She’s crazy,’” the report states.\n\nAccording to Jolie, that prompted one of their children to respond “‘It’s not her, it’s you, you p***k,’” which she said enraged Pitt and she alleged that she saw him run toward one of the children “like he was going to attack,” at which point she said she got Pitt into a choke hold that he tried to break by throwing himself back, pushing her into the chairs behind them, it says in the report.\n\nJolie alleged in the report that she suffered injuries to her back and elbow as a result and shared a photo of the injury to her elbow with the FBI.\n\nBlack and white photocopies of the photos are included in the report, as well as handwritten pages provided by Jolie, purportedly from her children, containing descriptions of the alleged incident. The handwritten pages are substantially redacted.\n\nJolie also said in the report that Pitt continued to drink during the two-legged trip, later pouring beer on her. After they arrived in Los Angeles, the pair had a physical altercation and she said Pitt prevented her and the children from leaving the plane for 20 minutes.\n\nIn addition to her back and elbow, the report states Jolie said she also suffered “a rug burn type wound” on her left hand.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/trump-force-one-west-palm-beach/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump's Boeing 757 rehabbed and back in West Palm ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhether Donald Trump is prepared to take-off on another bid for the presidency remains up in the air, but his fabled Boeing 757 is definitely getting off the ground.\n\nAccording to flight data studied and analyzed by CNN and aviation experts consulted by CNN, Trump’s jet has spent several hours over the last week running pattern flights above a small airport in Lake Charles, Louisiana, likely testing various updated components before heading to the Palm Beach International Airport, where it arrived Wednesday evening. Trump has previously indicated that the plane would be in Louisiana for repairs.\n\nThe plane’s arrival in West Palm Beach comes less than three weeks before the 2022 midterm elections and with the political world on constant watch for Trump to announce another run for the White House. While Trump’s world has felt under siege with multiple investigations and legal actions open against him, the return of so-called “Trump Force One” to its home base could provide a jolt to Trump’s fans.\n\nThe arrival of the plane at the airport that’s just 15 minutes from Mar-a-Lago is a significant indicator that not only is it airworthy – the 31-year-old jumbo jet had been idle for the four years of Trump’s presidency and many months afterward – it may be getting prepped to assume its former life as Trump’s biggest campaign prop.\n\nCNN has reached out to a representative for Donald Trump for comment on the plane’s activity and has not yet received a response. The plane appeared to be in use Saturday as Trump traveled to Texas for a rally, according to a tweet from Trump aide Dan Scavino Jr.\n\nTrump’s jet has twice in recent days made a series of short flight loops at varying altitudes, taking off and landing at Chennault International Airport in Louisiana. Some of the flights lasted less than 10 minutes, according to the data, and did not go beyond altitudes of 3,000 feet. Others were longer, 20 to 30 minutes, at altitudes ranging from 9,000 to 23,000 feet.\n\n“It is common after a plane has had upgrades – or other new equipment or general avionic tweaks – for pilots to make a series of test flights to ensure safety and function,” said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The series of passes at different altitudes, such as the ones completed in Louisiana, are indicative of standard checks.”\n\nThat the plane, which Trump purchased in 2010 from the late Microsoft founder Paul Allen, has been improved to the point of taking flight is a recent development. In March 2021, CNN was first to report Trump’s once omnipresent 757 was sitting idle on a tarmac at a small New York state airport with one engine shrink-wrapped, mechanically grounded. It remained just north of New York City at Stewart Airport in New Windsor, New York, for several more months before it was flown to Louisiana on November 1, 2021, according to flight tracker information obtained by CNN.\n\nTrump's airplane sits at the edge of a runway in need of repairs on March 22, 2021, at Stewart Airport outside Newburgh, New York. Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThat flight was presumably made with an engine worthy enough for the plane to obtain a Special Flight Permit – or “Ferry Permit” – from the FAA, multiple experts told CNN. The permits allow registered planes to be approved for flight. According to FAA data, a reason for granting a ferry permit is for an aircraft to fly to a location where “repairs, alterations, or maintenance are to be performed, or to a point of salvage.”\n\nCNN has requested a confirmation of the ferry permit issued for Trump’s plane, which is owned by DJT Operations LLC, from the FAA and has not yet received the information.\n\nA standard passenger Boeing 757-200 series has about 228 seats. Trump’s custom 757 features 43 seats – along with a main bedroom, guest suite, dining room, VIP area and custom galley. Trump has mainly flown to-and-from various destinations on his much smaller, eight-seater, 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X. That plane does have a small Trump-family crest painted on the fuselage but lacks the giant Trump name on its outside.\n\nAccording to flight records, when Trump is not on the Citation, he typically flies on chartered planes belonging to other people.\n\nYet in July of this year, the 757, a regular backdrop for Trump’s campaign appearances and rallies during the run-up to the 2016 election, was featured in a slick video posted by Eric Trump to social media. That video featured the 757 getting a new paint job at a hangar in Louisiana.\n\n“She’s back,” he wrote.\n\nIn the caption of Eric Trump’s Instagram post of the video, the former President was quoted teasing the rebirth of his beloved private plane, saying the sparkly new exterior tune-up done so “Trump Force One” – the plane’s nickname – could be “back to the skies in the Fall of 2022, or maybe sooner.”\n\nThe reveal of the new paint job showed a fresh, gold “TRUMP” on the fuselage, and a new addition of an American flag on the tail. The paint job was completed in 26 days, according to Tyson Grenzebach, of Landlocked Aviation, who in a July interview with Louisiana Radio Network said his company did full “scuff, sand and paint” on Trump’s plane.\n\nThough the interior, exterior and – as of Wednesday – the sky worthiness of Trump’s 757 appears to be updated, according to experts who spoke to CNN, the purpose of getting the plane ready for some sort of grand reveal near the midterms or a campaign announcement has yet to be confirmed by the former president.\n\nFor Trump, the plane is one of his prized possessions. He oversaw the hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars’ worth of renovations done to his prized possession shortly after he took ownership; any metal in the plane’s interior – lights, seat buckles, handles, latches, knobs – was plated in 24-karat gold.\n\nIn March of last year, following CNN’s story about the 757, Trump did release a statement confirming his plane was in “storage” and getting repairs.\n\n“When completed, it will be better than ever, and again used at upcoming rallies!” wrote Trump wrote at the time.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/covid-variants-concern-new-year/index.html", "title": "Coronavirus: 2022 ends with looming risk of a new variant, public ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the world enters a new year, many public health and infectious disease experts predict that monitoring for new coronavirus variants will be an increasingly important part of Covid-19 mitigation efforts – and some are turning their attention to a surge in cases in China.\n\nSubvariants of the Omicron coronavirus variant continue to circulate globally, and “we’re seeing Omicron do what viruses do, which is it picks up mutations along the way that helps it evade a little bit of immunity that’s induced by previous infection or vaccination,” said Andrew Pekosz, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\n“We haven’t seen any major jumps in terms of Omicron evolution in some time,” he said. But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/world/flights-reroute-around-russia-carbon-cost-climate/index.html", "title": "Flights are taking huge 'detours' to avoid Russian air space. Here's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSince Russia closed its airspace to airlines from dozens of countries at the end of February – in response to sanctions levied for its invasion of Ukraine – about 400 flights per month that had previously been routed over the country are being forced to take a wider berth, according to Flightradar24.\n\nIn lieu of using Russian airspace, some flights from Europe to Asia are flying south of the country or, in some cases, taking a painfully long reroute over the Arctic. And Russia is huge; it’s the largest country on the planet – larger than the continent of Antarctica.\n\nThe new routes are leading to more time in the air for passengers and crew, more miles flown and more fuel burned – which means more planet-warming emissions.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight JL43 from Tokyo to London, for instance, uses a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft that burns roughly 2,300 gallons of fuel per hour. The rerouted JL43 flight – which now heads east over the North Pacific, Alaska, Canada and Greenland – added 2.4 hours of flight time and likely burned around 5,600 gallons more fuel, a 20% increase.\n\nThat means Flight JL43 could be emitting an additional 54,000 kilograms, or 60 tons, of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to calculations by Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading, for CNN. That’s the same amount of carbon dioxide as the average car driving 137,000 miles, or nearly six times around the planet.\n\nWilliams said the exact fuel burn rate depends on the weight of the aircraft, the altitude and airspeed, and some of those variables are unknown. These calculations also do not factor in the warming effect of other greenhouse gas emissions or the flights’ condensation trails.\n\n“Naturally, a lot of people when thinking about aviation and climate, they focus on the CO2 emitted,” Williams told CNN. “But, actually, it’s much worse than that. CO2 is actually just the tip of the iceberg. The extra flight time is causing a lot more warming than the mileages I gave you because they only take into account the CO2, not the other non-CO2 effects.”\n\nDan Rutherford, director of the International Council on Clean Transportation’s aviation and marine programs, told CNN that Williams’ calculations “look reasonable.”\n\n“If anything, he is underestimating the likely impact because, at the margin, long-haul flights become even more fuel intensive with extra distance because they ‘burn fuel to carry fuel,’ in industry parlance,” Rutherford said.\n\nIn other words, it’s a vicious, fuel-guzzling loop: It takes more fuel to carry the weight of more fuel.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24, the aircraft tracking service, there are a limited number of flights – mostly Finnair flights – taking the polar route around Russia. Others are taking a southern route.\n\nLufthansa Flight LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo, for example, has added nearly an hour to its flight time. The Airbus A340 aircraft typically burns around 2,000 gallons of fuel an hour, which could mean the extra flight time burned another 1,428 gallons of fuel.\n\nThat’s an additional 13,710 kilograms of planet-warming emissions – the same amount released by an average car driving 34,000 miles, or nearly twice around the world.\n\nRutherford estimated that if Russian airspace remains closed for much longer, the global aviation carbon inventory may increase by up to 1%.\n\nThat seems very low, but air travel is a significant contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for more than 2% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions as of 2018, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. The institute notes that if the aviation industry were its own country, it would rank No. 6 in carbon emissions.\n\n“[However], I consider that a marginal impact that governments shouldn’t consider when setting policy regarding the Ukrainian invasion,” Rutherford told CNN. “It’s a small price to pay to defend global democracy and the international rule of law, in my personal opinion.”\n\nFlying can make up a huge portion of a person’s carbon footprint. For instance, a one-way intercontinental flight between Hong Kong and San Francisco emits more carbon dioxide than the average British person’s activities – or that of 10 people living in Ghana – over the course of a year, according to a 2020 analysis published in the journal Nature. “Fly less” is often the first line of expert advice for people looking to reduce their climate impact.\n\nBut with the aviation industry struggling to decarbonize, Williams said he expects emissions from aviation to only increase over time.\n\n“Aviation is finding it really difficult to decarbonize than the rest of the economy,” he said. “Because the plane needs so much energy to generate the thrust, it’s really problematic to move away from fossil fuels. So aviation is a small part of the jigsaw currently, but in the coming decades, it will grow as a fraction of global emissions.”\n\nBut right now, the extra emissions are unavoidable, Williams said. There are no other options than taking the long way around Russia.\n\nAirlines can invest in new, more efficient aircrafts and shift to sustainable aviation fuels, Rutherford said, but those are long-term solutions. Short-term strategies are limited.\n\n“The extra fuel use and emissions, and also extra fuel cost due to higher oil prices generally, are basically inescapable for airlines,” Rutherford said. “In addition to paying more, they can reduce payload – passengers or carriage – at the cost of some revenue, or they can cancel the flight.”\n\nIn February, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the “current events” showed the world was too reliant on fossil fuels, calling them “a dead end.” A recent UN climate report shows that unless Earth’s warming is dramatically slowed, billions of people and other species may no longer be able to adapt to irreversible changes brought by fossil fuel emissions.\n\nRutherford said he expects “renewed interest in developing alternative fuels in shipping and aviation, to distance those industries from Russian energy exports.”\n\n“This particular war is causing a wide rethink about getting off of fossil fuels,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/business/flight-cancellations-sunday-monday/index.html", "title": "At least 800 more flights canceled Monday after a chaotic travel ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAt least 800 flights were canceled across the United States on Monday afternoon, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. This follows another chaotic travel weekend with more than 1,500 domestic flights canceled Saturday and Sunday.\n\nDelta alone canceled at least 224 flights Monday, or 7% of its operations, while United canceled 128 flights and American Airlines (AAL) nixed 67. CNN has reached out to the three airlines for comment on the flight cancellations.\n\n“Delta teams continue to safely manage through compounding factors affecting our operation this weekend, including higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some of our work groups, weather, and air traffic control constraints,” a Delta Air Lines spokesperson said Sunday. “Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for any disruption to their travel plans.”\n\nIt’s going to be a summer of travel hell, experts warn. Though airlines received $54 billion in federal assistance during Covid’s peak to avoid involuntary layoffs, they now have fewer employees than before the pandemic — especially pilots — after offering buyouts and early retirement packages to trim staff and save money. As a result, operations can quickly fall apart when there’s bad weather, understaffed air traffic control centers or sick staff.\n\nAtlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and the New York City area’s Newark Liberty International were most impacted by Monday’s cancellations, with Newark alone accounting for more than 100 canceled flights.\n\nUnited — which canceled 56 flights on Saturday and 70 flights Sunday — had said last Thursday it would cut 12% of its daily domestic flights from its busy Newark hub.

That's more than 40 a day, tying the previous year's record.\n\nThe strikes have been blamed in more than 106 civilian deaths worldwide over the past two decades, according to British and Canadian researchers. They cause about $1.2 billion a year in damage.\n\nWhy so many collisions? Analysts cite several factors: an increase in flights; changing migratory patterns; bigger, faster, quieter turbofan-powered aircraft, which give birds less time to get out of the way.\n\nOne of the biggest factors might be better reporting. The FAA has worked to improve the voluntary reporting system since Sullenberger guided U.S. Airways Flight 1549 – and all of its 155 passengers – to safety after a flock of geese took out both engines in 2009.\n\nMore:‘Miracle on the Hudson’ flight survivors mark decade of gratitude\n\n\"That number has certainly been steadily increasing ever since the 'Miracle on the Hudson,' \" says Chris Oswald, vice president of the Airports Council International-North America. \"A lot of that – and I can only say a lot because it's hard to know – has to do with outreach activities.\"\n\nHe says the industry is concerned that a change in bird populations – and especially a boom in larger species – could pose a continued danger to aircraft.\n\nBiologists and aviation safety officials are engaged in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game in an effort to shoo, move or kill birds in the nation's flight paths.\n\nFAA reports show how disruptive – and potentially dangerous – bird strikes can be:\n\n► On Dec. 22, a Republic Airlines flight to Minneapolis hit what the pilot said looked like a hawk while taking off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. Five engine blades were damaged, causing the plane to vibrate and the pilot to make an emergency landing. Blood was found in the engine, but the bird's remains were never found.\n\n► The Monday after Thanksgiving, a JetBlue flight in Portland, Oregon, hit a Canada goose just after liftoff. Crew and passengers felt the impact and heard a loud thud, but the pilot thought it was a blown tire. After circling the airport and burning fuel for 30 minutes, the crew saw the tires were intact but the flaps were damaged. They landed and discovered a 6- to 8-inch hole in the right flap and a 12-inch dent in the engine.\n\n► The previous day, airport operations crew in San Francisco heard a loud boom just before an EVA Air flight to Taiwan reported an engine failure. The Boeing 777 dumped more than 36,000 gallons of fuel and made an emergency landing. The suspect was a blue heron; the airline sent bird remains to the Smithsonian Institution for testing.\n\nThe Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab is a sort of \"CSI for birds.\" It analyzes bird remains known as \"snarge\" – military slang for \"snot garbage\" – through feathers and DNA testing.\n\nThose results can tell an important story.\n\nIn Kansas City, for example, they show that most bird strikes involve species such as swallows and meadowlarks – birds that feed on Japanese beetles, which have been a growing infestation in Kansas City in recent years.\n\nAs a percentage of flights, no airport had more bird strikes last year than Kansas City International Airport, where the number has doubled since 2016. Most strikes occurred during the summer months, when the beetles abound.\n\nAdding to the jeopardy: The airport built on farmland, and it sits along the Mississippi flyway, a major migratory corridor.\n\n\"KCI takes all wildlife management very seriously, especially in light of the unique challenges presented by our location and the amount of land we manage,\" operations manager Bob Johnson said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"Bird strikes are of particular concern, and that is why we have adopted the 100 percent reporting policy that is above and beyond what is required by the FAA.\"\n\nJohnson said the airport has worked to reduce bird habitats around the airport by substituting cattle grazing for grain crops, reducing the pooling of rainwater, and cutting down 50 acres of trees that housed nests.\n\nTravis DeVault works as a biologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. \"Really, the bedrock of wildlife management at airports is habitat management,\" he says. \"And that means eliminating three things: food, water and cover.\"\n\nAirports harass birds with noisemakers or fake predators, but birds can get acclimated to those attempts and return once they learn the harassment isn't a threat.\n\nIn extreme cases, airports cull the population by shooting the birds.\n\nDeVault and others have been working on other measures – especially those that would reduce the growing number of bird strikes miles away from airports.\n\nBy analyzing the carcasses of 92 birds hit by airplanes at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, DeVault and other scientists were able to determine that most of them were flying away from the plane – but not fast enough.\n\nDeVault wants to give them an earlier warning, using aircraft lights. He's conducting tests to determine the bandwidths and flicker rates that will be visible to the broadest range of birds.\n\n\"We’re trying to give the birds a little more time to get our of the way, and we're trying to do that with aircraft lighting,\" he says. \"But it has to be tuned to the visual capability of birds.\"\n\nOther researchers analyze bird flight patterns and avian radar to give air traffic controllers and pilots more information about where the birds are in real time.\n\nBird strikes are about 98 percent of wildlife strikes reported to federal officials, but the database includes hundreds of contacts with other animals, usually at smaller airports.\n\nThe FAA received 40 reports last year of planes hitting coyotes, 35 involving turtles or tortoises and 24 deer.\n\nIn Florida, it's not unheard of for a plane on the runway to encounter an alligator.\n\nProblems are usually solved with better fencing, but birds can't be fenced out and are likely to be a problem as long as airplanes share the skies with them.\n\nAfter all, the first-ever reported bird strike came from Orville Wright himself. He hit a red-winged blackbird over a cornfield outside Dayton, Ohio, in 1905.\n\n\"It’s not something you can build out of,\" Oswald says. \"It's never going away entirely.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/business/last-boeing-747/index.html", "title": "The very last 747 jumbo jet just rolled off Boeing's assembly line ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter 53 years and more than 1,570 planes, the last Boeing 747 rolled off the assembly line in Washington state Tuesday evening, on its way to serve as a cargo plane.\n\nThe once-groundbreaking jumbo jet, with the distinctive second-floor bulge, is perhaps the most notable and popular plane Boeing has ever built. It was even big enough to be used to ferry the Space Shuttle from landing strips in California to its launch site in Florida. And it is set to launch a new type of spacecraft by Virgin Orbit as soon as next week, after carrying it aloft under its wing.\n\nThe 747 was once the choice of the rich and glamorous, and even royalty. Many movies, including the 1973 James Bond classic “Live and Let Die” featured the plane, or sets made to look like the first class lounge on its upper level. The 747 still serves as Air Force One, as it has since 1990. Two already-assembled planes are undergoing work right now to be transformed into the next generation of the presidential jet. Those planes won’t be delivered for at least four years due to delays.\n\nThe last Boeing 747 left the company's widebody factory in Everett, Washington, Tuesday night. It is due to be delivered to Atlas Air for use as a freighter early next year. Paul Weatherman/Boeing\n\nOther than that use, the 747’s days as a passenger plane are now almost completely behind it. Airlines have moved away from planes with four fuel-guzzling engines like the 747. Rival Airbus (EADSF) dropped its own two-level jumbo jet, the A380, in 2019.\n\nBoeing had signaled in 2020 that it would stop building the 747, even in its freighter form, as customers bought either the more fuel-efficient 777 freighter or saved money by reconditioning former 747 passenger jets as freighters. It has not yet announced plans for the factory in Everett, Washington, where it has been building the 747, but it does expect to keep it open. In order to build the massive plane the facility is 200 million cubic feet, which Boeing says makes it the world’s largest building by volume.\n\nThe passenger versions of the plane could carry between 400 to 500 passengers, at its maximum about twice as many passengers as one of Boeing’s current widebody jets, the 787-8 Dreamliner. But Boeing hasn’t built a passenger version of the 747 since it delivered the last one to Korean Airlines in 2017. This last 747 will go to Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW), which will operate the plane for Swiss logistics company Kuehne+Nagel. Tuesday’s final plane will be flown to another Boeing facility shop for painting and other final details, before being delivered to Atlas early next year.\n\nToday there are only 44 passenger versions of the 747 still in service, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. More than half of those — 25 — are flown by Lufthansa.\n\nThat total is down from more than 130 in service as passenger jets at the end of 2019, just before the pandemic crippled demand for air travel, especially on international routes on which the 747 and other widebody jets were primarily used. Most of those passenger versions of the jets were grounded during the early months of the pandemic and never returned to service.\n\nBut there are still 314 747 freighters in use, according to Cirium, many of which were initially used as passenger jets before being renovated into freighters.\n\n“The 747-8 is an incredibly capable aircraft, with capacity that is unmatched by any other freighter in production,” said UPS in 2020, when Boeing signaled it would soon stop building the jet. “With a maximum payload of 307,000 lbs., we use them on long, high-volume routes, connecting Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East.”\n\nThe current version of the 747 is 250 feet and 2 inches long, the longest commercial plane now in service, or about twice the length of the Wright Brothers’ first flight. It has a wingspan of 224 feet and 5 inches.\n\nBoeing delivered the first 747 passenger jets in December 1969 to two airlines that no longer exist — TWA and Pan Am. Delta Air Lines (DAL) was the last US airline to fly a passenger version of the plane, also in 2017. That was the last year the final US 747 passenger flights — by both Delta and United (UAL) — drew large crowds of the plane’s fans, a testament to its enduring popularity.\n\n– CNN’s Jackie Wattles contributed to this report\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated the wrong Virgin company using the 747 to launch rockets into outer space.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}]}

Mordaunt was effectively sidelined from the great offices of state by former prime minister Liz Truss after losing to her in the race to become Tory leader.\n\nMany commented in awe at the stamina of Mordaunt, 50, as she carried the heavy sword upright in front of her for a significant period of time. “I’ve been doing some press-ups to train for that,” she told Times Radio . “We get to practise with some replicas which are weighted,” she added, saying that her military training had helped.\n\nThe former defence secretary and Conservative Party leadership candidate carried the “sword of state”, a 17th-century four-foot ceremonial weapon weighing eight pounds, according to Politico . She then exchanged it for the “sword of offering”, decorated with diamonds, emeralds and rubies.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, became an unexpected star of the coronation after her performance as Lord President of the Council, the first woman ever to hold the role.\n\nAny national event with such pomp and ceremony will undoubtedly mean some mixed opinions. The Week takes a look at a few of the most cited highlights and lowlights over the weekend.\n\nMore than 20 million people in the UK tuned in to watch the ceremony on TV, according to CNN , and tens of thousands braved the rain to stand outside and see the newly crowned King appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III took place to both fanfare and controversy on Saturday, battling high expectations and appalling weather to please the maximum number of subjects.\n\nThe Met confirmed that 52 of the arrests “related to concerns people were going to disrupt the event, and arrests included to prevent a breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance”.\n\nThe government had “pushed through new powers to prevent protests just days before the coronation”, added the Financial Times. The Public Order Act makes “certain types of disruptive protest a criminal offence” and gives police “the right to intervene to stop protests before they happen”, the paper added.\n\nSix members of the anti-monarchy group Republic were arrested. “There is no longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK,” its chief executive Graham Smith tweeted.\n\n“We regret that those six people arrested were unable to join the wider group of protesters in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere on the procession route,” the Met said last night. Bail for the six has since been cancelled and no further action will be taken.\n\nAmong those arrested were three volunteers from Westminster Council’s safety team, who were handing out rape alarms to women. Mic Wright, a journalist who spoke with the volunteers, wrote on Twitter: “The Met arrested members of the City of Westminster’s Night Safety team. They are volunteers. They were pulled last night at 2am and have been held for 14 hours. One of them came out of the station in tears. Police didn’t apologise.”\n\nThe Met said there was intelligence that some groups had planned to disrupt the procession with rape alarms. The three volunteers have since been given police bail.\n\nHighlight: music\n\nThe coronation was “a magnificent celebration of choral, orchestral and liturgical music-making”, said Classic FM.\n\nThe line-up featured pieces by Handel, Bach, Holst, Vaughan Williams and William Byrd, among others, new musical compositions based on the King’s favourite hymn, solo performances from Pretty Yende and Roderick Williams, and a coronation anthem written by Andrew Lloyd Webber: “Make a Joyful Noise”.\n\nIn a “historic first”, the entire coronation was recorded and released as an album on Saturday.\n\n“Music was almost constantly present,” said The Guardian, “treated as peripheral until it was needed to deliver on the grandest scale.”\n\nLowlight: weather\n\n“The crowning of Charles III in relentless rain followed a long tradition of wretched weather on coronation days that goes back centuries,” said The Times.\n\nThe weather was so bad that the planned military flypast over Buckingham Palace had to be scaled back.\n\nCharles “remained upbeat about the weather”, said the Daily Mirror. “I hope you don’t all get soaked,” he had reportedly told campers on The Mall on Friday. “Rain is a blessing… except for your camera!”\n\n“Royalty. Regalia. Rain. It’s what Britain does best,” said The Daily Telegraph. The London crowds “flatly refused to let the weather dampen the celebratory mood”, it said, “with good humour, stoicism, and a phalanx of sturdy umbrellas”.\n\nHighlight: Prince Louis’ facial expressions\n\n“Prince Louis may be known for his reputation of show stealing balcony antics at royal events,” said the Daily Mail, “and today was no different for the little royal.”\n\nThe third child of the Prince and Princess of Wales “couldn’t contain his excitement at Buckingham Palace as he gestured into the crowd”.\n\nThe five-year-old joined a number of other working royals on the balcony, with an enthusiastic double “jazz hand” wave. He was also filmed yawning during the ceremony.\n\n“What a cheeky little chap Prince Louis is, made me chuckle,” one spectator tweeted.\n\nLowlight: Mistimed carriage arrivals\n\nThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach, carrying King Charles and Queen Camilla, arrived at Westminster Abbey five minutes early. The two then had to wait in the carriage while the coach carrying the Prince and Princess of Wales caught up.\n\nThe king was seen on camera speaking to Camilla, with a seemingly disgruntled expression.

The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/17/coronavirus-takes-toll-las-cruces-all-you-need-know/5069222002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Southern New Mexico: What you need to know about ...", "text": "The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is upending all of our lives.

Laliotis stated that the hospital is making every effort \"to avoid inciting unnecessary panic or anxiety among our clients and families, and we are taking every measure to protect them – along with our employees – during this dynamic situation.\" Hospital administrators are closely monitoring information provided by key government, regulatory and local entities.\n\nMVH urges its community to follow the guidance: If individuals develop a fever or cough or have difficulty breathing, or have had close contact with someone who has had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test result, please seek medical attention by calling your provider’s office. For information regarding COVID-19, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.\n\nIn the interest of protecting the health and safety of the hospital's patients, staff and community, the following actions have been implemented at MVH.\n\nServices and Programs\n\nThe facility remains fully operational and serving the needs of its community. It is taking proactive steps to keep patients and team members safe, including screening all individuals upon entering the facility.\n\nFor those in need of non-emergency behavioral healthcare, contact MVH rather than the local Emergency Department.\n\nMVH is actively monitoring and responding to all recommendations made by the CDC and local regulatory and health authorities.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the likelihood of community spread, all in-person visitation has been suspended (with limited, critical exceptions). MVH strongly encourages the use of electronic methods to stay connected with loved ones — including telemedicine, Zoom and extended phone time.\n\nMVH has implemented additional training for all employees on handwashing and hand sanitization, and strict employee and client compliance with washing/sanitizing hands thoroughly and often.\n\nThe hospital has increased the frequency of the required cleaning and sanitization of its facility, including intake rooms, surfaces and common areas.\n\nThe facility’s community education programs may be canceled/postponed; it asks the community to follow Mesilla Valley Hospital on Facebook for updates.\n\n\"We thank our community for everyone’s cooperation and for being an advocate for the health of your loved ones and all patients in our care,\" Laliotis stated in the written release.\n\n2:55 PM: Class of 2020 senior photos\n\nThe Class of 2020 is missing out some important milestones, including prom and graduation ceremonies in May.

The federal government has also announced it will be making direct payments to taxpayers as part of its relief efforts.\n\nCriminals target taxpayers as well as tax preparers because of the opportunity that presents to steal information on multiple taxpayers all at once, the department stated.\n\nPotential targets may receive phone calls or emails with messaging such as “in order to receive your/your client’s stimulus payment via direct deposit, we need you to confirm the banking information,” according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, most people will not need to take any action to receive their stimulus payments, as the payments will be distributed automatically. The IRS will not call, text or email people to verify their banking information for stimulus payments.\n\nTaxpayers and preparers should always beware of phishing scams by email and unsolicited phone calls seeking social security numbers or credit card and banking information\n\nAnyone unsure about an inquiry from the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department may call 1-866-285-2996 and ask for confirmation on the status of their return.

Individuals may coerce victims into providing sexually explicit images or videos of themselves, often in compliance with offenders’ threats to post the images publicly or send the images to victims’ friends and family.\n\nOther offenders may make casual contact with children online, gain their trust, and introduce sexual conversation that increases in egregiousness over time. Ultimately this activity may result in maintaining an online relationship that includes sexual conversation and the exchange of illicit images, to eventually physically meeting the child in-person.\n\nIn order for the victimization to stop, children typically have to come forward to someone they trust — typically a parent, teacher, caregiver or law enforcement, the agency stated. The embarrassment of being enticed and/or coerced to engage in unwanted behavior is what often prevents children from coming forward. Offenders may have hundreds of victims around the world, so coming forward to help law enforcement identify offenders may prevent countless other incidents of sexual exploitation.\n\nAbuse can occur offline through direct contact with another individual. During these uncertain conditions, where time with other adults and caregivers has increased immensely, parents/guardians should communicate with their children about appropriate contact with adults and watch for any changes in behavior, including an increase in nightmares, withdrawn behavior, angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, not wanting to be left alone with an individual, and sexual knowledge.\n\nParents and guardians are urged to take the following measures to help educate and prevent children from becoming victims of child predators and sexual exploitation during this time of national emergency:\n\nDiscuss Internet safety with children of all ages when they engage in online activity.\n\nReview and approve games and apps before they are downloaded.\n\nMake sure privacy settings are set to the strictest level possible for online gaming systems and electronic devices.\n\nMonitor your children’s use of the Internet; keep electronic devices in an open, common room of the house.\n\nCheck your children’s profiles and what they post online.\n\nExplain to your children that images posted online will be permanently on the Internet.\n\nMake sure children know that anyone who asks a child to engage in sexually explicit activity online should be reported to a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult and law enforcement.\n\nCrime:Sunland Park mother charged after 4 children, including newborn, test positive for drugs\n\nMore information about the FBI’s guidance on protecting children from sexual exploitation is available at https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/protecting-your-kids.\n\n1:40 PM: MountainView Regional Medical Center tightens restrictions on visitors\n\nMountainView Regional Medical Center on Tuesday announced tighter restrictions on all visitors in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in New Mexico, and continuing efforts to slow community spread of the disease.\n\nBeginning Wednesday morning, the private hospital said it will bar all visitors, vendors and contractors with a few, specific exceptions.

But the majority of questions that get emailed, phoned and texted to us (day and night) are not technical questions about social distancing (“Are we supposed to stay 6 feet or 6 meters apart?”) but rather, “Should I get tested?” and “Where can I get tested?”\n\n-----\n\n4:31 PM: SBA disaster assistance now available to all New Mexico small businesses economically impacted by COVID-19 outbreak\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. - The U.S. Small Business Administration is offering low-interest federal disaster loans for working capital to all New Mexico small businesses suffering substantial economic injury as a result of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza announced Saturday.\n\nSBA disaster assistance is now available to all counties within the state of New Mexico and the following neighboring counties:\n\nNeighboring Arizona counties: Apache, Cochise and Greenlee;\n\nNeighboring Colorado counties: Archuleta, Baca, Conejos, Costilla, La Plata, Las Animas and Montezuma;\n\nNeighboring Oklahoma county: Cimarron;\n\nNeighboring Texas counties: Andrews, Bailey, Cochran, Culberson, Dallam, Deaf Smith, El Paso, Gaines, Hartley, Hudspeth, Loving, Oldham, Parmer, Reeves, Winkler and Yoakum;\n\nNeighboring Utah county: San Juan.\n\nBusiness:Small Business Administration provides resources to military and veterans\n\n“SBA is strongly committed to providing the most effective and customer-focused response possible to assist New Mexico small businesses with federal disaster loans.

Base leadership continues to collaborate with city, county and state officials to actively monitor the situation.\n\nColonel Joseph Campo’s declaration of the public health emergency elevates the safety and security measures to help protect the base populace and surrounding community. A number of precautionary measures have already been in place including minimal staffing, social distancing, and closing or limiting services at certain businesses. The base has also enhanced its childcare screening to protect childcare providers and children.\n\nEffective Friday, March 20, access to the base is limited to Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard personnel, and their dependents. Additionally, contractor and civilian personnel executing or supporting their units’ mission and all residents of Holloman AFB will be permitted access.\n\nRetired personnel will be permitted on base, but only to access the medical clinic. Current visitor passes will be honored, but no new passes will be issued. New Family Camp mobile lodging residents are restricted to Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard personnel.\n\nBase officials say these are temporary measures to ensure Holloman’s mission will continue by protecting the health of Holloman’s military members, civilians, contractors, and their families.\n\n-----\n\nMilitary:Airman runs own marathon to honor Bataan Memorial Death March\n\n3:27 PM: Comcast suspends data restrictions, disconnections and late fees\n\nComcast on Saturday announced several changes in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These include a suspension of service disconnections and late fees until further notice, as well as the opening of all public WiFi hotspots — which will become free for everyone.\n\nThe company has increased speeds for its low-income Internet Essentials customers, and new customers who apply by April 30 will receive two months of free service with no obligation to continue the service after that.\n\nComcast will also eliminate data limits for the next 60 days, the company announced. X1 users can access educational content on the service. Just say “education” into the voice remote. The latest COVID-19 news can be accessed by speaking “Coronavirus” into the voice remote.\n\n-----\n\n3:17 PM: Stay calm, reassuring when talking to kids about COVID-19, NMSU professor suggests\n\nParents are faced with the difficult task of talking to their children about the COVID-19 pandemic, but should remain calm and reassuring in these uncertain times, said Lisa Peterson, a New Mexico State University assistant professor and director of the School Psychology Doctoral Program in", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/22/goats-got-milk-winnebago-tribe-new-mexico-quake-news-around-states/117628544/", "title": "Goats got milk, Winnebago Tribe, New Mexico quake : News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMaxwell Air Force Base:The 908th Airlift Wing was among the units across the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command that was able to resume Physical Fitness Assessment testing for its members. Over the Unit Training Assembly weekend of July 10-11, more than 100 Reserve Citizen Airmen from the 908th participated in the testing in Montgomery, Ala., which provided wing leadership with important data. Healthy and fit airmen are better equipped to mitigate the stresses of living and working in the austere environments often encountered at deployed locations. However, social distancing protocols limited the options airmen had to participate in physical training. Combined with postponed testing, some airmen experienced a lack in the motivation to stay fit because they couldn’t participate in their preferred activity or sport. Now that restrictions have been lifted and testing has resumed, some airmen have regained the incentive to maintain an exercise regimen and healthier lifestyle.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state-run ferry system is proposing a winter schedule that suggests limited service for some southeast Alaskan communities and improved service for Kodiak Island and some parts of south-central Alaska. State transportation department spokesperson Andy Mills told CoastAlaska the draft schedule reflects the best the state can do given available funding and maintenance needs within the fleet. Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed about $8.5 million for vessel operations, which his budget office said would “align service with historical demand, while providing 18 months of funding to align the system’s budget with the calendar year.” The move to provide funding for operations for 18 months rather than the traditional 12 months was intended in part to provide more stability in scheduling. The draft, which the transportation department is taking public comment on, covers operations between October and April and calls for up to five ships operating at any one time. One of those, however, is a ferry that shuttles between Ketchikan and nearby Metlakatla.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State wildlife officials and conservationists are offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects in the recent poaching of a desert bighorn sheep at Gillespie Dam southwest of Phoenix. The illegal harvest of the ram occurred the evening of July 10 south of Buckeye, the Arizona Game and Fish Department said. Investigators said a group of five Asian males seen leaving the scene at approximately 8:30 p.m. in a gray sedan and a black sport utility vehicle might have been involved. Anyone with information can call Operation Game Thief hotline at (800) 352-0700 regarding case #21-002114. Tipsters might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 for information that leads to an arrest in this case. The Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society is offering an additional reward of $1,000 for information that leads to a conviction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Public health researchers called the rapid rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas a “raging forest fire,” and the state’s top health official warned that he expects significant outbreaks in schools. The model by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases a day in children under age 17. Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated. Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a “surge on top of this surge” when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated. Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Six more California counties are urging residents to wear masks in indoor public settings amid concerning upticks in coronavirus cases and continued circulation of the highly contagious delta variant. The latest recommendations from Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Ventura raise to 17 the number of counties now asking even fully vaccinated individuals to wear face coverings as a precaution while inside places such as grocery stores, movie theaters and retail outlets. So far, only one – Los Angeles County – has gone a step further and mandated that masks be worn in such settings. The city of Pasadena, which has its own independent health department, said it would do likewise later this week. The new round of advisories means that roughly 56% of Californians live in a county that either recommends or requires indoor masking for all individuals, including those vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Marijuana-related arrests have dropped since the first recreational pot shops opened in Colorado seven years ago but Black people are still much more likely to get into legal trouble for cannabis offenses, according to a state report released Monday. The biennial report, commissioned by the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, found that the marijuana arrest rate for Black people (160 per 100,000 people) is more than double that for white people (76 per 100,000) in Colorado, The Denver Post reported. The report also found that people over 65 are using marijuana at triple the rate that they did in 2014 and that people are consuming cannabis through vapes and edibles at higher rates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Terrence Cheng, president of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, said the state’s community colleges will forgive $17 million of student debt accumulated during the pandemic. The debt, which students took on during the pandemic or could not repay because of it, will be made up with money from the federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Cheng said. There are no conditions attached, and students are not required to enroll in classes in any future semesters, Cheng said. The decision is expected to impact 18,161 current and former students at the state’s 12 community colleges, officials said. That includes students who lost jobs, suffered food insecurity and even those who were afflicted with COVID-19 said Jane Gates, CSCU’s provost and senior vice president of academic and student affairs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The Delaware Democratic Party said that anti-Asian slurs and other sexual language used by state Rep. Gerald Brady in an email “will not be tolerated,” but stopped short of demanding that he resign. The outcry came after a June 27 email sent by Brady was shared with The News Journal. The email was intended to be sent to a private citizen Brady knows, said Drew Volturo, a spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady replied to a sex workers’ advocate who had emailed him to discuss legislation intended to protect sex workers. “Misogynistic, anti-Asian language has no place in our Party and calls into question the integrity of any leader,” Betsy Maron, chair of the Delaware Democratic Party, said in a written statement. “No apology will rectify the fact that Representative Gerald Brady felt comfortable enough to use such hateful language behind closed doors.” When asked if the party was calling on Brady to step down, Democratic spokeswoman Sarah Fulton said no. “If Gerald Brady doesn’t want to resign, that’s something that he is going to have to deal with when he looks his constituents in the face next fall and tries to justify why they should vote for him,” Fulton said. Brady sent a written apology Monday through a spokesman. He also posted his apology on his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:For the first time in decades, D.C.’s Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will open to the public on April 18, 2022, WUSA-TV reported. According to a news release from the Church of Latter-day Saints, invited guests will be available to take private tours of the renovated temple between April 19-27. The temple will then hold a public open house for two months, except Sundays, starting April 28 and running through June 4.Ticket information for the public open house will be made available at the DC Temple website, here. The Church of Latter-day Saints said the Temple first opened in 1974 and was closed in March 2018 to undergo a significant renovation. According to Dan Holt, the project manager, the renovations added “21st-century flair” to the temple's midcentury motif to make the temple “more maintainable, more modern and really relevant for today.” The last time the temple was open to the public was from Sept. 17 to Oct. 19, in 1974, when more than 750,000 people toured the building.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Officials in Florida’s most populous county are encouraging residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as infection rates once again spike in the state. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and other government, public safety and health officials released a statement Tuesday urging people to take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Miami-Dade has achieved a vaccination rate of more than 75%, according to the Florida Department of Health. In less than a month, positive tests have increased from 3.6% to 8.6% in Miami-Dade County, officials said. In the last three weeks, the number of COVID-positive inpatients at Miami’s Jackson Health System has increased 178%. More than 95% of the new patients are unvaccinated, and more than 40% are under age 50.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations around the world is starting to reach Georgia, experts said, driven by the infection’s spread among the unvaccinated. Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nevada are in full-fledged outbreaks, and neighboring states are following behind, Emory University Professor Carlos del Rio said in a briefing. In the past week, Georgia’s hospitalizations from the disease have increased 30%, he said. The highly contagious delta variant now accounts for about 70% of all new cases, most of which are among those who haven’t been vaccinated, including children too young for the shots. Of the 480 Georgia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 this month, 416 were not fully vaccinated, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Dozens of Maui residents held a rally for affordable housing as the county’s median home price tops $1 million and the county council considers a new affordable housing plan. Stand Up Maui organized the affordable housing rally, which gathered more than 40 people along Kaahumanu Avenue on Monday, The Maui News reported. “Build affordable housing now,” resident Faith Chase yelled through a bullhorn. Median home prices in Maui County hit $1,117,500 in June – the highest in the state. The figure was up 45% from $773,250 during the same month last year. At the Maui County Council, a committee heard testimony about a new affordable housing plan. Some said the county should require that candidates for affordable housing have at least 20 years of residency. But the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Plan called for two years of residency. The affordable housing plan called for the county to spend $380 million on infrastructure, including roads, water and wastewater projects. Another $789 million would support housing for locals, including subsidies for rentals and mortgages.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, acting as governor with Gov. Brad Little out of the state, on Tuesday sent what she called a formal inquiry to the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare concerning private health care businesses requiring their employees get COVID-19 vaccines. McGeachin, who is running for governor, said the Biden administration could be behind the requirement, citing a lengthy proposed rule in the federal register published in May having to do with Medicare that has several references to vaccine coverage among health care workers. As acting governor in May, McGeachin issued an executive order banning mask mandates that Little nullified when he returned. Little is in Colorado meeting with other Republican governors and is scheduled to return Wednesday, spokeswoman Marissa Morrison said. McGeachin has said she wants to find out why three large Idaho health care providers are requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two state agencies that oversee higher education in Illinois on Monday encouraged colleges and universities to require COVID-19 vaccinations of students heading to campuses this fall. The Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois Community College Board made the recommendation, which they said follows recently released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state agencies contend the guidance will help facilitate the safe transition back to campus, as more students return to in-person learning. The oversight agencies’ recommendation came on the same day a federal judge ruled Indiana University can require its students and employees to get vaccinated before returning to campus for fall classes. Students who don’t comply will have their registration canceled and workers who don’t will lose their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said 60% of incoming students and 66% of school employees have submitted proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 four weeks ahead of an Aug. 13 fall semester deadline. Purdue announced the figures Tuesday in its first release of overall campus vaccination rates. Purdue said it is strongly encouraging all students and employees to get the vaccine if possible. The university expects the numbers of those fully vaccinated will grow before the first day of fall classes Aug. 23, said Eric Barker, dean of the College of Pharmacy and leader of the Protect Purdue Health Monitoring and Surveillance team. Vaccination rates for Purdue students are about twice the rate compared with individuals ages 16-29 across the state, the school said. Individuals not vaccinated who have a high-risk exposure must quarantine for 14 days and will not be allowed to attend classes or report to work, regardless of symptoms, Purdue said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a high-risk exposure as coming within 6 feet of an infected individual for 15 minutes or more where both individuals are not wearing masks.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Waterloo Community Schools will seek federal stimulus dollars to help fund internet access and computers for students whose families can’t afford them. The district is applying for money through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On Tuesday, the Board of Education approved the purchase of 593 Dell touchscreen Chromebook laptops at a cost of $148,843 during a special meeting. The ECF includes a provision that allows districts to seek funding for laptop computers when they will be used by students who lack devices sufficient to engage in remote learning. As a result, Waterloo Schools will “target our virtual students, who obviously need a suitable device,” said Matt O’Brien, the district’s director of technology. The touchscreen functionality has been identified as being important for the district’s virtual learners, especially those in elementary school. Reimbursement will be sought from the fund for the entire cost.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Families and advocates for the elderly in Kansas argue that with most nursing home residents vaccinated against COVID-19, some facilities’ visiting rules need to be relaxed, though the delta variant’s spread is making operators nervous. A state official who investigates complaints against nursing homes and the elder-care focused Kansas Advocates for Better Care are calling on the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services to crack down on homes that aren’t open enough. They’re concerned that the delta variant will prompt new lockdowns. The aging department said it is working to ensure that residents and families have a voice in visitation policies, though some industry officials still see a need to proceed with caution. The debate showed how operators feel they’re still facing tough choices after nursing homes were COVID-19 hot spots early on during the pandemic. It also shows how residents’ and families’ anguish and anger still linger.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State University’s president resigned Tuesday amid concerns about the school’s financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. The school’s Board of Regents accepted M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation at a specially called meeting, news media outlets reported. Brown’s resignation came after four years on the job. The regents named Clara Ross Stamps as the school’s acting president. Stamps has been a senior vice president and spokeswoman at the university. The board also voted to hire auditors to review the school’s financial situation. Stamps declined afterward to provide any information about possible problems or the reason for Brown’s departure, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Brown’s departure came amid a half-dozen lawsuits pending this year accusing college officials, including Brown, of various acts of misconduct, the newspaper reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and said it’s the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since June 19. The numbers were announced as state officials continued to stress the need for vaccination. Figures posted Wednesday showed 1.6 million people, about 36% of the state’s population are fully vaccinated. The seven-day average of new cases reported daily in New Orleans had jumped to 99 by Tuesday, up from 11 two weeks ago. Mayor LaToya Tidwell said vaccinations are the key to stopping the spread, which is fueled by the highly contagious delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. Restrictions on gatherings and mask requirements had been greatly eased in recent months as vaccines became widely available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has decided to continue a pandemic rule to allow outdoor dining and retail in place until at least the fall. Portland is looking to end a local emergency declaration about the pandemic on July 29. That would also end additional powers given to the city manager that can restrict public gatherings. However, street closures that allow businesses to expand outdoor dining and retail options will continue until November, the Portland Press Herald reported. The council voted that a designation allowing restaurants to operate without additional fees will continue until Nov. 1. A statewide emergency declaration about the pandemic ended in June. Maine has had a lower burden of coronavirus cases than many other states, though cases have increased somewhat in recent days.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The leader of the Maryland National Guard is warning that training missions and equipment maintenance are in peril if the state isn’t reimbursed soon for the Guard’s response to the Jan. 6 insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol. Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen, the adjutant general for the Maryland National Guard, warned in a letter Tuesday to members of Congress that the Guard is so short on money that he might have to resort to deep budget cuts in the coming weeks. Maryland Guard members were among the first to arrive in Washington on Jan. 6 when the Capitol building was disrupted during the certification of the 2020 election results. After a delay in getting the sign-off from federal officials, the state sent 500 Guard members, a number that swelled to about 1,000 over the next few weeks. The deployment to Washington came in the midst of an unprecedented and busy time for the Guard, whose members helped run coronavirus testing sites and food distribution programs and were preparing to staff mass vaccination clinics at the time of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City health officials urged recent visitors to Provincetown to self-isolate and get tested for the coronavirus after a cluster of cases was linked to the popular Cape Cod tourist town. At least 35 cases of COVID-19 in Boston have been traced to Provincetown, with the vast majority of cases involving people who were fully vaccinated, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. Anyone who has traveled to Provincetown since July 1 is being asked to get tested at least five days after returning. The travel guidance also asks recent visitors to self-isolate and avoid gatherings for at least five days and until they receive a negative coronavirus test. Provincetown officials issued a new mask advisory on Monday after more than 100 people tested positive following the Fourth of July holiday. The advisory encourages mask-wearing for all residents and visitors of the town, which is a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Marais: A wildfire burned about 6 acres of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and adjacent state forest in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard vessel reported the fire about 3 p.m. Monday near the Twelvemile Beach campground at Pictured Rocks, they said. Park rangers said large amounts of smoke might linger for the next few days in the area and along Highway 58 near the Kingston Lake campground. The investigation into how the fire started is continuing. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Burt Township firefighters and Pictured Rocks park rangers extinguished the fire.“Thank you to all our agency partners who reported and helped us keep this fire under control,” Chief Ranger Joseph Hughes said in a statement. “I would like to remind all park visitors to recreate safely. Drivers and visitors should slow down and use caution in the area.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota’s most populous county is boosting its incentive program for COVID-19 vaccine shots. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved an additional $250,000 to promote vaccine shots, on top of the original $100,000 that was allocated earlier from federal recovery funds. Commissioner Chris LaTondresse said the program has increased the number of shots and Tuesday’s action “doubles down on this promising strategy” to help fight the coronavirus. The county used the original investment to buy 2,235 Visa gift cards worth $50 each. As of Monday. about 775 of those cards had been distributed, mainly at county public health events. The incentive program includes partnerships with community groups to host vaccine events and provide perks such as free meals, groceries, and entertainment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With a national moratorium on evictions scheduled to end at the end of this month, millions of dollars in federal rental and utility assistance is still available for low-income tenants in Mississippi. The funds, provided by Congress, are disbursed through the Mississippi Home Corporation. Eligible for the benefits are Mississippians making 80% or less of the median area income whose ability to pay rent or utilities was disrupted by the pandemic. For example, in Hinds County, a three-person household making $52,300 or less a year is eligible for assistance. There is more than $180 million available to state residents, and Home Corporation Executive Director Scott Spivey said he hopes more people apply for the assistance.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The St. Louis area is facing a third wave of COVID-19 that could cause more deaths and serious cases if residents don’t get vaccinated and return to wearing masks in public, the head of the region’s pandemic task force said. Dr. Clay Dunagan, BJC HealthCare’s chief clinical officer, said seven COVID-19 patients have died in the St. Louis region and 91 were admitted to intensive care units during the 24 hours before he issued his plea Tuesday morning. He said if residents don’t respond, the area could return to high hospitalization rates, prompting renewed visitor restrictions and delayed elective procedures. He said even people who have been vaccinated should wear masks in public, in part because only 46.3% of Missourians had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, which significantly trailed the national average. Also Tuesday, officials from St. Louis County and St. Louis issued a joint statement echoing Dunagan’s remarks. They said they are watching trends and paying attention to mask mandates initiated by other jurisdictions.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Environmental groups pressed a state judge to order a new review of a Montana copper mine over worries that mining waste will pollute a river that’s popular among boaters. Attorneys for Trout Unlimited and other groups argued that state officials did not adequately review the risk of toxic waste spills from the Black Butte copper mine north of White Sulphur Springs. Work began last year on the mine along Sheep Creek, a tributary of the Smith River. Montana Department of Environmental Quality attorney Sarah Clerget rejected worries the mine would pollute the Smith during Friday’s hearing before state District Judge Katherine Bidegary in Meagher County. Clerget said the mine won’t leak or fail, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The underground mine proposed by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. The 110-mile Smith River runs through a limestone canyon and a scenic valley before flowing into the Missouri River south of Great Falls. The waterway is so popular the state holds an annual lottery for permits to float down it.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinnebago: A mask mandate has been reinstated on the Winnebago Reservation to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska said in a post on its Facebook page that masks are required for all indoors in public buildings and places of business within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. During a meeting Monday, the Winnebago Tribal Council voted 6-1 to reinstate the mask mandate. According to a report from Twelve Clans Unity Hospital, as of Monday, there were 12 active cases of the virus on the reservation and six households in quarantine. On June 25, the Winnebago Public Health Department reported that 70% of community members ages 12 and up had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Tribal officials touted the vaccination rate as the highest in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei said he hasn’t decided whether to run for reelection or mount a bid for Nevada governor, but appears unimpressed by the Republican primary field vying to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Certainly no one has sucked the air out of the room, in a Republican primary sense, which Steve Sisolak must be happy about. Nevada Republicans need a strong gubernatorial candidate in 2022,” he said. Amodei, a Carson City Republican, said he didn’t feel rushed to make a decision with the primary election 11 months away. If he enters the race, Amodei will join Sheriff Joe Lombardo, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee and Reno attorney Joey Gilbert in the Republican primary field. Former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller has told Republican groups that he’s also mulling a run. Amodei has served in Congress since 2011 and previously represented Carson City in the Nevada statehouse. He continues to raise campaign contributions toward another congressional run.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: Surveyors with the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands have found widespread defoliation attributed to a population boom of moth caterpillars. Kyle Lombard, the coordinator of the division’s forest health program, said that the department has surveyed 20% of the state and found 30,000 acres of defoliation. The affected trees are primarily clumps of red and black oaks, WCVB-TV reported. According to the department, the last time the state experienced more than 10,000 to 15,000 acres of defoliation was in 1992. Lombard said that areas with a lot of oaks will look weird; however, the defoliation should not affect the foliage season. The trees that largely produce the bright oranges, reds and yellows are primarily maples, aspens and ash, which are not affected by the moth larvae. Lombard said that the real concern is that if the moth population continues to expand, it will increase the amount of dry brush across a larger area, increasing the risk of fires.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A state appeals court ruled Gov. Phil Murphy didn’t overstep his authority when he issued an executive order last year allowing tenants to use their security deposits to pay rent. The ruling rejected arguments by several businesses and individual landlords who argued Murphy wasn’t authorized to issue the order in April 2020 and that their due process rights were violated. In a tweet, Acting State Attorney General Andrew Bruck praised the ruling and said Murphy’s executive order “supported renters and helped keep them in their homes.” The attorney general’s office argued the case on behalf of Murphy, a Democrat; former attorney general Gurbir Grewal and state health commissioner Judy Persichilli, who also were named as defendants. Under Murphy’s order, landlords were still entitled to reimbursement for expenses that would have been covered by a security deposit, and tenants were obligated to replenish the deposit in full if they renewed the lease.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMalaga: The U.S. Geological Survey recorded an earthquake near the Eddy and Lea County line Monday morning, nearly 23 miles east-southeast of Malaga. Susan Torres, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department , said the earthquake was reported about 5:30 a.m. The USGS considered the earthquake light. The Carlsbad Brine Well remediation project, located south of Carlsbad where U.S. highways 285 and 62/180 converge to form the South Y, detected the activity. The readings indicated the Brine Well pressure was stable. Eddy County Fire and Rescue Chief Joshua Mack said volunteer fire departments did not respond to any emergency calls in the area. Carlsbad Fire Chief Richard Lopez said no damage or injuries were reported in the city limits. The USGS has reported six other earthquakes near the Texas-New Mexico state line nearly 60 miles south of Carlsbad since July 13. The magnitude of those earthquakes was less than 4.0.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will have to get vaccinated or get tested weekly under a policy announced Wednesday to fight a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Publicly employed nurses, doctors, social workers, custodians, registrars and colleagues will be covered under the order from city Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi, and Mayor Bill de Blasio didn’t rule out applying the same requirement to teachers, police officers and other city employees. The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated. But the rate among public hospital system workers is lower: about 60%, according to Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs it. Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children would need parental permission before they could receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use in legislation that advanced through a state Senate committee Wednesday. The parent or guardian requirement is contained in a bill approved by the Senate Health Care Committee that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The permission is designed to address concerns by some parents and legislators that young people could get a new COVID-19 immunization on their own while it is still authorized for emergency use, said Sen. Jim Burgin, a Harnett County Republican. Only the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is available to children from 12 to 17. North Carolina law allows these children to make the decision on their own, “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Oil production is flat in North Dakota because of a workforce shortage as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Companies said they are in need of workers to inject water, sand and chemicals down wells to crack open rock and release oil, a process known as hydraulic fracking. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said eight crews are working in North Dakota, down from at least 20 which would typically be working in the state at today’s oil prices. “Most of these folks went to Texas where activity was still significantly higher than it was here, where they didn’t have winter and where there were jobs in their industry,” Helms told the Bismarck Tribune. “It’s going to take higher pay and housing incentives and that sort of thing to get them here.” North Dakota’s oil production rose 4,000 barrels per day in May, a negligible increase. The state produced about 1 million barrels of oil per day in May, the latest month for which data is available. The fracking side of the industry is also experimenting with new techniques to reduce costs. One company is using saltwater to replace some of the freshwater used in the fracking process. The fluid is being transported several miles through a flat line hose tucked inside another hose to prevent leaks until it reaches a fracking site, Helms said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio anti-abortion group is protesting a local Catholic university’s involvement in playing host to President Joe Biden in a CNN town hall Wednesday night. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati urged members of the public Tuesday to call Mount St. Joseph University and Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis Schnurr to object to the school’s decision. The group, which opposes abortion, said the suburban Cincinnati university is playing host to the “most pro-abortion president in U.S. history.” Biden, the nation’s second Catholic president, has said he supports abortion rights for others while personally opposing the procedure. He and other Catholic politicians who take Communion while supporting abortion rights were the subject of a rebuke by U.S. bishops last month. The university defended its involvement in the event, saying in a statement that Mount St. Joseph “has always been and will continue to be a diverse and inclusive place where people from different races, ethnicities, social backgrounds, beliefs, and religions can come together to discuss and share their unique perspectives.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A coalition of state health officials pleaded with Oklahomans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus as the number of cases and hospitalizations rise in the state. Aaron Wendelboe, an epidemiologist at the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health, said hospitalizations have nearly tripled since June. The state health department reported a seven-day average of 733 new cases daily, double the average of 364 from a week ago. “On average, each infected person with COVID is transmitting it to 2.9 other people,” compared to each infected person who transmitted the illness to two people in June, Wendelboe said. The health department reported a three-day average of 409 people hospitalized with COVID, almost four times the average of 116 in late June, topping 400 for the first time since early June. Assistant Deputy Health Commissioner Buffy Heater said 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, “which further indicates to us that vaccines are safe and continue to be effective against all strains or all variants of COVID.” Oklahoma ranks ninth in the nation with 209.2 new virus cases per 100,000 residents, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is being forced to make immediate and extensive changes to the way it operates the 13 dams in the Willamette Valley, including Detroit Dam, to give native species of fish a chance to survive. Under an order from U.S. District Court Judge Marco Hernandez issued July 16, the Corps will be forced to take actions such as improving fish passage and water quality, deep drawdowns of water to allow juvenile fish to pass downstream, spilling water at different times of year, and releasing adult fish above the dams. Hernandez's order laid out broad actions; a later final judgment will contain specifics. According to a statement from the Corps, it is reviewing Hernandez’s opinion to determine the next steps it will take to comply with it.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Local Catholics attending Mass last Sunday sounded happy that Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson Pérez has reinstated the religious obligation to attend Mass in person starting next month, ending a 16-month dispensation during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think he should have done it a long time ago,” said Nathan Hook, just before he and his fiancée, Jessica Rosario, walked into St. Agatha-St. James Church in West Philadelphia. “The dispensation makes people think church isn’t that important. But you need to be in person to receive the sacraments.” The in-person attendance directive, effective Aug. 15, has exceptions. Just as before the pandemic, the church recognizes that people might not be able to gather in person because of illness, caregiving responsibilities, or health risks. Pérez’s statement said lingering pandemic anxiety about crowds is also a valid reason to stay home and, if possible, join online.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s courts are preparing to resume regular operations this fall. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell issued an executive order that will lift most coronavirus restrictions by Sept. 7. The Boston Globe reported the new order will allow the public to return to all judicial buildings, with some restrictions. Fully vaccinated people will not be required to wear a mask, unless judges mandate it in their courtrooms. The public will be able to file court documents in-person by Sept. 7. Coronavirus cleaning protocols and plexiglass safety barriers installed in courtrooms will remain at least until the end of the year. During the early days of the pandemic, Suttell ordered courts shuttered for all but emergency matters. Like other court systems, most judicial proceedings were held remotely. The court system has been easing back into in-person operations with grand juries and bench trials resuming last summer. Jury trials resumed late last year as some courtrooms were outfitted with plexiglass.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Three Republican U.S. House members have lost appeals challenging fines for not wearing face coverings on the House floor earlier this year. On Tuesday, the U.S. House Ethics Committee released statements noting that U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina had failed in their appeals of $500 fines issued in May. The Republicans challenged the fines in June, arguing that the mandate was out of sync with recent federal guidance on face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vote in question happened a week after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance noting that “fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing.” At the time, face coverings were still required on the floor, a mandate put in place by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in June 2020. Even after the updated CDC guidance in May, Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, wrote that “mask requirement and other guidelines remain unchanged until all Members and floor staff are fully vaccinated.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A fraternity of the far-right group Proud Boys has withdrawn its sponsorship of a street dance in the town of Scotland in September. David Finnell applied on behalf of the group to have the street dance from noon until midnight Sept. 18 in the Bon Homme County community of about 700 people. The City Council approved the request to close a section of the city street as required for alcohol consumption and food vendors. Finnell, in a Facebook message to KELO-TV, said the Proud Boys were dropping sponsorship of the event out of concerns for safety. He did not elaborate. Scotland’s city attorney, Kent Lehr, said although the Proud Boys have gained some negative national attention, there have not been any problems locally. It’s his understanding that several local or area residents are associated with the Proud Boys, Lehr said. “I’m not saying the city is condoning or agreeing with what the group says,” Lehr said. The council had to evaluate the street dance request from the Proud Boys as it evaluates any other request, he said. “It has to consider the benefit to the community, any potential disruption (to closing street and caused by the event), the benefit to businesses on Main Street,” Lehr said. Finnell said the Proud Boys planned to raise money for local nonprofits before deciding on Monday to withdraw from the event.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials said they have finished deconstructing emergency COVID-19 care sites in Nashville and Memphis. According to a news release, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said this week that the sites finished serving their purpose of providing additional hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients. “Tennessee’s alternate care sites provided our health care system with a margin of safety, and thankfully we did not need to open either site,” Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement. The Memphis site, which was the former home of The Commercial Appeal, was renovated to provide more than 400 beds. The Nashville site opened in late May and provided 67 beds. “The Memphis and Nashville sites are models of what the public and private sector can accomplish working together,” TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan said in a statement. All medical equipment and supplies from both sites have been returned to TEMA’s warehouse.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Emergency officials have lifted a shelter-in-place order that was issued Wednesday morning for parts of a Houston-area city after a chemical release at a plant. The order had been issued for parts of La Porte, a city about 25 miles southeast of Houston. La Porte Emergency Management said earlier that residents in the affected area should stay indoors, turn their air conditioning off and close windows. Dow Chemical, which operates a plant in the area, said in a public alert message that a “release event” from a tank truck had occurred but did not specify what chemicals were involved. Harris County Pollution Control said in a statement that a tank wagon overpressurized, which caused a release of the chemical hydroxyethyl acrylate. The chemical can cause irritation of the nose and throat, the statement said. An evacuation order remained in place for people within a half-mile of the plant, which is located in an industrial area.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The Utah County sheriff is offering an active-shooter training class for teachers and it has filled up long before its start date. Trainers at the Teachers Academy include police, self-defense trainers and medical professionals for the 20-hour course informed by lessons learned in other active shooter incidents, the Daily Herald reported. Topics covered during the Teacher Academy training will include tactical emergency medical techniques, weapons familiarization, Utah concealed carry certification, tactical de-escalation, self-defense and live range-shooting. This is the third Teachers Academy class held since 2019. It’s designed for teachers, administrators, and school support staff. Participants for the session beginning Aug. 3 are limited to 30 people, and spots have already filled up and a wait list has started.\n\nVermont\n\nHyde Park: Grappling with a changed industry, two brothers operating their family’s dairy farm have made the drastic decision to give up hundreds of cows for goats. The Jones family, which had raised cows for 150 years at Joneslan Farm, houses about 1,000 goats in their barn that remains adorned with painted cutouts of dairy cattle. Fluctuating milk prices paid to dairy cow farmers and rising costs have driven some small family farms to go big or out of business – or get creative like brothers Brian and Steven. The Jones brothers finished constructing their nanny-milking parlor and delivered their first goat milk earlier this year to Land O’ Lakes-owned Vermont Creamery, to be used for cheese-making. They plan to milk 1,200 to 1,500 dairy goats within two years. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of dairy cow farms fell by more than half between 2003 and 2020 while the number of cows nationwide grew as farms consolidated. At the same time, the dairy goat industry in the U.S. has grown significantly in the last 20 years, with the number of dairy goats rising from more than 190,000 in 1997 to 440,000 last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration issued new guidance Wednesday on COVID-19 prevention measures for the upcoming school year, urging but not requiring continued masking in many circumstances. With a statewide public health order that had mandated masking in schools coming to an end Sunday, school divisions will have the ability to implement local policies “based on community level conditions and public health recommendations,” the Democratic administration said in a news release. The departments of health and education released a 14-page document with advice about reducing the spread of the coronavirus, addressing issues like ventilation and physical distancing, in addition to masking. The recommendations urge school divisions for now to adopt a universal masking policy for students and adults in elementary schools, regardless of vaccination status, because no vaccine has been approved yet for children under 12. For middle and high schools, the state guidance said that “at a minimum” teachers, students and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated should wear masks indoors. The guidance provides flexibility for school divisions while ensuring a safe and healthy environment, Northam said in a statement, which also encouraged Virginians to get vaccinated if they have not already.\n\nWashington\n\nKelso: Authorities are searching for an Army lieutenant reported missing near Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington. The Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office said crews are searching for a missing hiker, identified as 1st Lt. Brian Yang in the Coldwater area of Mount St. Helens. KOIN reported Yang, 25, was last seen at the Coldwater Trail Head about noon Sunday. According to its Twitter account, the Army’s I Corps is aware of Yang’s absence and is also involved in the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Dozens of labor and advocacy groups called on President Joe Biden to save nearly 1,500 jobs at a pharmaceutical plant in West Virginia scheduled to close at the end of July. Drugmaker Viatris Inc. announced in December it will lay off workers at the Morgantown plant, formerly operated by the generic drug company Mylan. Upjohn and Mylan’s merged last year to form the new company, which announced it would slash 20% of its workforce worldwide. Viatris is now one of the world’s dominant manufacturers in the generics industry, which has been consolidating for years. The moves left workers scrambling to find new jobs as the major employer left West Virginia, which is often trying to lure new companies to uplift the state’s stagnant economy. A new campaign led by Our Revolution, a political nonprofit organization founded by Bernie Sanders, urged Biden to use the Defense Production Act to halt Pittsburgh-based Viatris from closing the plant. It also asks Biden to convene a task force of labor groups, local leaders and others to determine how the plant might continue producing pharmaceutical or medical goods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is again asking ruffed grouse hunters to submit samples during the final year of a four-year, multistate ruffed grouse West Nile virus study. The DNR and conservation partners will distribute testing kits to hunters to get more samples as biologists try to determine how many grouse are getting West Nile and what impacts the disease is having on the grouse population. Anyone else who finds a sick or entact dead grouse can also submit samples. Hunters who have a kit from a previous year are encouraged to collect a sample, fill the kit and send it in to be processed; nothing in the kit expires. Kits will be available in early September. The DNR might limit the number of kits per individual to ensure samples come from a large geographic area. The DNR will provide test results via email. Sample testing will not begin until after the grouse season has closed and final results will not be available for several months after that. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus and its effects on birds can vary. Signs range from no clinical disease or illness to heart lesions and inflammation of the brain’s lining and spinal cord. There is no evidence that West Nile can be spread by handling dead birds or consuming properly cooked game.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon is allowing truck drivers to work longer hours while they deliver fuel that might be needed for firefighting aircraft. So far this summer, Wyoming hasn’t had significant fuel shortages or major wildfires. Gordon’s office described Tuesday’s executive order as a preemptive measure because of high fuel demand amid record tourism and firefighting efforts elsewhere. “Part of the reason he signed the executive order was really to make sure that it wasn’t a transportation hiccup that was preventing fuel from making it to its destination,” Gordon spokesman Michael Pearlman told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other Western governors, including South Dakota’s Kristi Noem, have signed similar orders. Government rules usually limit truck drivers’ road hours to prevent fatigue-related accidents. The Wyoming order still prohibits truck drivers from driving when tired.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/09/conch-contest-golf-tree-geena-davis-news-around-states/111409522/", "title": "Conch contest, golf tree: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would ban gender therapies such as prescription hormones or gender confirmation surgery for minors. The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}]}

The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/17/coronavirus-takes-toll-las-cruces-all-you-need-know/5069222002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Southern New Mexico: What you need to know about ...", "text": "The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is upending all of our lives.

The federal government has also announced it will be making direct payments to taxpayers as part of its relief efforts.\n\nCriminals target taxpayers as well as tax preparers because of the opportunity that presents to steal information on multiple taxpayers all at once, the department stated.\n\nPotential targets may receive phone calls or emails with messaging such as “in order to receive your/your client’s stimulus payment via direct deposit, we need you to confirm the banking information,” according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, most people will not need to take any action to receive their stimulus payments, as the payments will be distributed automatically.

Individuals may coerce victims into providing sexually explicit images or videos of themselves, often in compliance with offenders’ threats to post the images publicly or send the images to victims’ friends and family.\n\nOther offenders may make casual contact with children online, gain their trust, and introduce sexual conversation that increases in egregiousness over time. Ultimately this activity may result in maintaining an online relationship that includes sexual conversation and the exchange of illicit images, to eventually physically meeting the child in-person.\n\nIn order for the victimization to stop, children typically have to come forward to someone they trust — typically a parent, teacher, caregiver or law enforcement, the agency stated. The embarrassment of being enticed and/or coerced to engage in unwanted behavior is what often prevents children from coming forward. Offenders may have hundreds of victims around the world, so coming forward to help law enforcement identify offenders may prevent countless other incidents of sexual exploitation.\n\nAbuse can occur offline through direct contact with another individual. During these uncertain conditions, where time with other adults and caregivers has increased immensely, parents/guardians should communicate with their children about appropriate contact with adults and watch for any changes in behavior, including an increase in nightmares, withdrawn behavior, angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, not wanting to be left alone with an individual, and sexual knowledge.\n\nParents and guardians are urged to take the following measures to help educate and prevent children from becoming victims of child predators and sexual exploitation during this time of national emergency:\n\nDiscuss Internet safety with children of all ages when they engage in online activity.\n\nReview and approve games and apps before they are downloaded.\n\nMake sure privacy settings are set to the strictest level possible for online gaming systems and electronic devices.\n\nMonitor your children’s use of the Internet; keep electronic devices in an open, common room of the house.\n\nCheck your children’s profiles and what they post online.\n\nExplain to your children that images posted online will be permanently on the Internet.\n\nMake sure children know that anyone who asks a child to engage in sexually explicit activity online should be reported to a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult and law enforcement.\n\nCrime:Sunland Park mother charged after 4 children, including newborn, test positive for drugs\n\nMore information about the FBI’s guidance on protecting children from sexual exploitation is available at https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/protecting-your-kids.\n\n1:40 PM: MountainView Regional Medical Center tightens restrictions on visitors\n\nMountainView Regional Medical Center on Tuesday announced tighter restrictions on all visitors in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in New Mexico, and continuing efforts to slow community spread of the disease.\n\nBeginning Wednesday morning, the private hospital said it will bar all visitors, vendors and contractors with a few, specific exceptions.

Over the Unit Training Assembly weekend of July 10-11, more than 100 Reserve Citizen Airmen from the 908th participated in the testing in Montgomery, Ala., which provided wing leadership with important data. Healthy and fit airmen are better equipped to mitigate the stresses of living and working in the austere environments often encountered at deployed locations. However, social distancing protocols limited the options airmen had to participate in physical training.

Now that restrictions have been lifted and testing has resumed, some airmen have regained the incentive to maintain an exercise regimen and healthier lifestyle.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state-run ferry system is proposing a winter schedule that suggests limited service for some southeast Alaskan communities and improved service for Kodiak Island and some parts of south-central Alaska. State transportation department spokesperson Andy Mills told CoastAlaska the draft schedule reflects the best the state can do given available funding and maintenance needs within the fleet. Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed about $8.5 million for vessel operations, which his budget office said would “align service with historical demand, while providing 18 months of funding to align the system’s budget with the calendar year.” The move to provide funding for operations for 18 months rather than the traditional 12 months was intended in part to provide more stability in scheduling. The draft, which the transportation department is taking public comment on, covers operations between October and April and calls for up to five ships operating at any one time. One of those, however, is a ferry that shuttles between Ketchikan and nearby Metlakatla.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State wildlife officials and conservationists are offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects in the recent poaching of a desert bighorn sheep at Gillespie Dam southwest of Phoenix.

Investigators said a group of five Asian males seen leaving the scene at approximately 8:30 p.m. in a gray sedan and a black sport utility vehicle might have been involved. Anyone with information can call Operation Game Thief hotline at (800) 352-0700 regarding case #21-002114. Tipsters might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 for information that leads to an arrest in this case. The Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society is offering an additional reward of $1,000 for information that leads to a conviction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Public health researchers called the rapid rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas a “raging forest fire,” and the state’s top health official warned that he expects significant outbreaks in schools. The model by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases a day in children under age 17. Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated. Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a “surge on top of this surge” when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated. Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Six more California counties are urging residents to wear masks in indoor public settings amid concerning upticks in coronavirus cases and continued circulation of the highly contagious delta variant. The latest recommendations from Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Ventura raise to 17 the number of counties now asking even fully vaccinated individuals to wear face coverings as a precaution while inside places such as grocery stores, movie theaters and retail outlets. So far, only one – Los Angeles County – has gone a step further and mandated that masks be worn in such settings. The city of Pasadena, which has its own independent health department, said it would do likewise later this week. The new round of advisories means that roughly 56% of Californians live in a county that either recommends or requires indoor masking for all individuals, including those vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Marijuana-related arrests have dropped since the first recreational pot shops opened in Colorado seven years ago but Black people are still much more likely to get into legal trouble for cannabis offenses, according to a state report released Monday. The biennial report, commissioned by the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, found that the marijuana arrest rate for Black people (160 per 100,000 people) is more than double that for white people (76 per 100,000) in Colorado, The Denver Post reported. The report also found that people over 65 are using marijuana at triple the rate that they did in 2014 and that people are consuming cannabis through vapes and edibles at higher rates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Terrence Cheng, president of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, said the state’s community colleges will forgive $17 million of student debt accumulated during the pandemic. The debt, which students took on during the pandemic or could not repay because of it, will be made up with money from the federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Cheng said. There are no conditions attached, and students are not required to enroll in classes in any future semesters, Cheng said. The decision is expected to impact 18,161 current and former students at the state’s 12 community colleges, officials said. That includes students who lost jobs, suffered food insecurity and even those who were afflicted with COVID-19 said Jane Gates, CSCU’s provost and senior vice president of academic and student affairs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The Delaware Democratic Party said that anti-Asian slurs and other sexual language used by state Rep. Gerald Brady in an email “will not be tolerated,” but stopped short of demanding that he resign. The outcry came after a June 27 email sent by Brady was shared with The News Journal. The email was intended to be sent to a private citizen Brady knows, said Drew Volturo, a spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady replied to a sex workers’ advocate who had emailed him to discuss legislation intended to protect sex workers. “Misogynistic, anti-Asian language has no place in our Party and calls into question the integrity of any leader,” Betsy Maron, chair of the Delaware Democratic Party, said in a written statement. “No apology will rectify the fact that Representative Gerald Brady felt comfortable enough to use such hateful language behind closed doors.” When asked if the party was calling on Brady to step down, Democratic spokeswoman Sarah Fulton said no. “If Gerald Brady doesn’t want to resign, that’s something that he is going to have to deal with when he looks his constituents in the face next fall and tries to justify why they should vote for him,” Fulton said. Brady sent a written apology Monday through a spokesman. He also posted his apology on his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:For the first time in decades, D.C.’s Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will open to the public on April 18, 2022, WUSA-TV reported. According to a news release from the Church of Latter-day Saints, invited guests will be available to take private tours of the renovated temple between April 19-27. The temple will then hold a public open house for two months, except Sundays, starting April 28 and running through June 4.Ticket information for the public open house will be made available at the DC Temple website, here. The Church of Latter-day Saints said the Temple first opened in 1974 and was closed in March 2018 to undergo a significant renovation. According to Dan Holt, the project manager, the renovations added “21st-century flair” to the temple's midcentury motif to make the temple “more maintainable, more modern and really relevant for today.” The last time the temple was open to the public was from Sept. 17 to Oct. 19, in 1974, when more than 750,000 people toured the building.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Officials in Florida’s most populous county are encouraging residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as infection rates once again spike in the state. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and other government, public safety and health officials released a statement Tuesday urging people to take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Miami-Dade has achieved a vaccination rate of more than 75%, according to the Florida Department of Health. In less than a month, positive tests have increased from 3.6% to 8.6% in Miami-Dade County, officials said. In the last three weeks, the number of COVID-positive inpatients at Miami’s Jackson Health System has increased 178%. More than 95% of the new patients are unvaccinated, and more than 40% are under age 50.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations around the world is starting to reach Georgia, experts said, driven by the infection’s spread among the unvaccinated. Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nevada are in full-fledged outbreaks, and neighboring states are following behind, Emory University Professor Carlos del Rio said in a briefing. In the past week, Georgia’s hospitalizations from the disease have increased 30%, he said. The highly contagious delta variant now accounts for about 70% of all new cases, most of which are among those who haven’t been vaccinated, including children too young for the shots. Of the 480 Georgia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 this month, 416 were not fully vaccinated, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Dozens of Maui residents held a rally for affordable housing as the county’s median home price tops $1 million and the county council considers a new affordable housing plan. Stand Up Maui organized the affordable housing rally, which gathered more than 40 people along Kaahumanu Avenue on Monday, The Maui News reported. “Build affordable housing now,” resident Faith Chase yelled through a bullhorn. Median home prices in Maui County hit $1,117,500 in June – the highest in the state. The figure was up 45% from $773,250 during the same month last year. At the Maui County Council, a committee heard testimony about a new affordable housing plan. Some said the county should require that candidates for affordable housing have at least 20 years of residency. But the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Plan called for two years of residency. The affordable housing plan called for the county to spend $380 million on infrastructure, including roads, water and wastewater projects. Another $789 million would support housing for locals, including subsidies for rentals and mortgages.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, acting as governor with Gov. Brad Little out of the state, on Tuesday sent what she called a formal inquiry to the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare concerning private health care businesses requiring their employees get COVID-19 vaccines. McGeachin, who is running for governor, said the Biden administration could be behind the requirement, citing a lengthy proposed rule in the federal register published in May having to do with Medicare that has several references to vaccine coverage among health care workers. As acting governor in May, McGeachin issued an executive order banning mask mandates that Little nullified when he returned. Little is in Colorado meeting with other Republican governors and is scheduled to return Wednesday, spokeswoman Marissa Morrison said. McGeachin has said she wants to find out why three large Idaho health care providers are requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two state agencies that oversee higher education in Illinois on Monday encouraged colleges and universities to require COVID-19 vaccinations of students heading to campuses this fall. The Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois Community College Board made the recommendation, which they said follows recently released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state agencies contend the guidance will help facilitate the safe transition back to campus, as more students return to in-person learning. The oversight agencies’ recommendation came on the same day a federal judge ruled Indiana University can require its students and employees to get vaccinated before returning to campus for fall classes. Students who don’t comply will have their registration canceled and workers who don’t will lose their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said 60% of incoming students and 66% of school employees have submitted proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 four weeks ahead of an Aug. 13 fall semester deadline. Purdue announced the figures Tuesday in its first release of overall campus vaccination rates. Purdue said it is strongly encouraging all students and employees to get the vaccine if possible. The university expects the numbers of those fully vaccinated will grow before the first day of fall classes Aug. 23, said Eric Barker, dean of the College of Pharmacy and leader of the Protect Purdue Health Monitoring and Surveillance team. Vaccination rates for Purdue students are about twice the rate compared with individuals ages 16-29 across the state, the school said. Individuals not vaccinated who have a high-risk exposure must quarantine for 14 days and will not be allowed to attend classes or report to work, regardless of symptoms, Purdue said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a high-risk exposure as coming within 6 feet of an infected individual for 15 minutes or more where both individuals are not wearing masks.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Waterloo Community Schools will seek federal stimulus dollars to help fund internet access and computers for students whose families can’t afford them. The district is applying for money through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On Tuesday, the Board of Education approved the purchase of 593 Dell touchscreen Chromebook laptops at a cost of $148,843 during a special meeting. The ECF includes a provision that allows districts to seek funding for laptop computers when they will be used by students who lack devices sufficient to engage in remote learning. As a result, Waterloo Schools will “target our virtual students, who obviously need a suitable device,” said Matt O’Brien, the district’s director of technology. The touchscreen functionality has been identified as being important for the district’s virtual learners, especially those in elementary school. Reimbursement will be sought from the fund for the entire cost.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Families and advocates for the elderly in Kansas argue that with most nursing home residents vaccinated against COVID-19, some facilities’ visiting rules need to be relaxed, though the delta variant’s spread is making operators nervous. A state official who investigates complaints against nursing homes and the elder-care focused Kansas Advocates for Better Care are calling on the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services to crack down on homes that aren’t open enough. They’re concerned that the delta variant will prompt new lockdowns. The aging department said it is working to ensure that residents and families have a voice in visitation policies, though some industry officials still see a need to proceed with caution. The debate showed how operators feel they’re still facing tough choices after nursing homes were COVID-19 hot spots early on during the pandemic. It also shows how residents’ and families’ anguish and anger still linger.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State University’s president resigned Tuesday amid concerns about the school’s financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. The school’s Board of Regents accepted M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation at a specially called meeting, news media outlets reported. Brown’s resignation came after four years on the job. The regents named Clara Ross Stamps as the school’s acting president. Stamps has been a senior vice president and spokeswoman at the university. The board also voted to hire auditors to review the school’s financial situation. Stamps declined afterward to provide any information about possible problems or the reason for Brown’s departure, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Brown’s departure came amid a half-dozen lawsuits pending this year accusing college officials, including Brown, of various acts of misconduct, the newspaper reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and said it’s the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since June 19. The numbers were announced as state officials continued to stress the need for vaccination. Figures posted Wednesday showed 1.6 million people, about 36% of the state’s population are fully vaccinated. The seven-day average of new cases reported daily in New Orleans had jumped to 99 by Tuesday, up from 11 two weeks ago. Mayor LaToya Tidwell said vaccinations are the key to stopping the spread, which is fueled by the highly contagious delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. Restrictions on gatherings and mask requirements had been greatly eased in recent months as vaccines became widely available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has decided to continue a pandemic rule to allow outdoor dining and retail in place until at least the fall. Portland is looking to end a local emergency declaration about the pandemic on July 29. That would also end additional powers given to the city manager that can restrict public gatherings. However, street closures that allow businesses to expand outdoor dining and retail options will continue until November, the Portland Press Herald reported. The council voted that a designation allowing restaurants to operate without additional fees will continue until Nov. 1. A statewide emergency declaration about the pandemic ended in June. Maine has had a lower burden of coronavirus cases than many other states, though cases have increased somewhat in recent days.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The leader of the Maryland National Guard is warning that training missions and equipment maintenance are in peril if the state isn’t reimbursed soon for the Guard’s response to the Jan. 6 insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol. Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen, the adjutant general for the Maryland National Guard, warned in a letter Tuesday to members of Congress that the Guard is so short on money that he might have to resort to deep budget cuts in the coming weeks. Maryland Guard members were among the first to arrive in Washington on Jan. 6 when the Capitol building was disrupted during the certification of the 2020 election results. After a delay in getting the sign-off from federal officials, the state sent 500 Guard members, a number that swelled to about 1,000 over the next few weeks. The deployment to Washington came in the midst of an unprecedented and busy time for the Guard, whose members helped run coronavirus testing sites and food distribution programs and were preparing to staff mass vaccination clinics at the time of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City health officials urged recent visitors to Provincetown to self-isolate and get tested for the coronavirus after a cluster of cases was linked to the popular Cape Cod tourist town. At least 35 cases of COVID-19 in Boston have been traced to Provincetown, with the vast majority of cases involving people who were fully vaccinated, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. Anyone who has traveled to Provincetown since July 1 is being asked to get tested at least five days after returning. The travel guidance also asks recent visitors to self-isolate and avoid gatherings for at least five days and until they receive a negative coronavirus test. Provincetown officials issued a new mask advisory on Monday after more than 100 people tested positive following the Fourth of July holiday. The advisory encourages mask-wearing for all residents and visitors of the town, which is a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Marais: A wildfire burned about 6 acres of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and adjacent state forest in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard vessel reported the fire about 3 p.m. Monday near the Twelvemile Beach campground at Pictured Rocks, they said. Park rangers said large amounts of smoke might linger for the next few days in the area and along Highway 58 near the Kingston Lake campground. The investigation into how the fire started is continuing. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Burt Township firefighters and Pictured Rocks park rangers extinguished the fire.“Thank you to all our agency partners who reported and helped us keep this fire under control,” Chief Ranger Joseph Hughes said in a statement. “I would like to remind all park visitors to recreate safely. Drivers and visitors should slow down and use caution in the area.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota’s most populous county is boosting its incentive program for COVID-19 vaccine shots. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved an additional $250,000 to promote vaccine shots, on top of the original $100,000 that was allocated earlier from federal recovery funds. Commissioner Chris LaTondresse said the program has increased the number of shots and Tuesday’s action “doubles down on this promising strategy” to help fight the coronavirus. The county used the original investment to buy 2,235 Visa gift cards worth $50 each. As of Monday. about 775 of those cards had been distributed, mainly at county public health events. The incentive program includes partnerships with community groups to host vaccine events and provide perks such as free meals, groceries, and entertainment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With a national moratorium on evictions scheduled to end at the end of this month, millions of dollars in federal rental and utility assistance is still available for low-income tenants in Mississippi. The funds, provided by Congress, are disbursed through the Mississippi Home Corporation. Eligible for the benefits are Mississippians making 80% or less of the median area income whose ability to pay rent or utilities was disrupted by the pandemic. For example, in Hinds County, a three-person household making $52,300 or less a year is eligible for assistance. There is more than $180 million available to state residents, and Home Corporation Executive Director Scott Spivey said he hopes more people apply for the assistance.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The St. Louis area is facing a third wave of COVID-19 that could cause more deaths and serious cases if residents don’t get vaccinated and return to wearing masks in public, the head of the region’s pandemic task force said. Dr. Clay Dunagan, BJC HealthCare’s chief clinical officer, said seven COVID-19 patients have died in the St. Louis region and 91 were admitted to intensive care units during the 24 hours before he issued his plea Tuesday morning. He said if residents don’t respond, the area could return to high hospitalization rates, prompting renewed visitor restrictions and delayed elective procedures. He said even people who have been vaccinated should wear masks in public, in part because only 46.3% of Missourians had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, which significantly trailed the national average. Also Tuesday, officials from St. Louis County and St. Louis issued a joint statement echoing Dunagan’s remarks. They said they are watching trends and paying attention to mask mandates initiated by other jurisdictions.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Environmental groups pressed a state judge to order a new review of a Montana copper mine over worries that mining waste will pollute a river that’s popular among boaters. Attorneys for Trout Unlimited and other groups argued that state officials did not adequately review the risk of toxic waste spills from the Black Butte copper mine north of White Sulphur Springs. Work began last year on the mine along Sheep Creek, a tributary of the Smith River. Montana Department of Environmental Quality attorney Sarah Clerget rejected worries the mine would pollute the Smith during Friday’s hearing before state District Judge Katherine Bidegary in Meagher County. Clerget said the mine won’t leak or fail, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The underground mine proposed by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. The 110-mile Smith River runs through a limestone canyon and a scenic valley before flowing into the Missouri River south of Great Falls. The waterway is so popular the state holds an annual lottery for permits to float down it.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinnebago: A mask mandate has been reinstated on the Winnebago Reservation to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska said in a post on its Facebook page that masks are required for all indoors in public buildings and places of business within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. During a meeting Monday, the Winnebago Tribal Council voted 6-1 to reinstate the mask mandate. According to a report from Twelve Clans Unity Hospital, as of Monday, there were 12 active cases of the virus on the reservation and six households in quarantine. On June 25, the Winnebago Public Health Department reported that 70% of community members ages 12 and up had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Tribal officials touted the vaccination rate as the highest in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei said he hasn’t decided whether to run for reelection or mount a bid for Nevada governor, but appears unimpressed by the Republican primary field vying to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Certainly no one has sucked the air out of the room, in a Republican primary sense, which Steve Sisolak must be happy about. Nevada Republicans need a strong gubernatorial candidate in 2022,” he said. Amodei, a Carson City Republican, said he didn’t feel rushed to make a decision with the primary election 11 months away. If he enters the race, Amodei will join Sheriff Joe Lombardo, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee and Reno attorney Joey Gilbert in the Republican primary field. Former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller has told Republican groups that he’s also mulling a run. Amodei has served in Congress since 2011 and previously represented Carson City in the Nevada statehouse. He continues to raise campaign contributions toward another congressional run.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: Surveyors with the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands have found widespread defoliation attributed to a population boom of moth caterpillars. Kyle Lombard, the coordinator of the division’s forest health program, said that the department has surveyed 20% of the state and found 30,000 acres of defoliation. The affected trees are primarily clumps of red and black oaks, WCVB-TV reported. According to the department, the last time the state experienced more than 10,000 to 15,000 acres of defoliation was in 1992. Lombard said that areas with a lot of oaks will look weird; however, the defoliation should not affect the foliage season. The trees that largely produce the bright oranges, reds and yellows are primarily maples, aspens and ash, which are not affected by the moth larvae. Lombard said that the real concern is that if the moth population continues to expand, it will increase the amount of dry brush across a larger area, increasing the risk of fires.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A state appeals court ruled Gov. Phil Murphy didn’t overstep his authority when he issued an executive order last year allowing tenants to use their security deposits to pay rent. The ruling rejected arguments by several businesses and individual landlords who argued Murphy wasn’t authorized to issue the order in April 2020 and that their due process rights were violated. In a tweet, Acting State Attorney General Andrew Bruck praised the ruling and said Murphy’s executive order “supported renters and helped keep them in their homes.” The attorney general’s office argued the case on behalf of Murphy, a Democrat; former attorney general Gurbir Grewal and state health commissioner Judy Persichilli, who also were named as defendants. Under Murphy’s order, landlords were still entitled to reimbursement for expenses that would have been covered by a security deposit, and tenants were obligated to replenish the deposit in full if they renewed the lease.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMalaga: The U.S. Geological Survey recorded an earthquake near the Eddy and Lea County line Monday morning, nearly 23 miles east-southeast of Malaga. Susan Torres, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department , said the earthquake was reported about 5:30 a.m. The USGS considered the earthquake light. The Carlsbad Brine Well remediation project, located south of Carlsbad where U.S. highways 285 and 62/180 converge to form the South Y, detected the activity. The readings indicated the Brine Well pressure was stable. Eddy County Fire and Rescue Chief Joshua Mack said volunteer fire departments did not respond to any emergency calls in the area. Carlsbad Fire Chief Richard Lopez said no damage or injuries were reported in the city limits. The USGS has reported six other earthquakes near the Texas-New Mexico state line nearly 60 miles south of Carlsbad since July 13. The magnitude of those earthquakes was less than 4.0.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will have to get vaccinated or get tested weekly under a policy announced Wednesday to fight a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Publicly employed nurses, doctors, social workers, custodians, registrars and colleagues will be covered under the order from city Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi, and Mayor Bill de Blasio didn’t rule out applying the same requirement to teachers, police officers and other city employees. The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated. But the rate among public hospital system workers is lower: about 60%, according to Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs it. Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children would need parental permission before they could receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use in legislation that advanced through a state Senate committee Wednesday. The parent or guardian requirement is contained in a bill approved by the Senate Health Care Committee that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The permission is designed to address concerns by some parents and legislators that young people could get a new COVID-19 immunization on their own while it is still authorized for emergency use, said Sen. Jim Burgin, a Harnett County Republican. Only the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is available to children from 12 to 17. North Carolina law allows these children to make the decision on their own, “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Oil production is flat in North Dakota because of a workforce shortage as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Companies said they are in need of workers to inject water, sand and chemicals down wells to crack open rock and release oil, a process known as hydraulic fracking. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said eight crews are working in North Dakota, down from at least 20 which would typically be working in the state at today’s oil prices. “Most of these folks went to Texas where activity was still significantly higher than it was here, where they didn’t have winter and where there were jobs in their industry,” Helms told the Bismarck Tribune. “It’s going to take higher pay and housing incentives and that sort of thing to get them here.” North Dakota’s oil production rose 4,000 barrels per day in May, a negligible increase. The state produced about 1 million barrels of oil per day in May, the latest month for which data is available. The fracking side of the industry is also experimenting with new techniques to reduce costs. One company is using saltwater to replace some of the freshwater used in the fracking process. The fluid is being transported several miles through a flat line hose tucked inside another hose to prevent leaks until it reaches a fracking site, Helms said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio anti-abortion group is protesting a local Catholic university’s involvement in playing host to President Joe Biden in a CNN town hall Wednesday night. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati urged members of the public Tuesday to call Mount St. Joseph University and Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis Schnurr to object to the school’s decision. The group, which opposes abortion, said the suburban Cincinnati university is playing host to the “most pro-abortion president in U.S. history.” Biden, the nation’s second Catholic president, has said he supports abortion rights for others while personally opposing the procedure. He and other Catholic politicians who take Communion while supporting abortion rights were the subject of a rebuke by U.S. bishops last month. The university defended its involvement in the event, saying in a statement that Mount St. Joseph “has always been and will continue to be a diverse and inclusive place where people from different races, ethnicities, social backgrounds, beliefs, and religions can come together to discuss and share their unique perspectives.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A coalition of state health officials pleaded with Oklahomans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus as the number of cases and hospitalizations rise in the state. Aaron Wendelboe, an epidemiologist at the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health, said hospitalizations have nearly tripled since June. The state health department reported a seven-day average of 733 new cases daily, double the average of 364 from a week ago. “On average, each infected person with COVID is transmitting it to 2.9 other people,” compared to each infected person who transmitted the illness to two people in June, Wendelboe said. The health department reported a three-day average of 409 people hospitalized with COVID, almost four times the average of 116 in late June, topping 400 for the first time since early June. Assistant Deputy Health Commissioner Buffy Heater said 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, “which further indicates to us that vaccines are safe and continue to be effective against all strains or all variants of COVID.” Oklahoma ranks ninth in the nation with 209.2 new virus cases per 100,000 residents, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is being forced to make immediate and extensive changes to the way it operates the 13 dams in the Willamette Valley, including Detroit Dam, to give native species of fish a chance to survive. Under an order from U.S. District Court Judge Marco Hernandez issued July 16, the Corps will be forced to take actions such as improving fish passage and water quality, deep drawdowns of water to allow juvenile fish to pass downstream, spilling water at different times of year, and releasing adult fish above the dams. Hernandez's order laid out broad actions; a later final judgment will contain specifics. According to a statement from the Corps, it is reviewing Hernandez’s opinion to determine the next steps it will take to comply with it.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Local Catholics attending Mass last Sunday sounded happy that Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson Pérez has reinstated the religious obligation to attend Mass in person starting next month, ending a 16-month dispensation during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think he should have done it a long time ago,” said Nathan Hook, just before he and his fiancée, Jessica Rosario, walked into St. Agatha-St. James Church in West Philadelphia. “The dispensation makes people think church isn’t that important. But you need to be in person to receive the sacraments.” The in-person attendance directive, effective Aug. 15, has exceptions. Just as before the pandemic, the church recognizes that people might not be able to gather in person because of illness, caregiving responsibilities, or health risks. Pérez’s statement said lingering pandemic anxiety about crowds is also a valid reason to stay home and, if possible, join online.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s courts are preparing to resume regular operations this fall. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell issued an executive order that will lift most coronavirus restrictions by Sept. 7. The Boston Globe reported the new order will allow the public to return to all judicial buildings, with some restrictions. Fully vaccinated people will not be required to wear a mask, unless judges mandate it in their courtrooms. The public will be able to file court documents in-person by Sept. 7. Coronavirus cleaning protocols and plexiglass safety barriers installed in courtrooms will remain at least until the end of the year. During the early days of the pandemic, Suttell ordered courts shuttered for all but emergency matters. Like other court systems, most judicial proceedings were held remotely. The court system has been easing back into in-person operations with grand juries and bench trials resuming last summer. Jury trials resumed late last year as some courtrooms were outfitted with plexiglass.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Three Republican U.S. House members have lost appeals challenging fines for not wearing face coverings on the House floor earlier this year. On Tuesday, the U.S. House Ethics Committee released statements noting that U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina had failed in their appeals of $500 fines issued in May. The Republicans challenged the fines in June, arguing that the mandate was out of sync with recent federal guidance on face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vote in question happened a week after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance noting that “fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing.” At the time, face coverings were still required on the floor, a mandate put in place by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in June 2020. Even after the updated CDC guidance in May, Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, wrote that “mask requirement and other guidelines remain unchanged until all Members and floor staff are fully vaccinated.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A fraternity of the far-right group Proud Boys has withdrawn its sponsorship of a street dance in the town of Scotland in September. David Finnell applied on behalf of the group to have the street dance from noon until midnight Sept. 18 in the Bon Homme County community of about 700 people. The City Council approved the request to close a section of the city street as required for alcohol consumption and food vendors. Finnell, in a Facebook message to KELO-TV, said the Proud Boys were dropping sponsorship of the event out of concerns for safety. He did not elaborate. Scotland’s city attorney, Kent Lehr, said although the Proud Boys have gained some negative national attention, there have not been any problems locally. It’s his understanding that several local or area residents are associated with the Proud Boys, Lehr said. “I’m not saying the city is condoning or agreeing with what the group says,” Lehr said. The council had to evaluate the street dance request from the Proud Boys as it evaluates any other request, he said. “It has to consider the benefit to the community, any potential disruption (to closing street and caused by the event), the benefit to businesses on Main Street,” Lehr said. Finnell said the Proud Boys planned to raise money for local nonprofits before deciding on Monday to withdraw from the event.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials said they have finished deconstructing emergency COVID-19 care sites in Nashville and Memphis. According to a news release, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said this week that the sites finished serving their purpose of providing additional hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients. “Tennessee’s alternate care sites provided our health care system with a margin of safety, and thankfully we did not need to open either site,” Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement. The Memphis site, which was the former home of The Commercial Appeal, was renovated to provide more than 400 beds. The Nashville site opened in late May and provided 67 beds. “The Memphis and Nashville sites are models of what the public and private sector can accomplish working together,” TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan said in a statement. All medical equipment and supplies from both sites have been returned to TEMA’s warehouse.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Emergency officials have lifted a shelter-in-place order that was issued Wednesday morning for parts of a Houston-area city after a chemical release at a plant. The order had been issued for parts of La Porte, a city about 25 miles southeast of Houston. La Porte Emergency Management said earlier that residents in the affected area should stay indoors, turn their air conditioning off and close windows. Dow Chemical, which operates a plant in the area, said in a public alert message that a “release event” from a tank truck had occurred but did not specify what chemicals were involved. Harris County Pollution Control said in a statement that a tank wagon overpressurized, which caused a release of the chemical hydroxyethyl acrylate. The chemical can cause irritation of the nose and throat, the statement said. An evacuation order remained in place for people within a half-mile of the plant, which is located in an industrial area.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The Utah County sheriff is offering an active-shooter training class for teachers and it has filled up long before its start date. Trainers at the Teachers Academy include police, self-defense trainers and medical professionals for the 20-hour course informed by lessons learned in other active shooter incidents, the Daily Herald reported. Topics covered during the Teacher Academy training will include tactical emergency medical techniques, weapons familiarization, Utah concealed carry certification, tactical de-escalation, self-defense and live range-shooting. This is the third Teachers Academy class held since 2019. It’s designed for teachers, administrators, and school support staff. Participants for the session beginning Aug. 3 are limited to 30 people, and spots have already filled up and a wait list has started.\n\nVermont\n\nHyde Park: Grappling with a changed industry, two brothers operating their family’s dairy farm have made the drastic decision to give up hundreds of cows for goats. The Jones family, which had raised cows for 150 years at Joneslan Farm, houses about 1,000 goats in their barn that remains adorned with painted cutouts of dairy cattle. Fluctuating milk prices paid to dairy cow farmers and rising costs have driven some small family farms to go big or out of business – or get creative like brothers Brian and Steven. The Jones brothers finished constructing their nanny-milking parlor and delivered their first goat milk earlier this year to Land O’ Lakes-owned Vermont Creamery, to be used for cheese-making. They plan to milk 1,200 to 1,500 dairy goats within two years. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of dairy cow farms fell by more than half between 2003 and 2020 while the number of cows nationwide grew as farms consolidated. At the same time, the dairy goat industry in the U.S. has grown significantly in the last 20 years, with the number of dairy goats rising from more than 190,000 in 1997 to 440,000 last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration issued new guidance Wednesday on COVID-19 prevention measures for the upcoming school year, urging but not requiring continued masking in many circumstances. With a statewide public health order that had mandated masking in schools coming to an end Sunday, school divisions will have the ability to implement local policies “based on community level conditions and public health recommendations,” the Democratic administration said in a news release. The departments of health and education released a 14-page document with advice about reducing the spread of the coronavirus, addressing issues like ventilation and physical distancing, in addition to masking. The recommendations urge school divisions for now to adopt a universal masking policy for students and adults in elementary schools, regardless of vaccination status, because no vaccine has been approved yet for children under 12. For middle and high schools, the state guidance said that “at a minimum” teachers, students and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated should wear masks indoors. The guidance provides flexibility for school divisions while ensuring a safe and healthy environment, Northam said in a statement, which also encouraged Virginians to get vaccinated if they have not already.\n\nWashington\n\nKelso: Authorities are searching for an Army lieutenant reported missing near Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington. The Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office said crews are searching for a missing hiker, identified as 1st Lt. Brian Yang in the Coldwater area of Mount St. Helens. KOIN reported Yang, 25, was last seen at the Coldwater Trail Head about noon Sunday. According to its Twitter account, the Army’s I Corps is aware of Yang’s absence and is also involved in the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Dozens of labor and advocacy groups called on President Joe Biden to save nearly 1,500 jobs at a pharmaceutical plant in West Virginia scheduled to close at the end of July. Drugmaker Viatris Inc. announced in December it will lay off workers at the Morgantown plant, formerly operated by the generic drug company Mylan. Upjohn and Mylan’s merged last year to form the new company, which announced it would slash 20% of its workforce worldwide. Viatris is now one of the world’s dominant manufacturers in the generics industry, which has been consolidating for years. The moves left workers scrambling to find new jobs as the major employer left West Virginia, which is often trying to lure new companies to uplift the state’s stagnant economy. A new campaign led by Our Revolution, a political nonprofit organization founded by Bernie Sanders, urged Biden to use the Defense Production Act to halt Pittsburgh-based Viatris from closing the plant. It also asks Biden to convene a task force of labor groups, local leaders and others to determine how the plant might continue producing pharmaceutical or medical goods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is again asking ruffed grouse hunters to submit samples during the final year of a four-year, multistate ruffed grouse West Nile virus study. The DNR and conservation partners will distribute testing kits to hunters to get more samples as biologists try to determine how many grouse are getting West Nile and what impacts the disease is having on the grouse population. Anyone else who finds a sick or entact dead grouse can also submit samples. Hunters who have a kit from a previous year are encouraged to collect a sample, fill the kit and send it in to be processed; nothing in the kit expires. Kits will be available in early September. The DNR might limit the number of kits per individual to ensure samples come from a large geographic area. The DNR will provide test results via email. Sample testing will not begin until after the grouse season has closed and final results will not be available for several months after that. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus and its effects on birds can vary. Signs range from no clinical disease or illness to heart lesions and inflammation of the brain’s lining and spinal cord. There is no evidence that West Nile can be spread by handling dead birds or consuming properly cooked game.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon is allowing truck drivers to work longer hours while they deliver fuel that might be needed for firefighting aircraft. So far this summer, Wyoming hasn’t had significant fuel shortages or major wildfires. Gordon’s office described Tuesday’s executive order as a preemptive measure because of high fuel demand amid record tourism and firefighting efforts elsewhere. “Part of the reason he signed the executive order was really to make sure that it wasn’t a transportation hiccup that was preventing fuel from making it to its destination,” Gordon spokesman Michael Pearlman told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other Western governors, including South Dakota’s Kristi Noem, have signed similar orders. Government rules usually limit truck drivers’ road hours to prevent fatigue-related accidents. The Wyoming order still prohibits truck drivers from driving when tired.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/09/conch-contest-golf-tree-geena-davis-news-around-states/111409522/", "title": "Conch contest, golf tree: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would ban gender therapies such as prescription hormones or gender confirmation surgery for minors. The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}]}

The dress code, \"in honor of Karl,\" pays tribute to his decades-long work as creative director of many fashion houses, including Chanel, Fendi and Chloé.\n\nWhile Lagerfeld is known for his signature style – white hair, black sunglasses and 19th-century-style shirt collars – he is also remembered for his polemical tendencies, having offered unfiltered commentary on migrants, sexual assault survivors, the #MeToo movement and gay men who want to adopt children.\n\n\"He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown,\" New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote soon after Lagerfeld’s death.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the style sage and his polarizing legacy.\n\nMet Gala 2023:How to watch, everything to know as stars dress to honor Karl Lagerfeld\n\nVogue honors Karl Lagerfeld on cover ahead of Met Galawith Naomi Campbell, Gigi Hadid\n\nWho is Karl Lagerfeld?\n\nBorn Karl Otto Lagerfeldt in Hamburg, Germany, Lagerfeld took a strong interest in fashion during his teen years. After moving to Paris at age 14, Lagerfeld – who dropped the \"t\" from his surname to make it sound \"more commercial\" – worked under French designer Pierre Balmain as a junior assistant and later as an apprentice.\n\nFollowing stints with Balmain and Jean Patou’s fashion house, Lagerfeld began designing collections for luxury brands including Chloé, Fendi, Valentino and shoemaker Charles Jourdan. His sartorial stature soared to new heights in the '80s when he revitalized French fashion house Chanel with zeitgeisty looks and launched his own eponymous label.\n\nLagerfeld became a darling of the celebrity world, gaining the admiration of high-profile stars such as Lady Gaga, Kristen Stewart and Beyoncé. Some of these stars, including Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, paid tribute to the designer's legacy by appearing on a commemorative May cover of Vogue alongside other models he \"loved most.\"\n\nLagerfeld was also interested in photography and illustration. His photography work was featured in major outlets such as British Vogue and Interview magazine, as well as Chanel’s ads.\n\nMet Gala 2023 theme, exhibitwill celebrate work of late designer Karl Lagerfeld\n\nMet Gala 2023 date, dress code revealed:Dua Lupa, Michaela Coel to co-chair Karl Lagerfeld-themed event\n\nIs Karl Lagerfeld a designer brand?\n\nLagerfeld launched his label in 1984, and the brand \"combines Parisian classics with a rock-chic attitude and tailored silhouettes,\" according to its official website. Collections feature ready-to-wear looks for men, women and children. The brand also offers an assortment of accessories including watches, bags, eyewear, perfumes and jewelry.\n\nInspired equally by the cerebral and the carnal, Lagerfeld set out to create designs that reflected his self-coined concept of \"intellectual sexiness.\" The label went on to open more than 200 stores across the world, including in Paris, London and New York.\n\nIn 2005, Lagerfeld sold the brand to American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nTommy Hilfiger's NYFW return:Travis Barker closes out rainy outdoor show, Julia Fox models\n\nHow did Karl Lagerfeld die?\n\nLagerfeld died Feb. 19, 2019, around the age of 85 (he reportedly had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938). A cause of death was not given. Lagerfeld had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, worrying fans. He did not come out to take a bow at Chanel's couture show in Paris in January 2019, which the company attributed to fatigue.\n\nSeveral stars and industry colleagues mourned the loss of Lagerfeld and his influence in fashion, including then-Chanel CEO Alain Wertheimer.\n\n\"Thanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time,\" Wertheimer said in a release at the time.\n\nFrom 2019:Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, creative director for Chanel and Fendi, dies\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's cat became a viral sensation\n\nLagerfeld's cat, a white Siamese named Choupette, gave the designer a run for his money in the fame department. The feline amassed over 45,000 followers on Twitter and over 200,000 on Instagram thanks to a pair of fan accounts that featured snarky commentary written from the cat's imagined point of view.\n\nAhead of the Met Gala on Monday, Kim Kardashian posted a series of selfies of her hanging out with Choupette. \"Had a date with (Choupette) in Paris,\" she wrote Wednesday.\n\nLagerfeld's love for Choupette, who he stole from a friend when he was on vacation, ran so deep that he told CNN in a 2013 interview that he wanted to marry his furry companion. \"I never thought I would fall in love like this with a cat,\" he said.\n\nIn a March 2015 interview with The Cut, Lagerfeld revealed Choupette had a pair of personal maids that looked after her, as well as underwent beauty treatments for her eyes.\n\n\"There is something unforgettable about her, the way she moves, the way she plays,\" Lagerfeld told the outlet. \"She’s an inspiration for elegance. For attitude.\"\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's cat has two maids ANDshe does 'eye beauty treatments'\n\nKarl Lagerfeld stirred controversy with comments on #MeToo, Heidi Klum, fatphobia, Adele\n\nWhile Lagerfeld became a fashion heavyweight for his cutting-edge looks, he also had a controversial track record of making statements that were not in vogue.\n\nDuring a 2018 interview with French fashion magazine Numéro, Lagerfeld criticized the #MeToo movement and its impact on the fashion and modeling industries.\n\n\"What shocks me most in all of this are the starlets who have taken 20 years to remember what happened. Not to mention the fact there are no prosecution witnesses,\" Lagerfeld told the outlet. \"I read somewhere that now you must ask a model if she is comfortable with posing. It's simply too much, from now on, as a designer, you can’t do anything.\"\n\nKarl Lagerfeld calls models 'stupid,' 'sordid creatures': Model Alliance fires back\n\nIn the same interview, Lagerfeld insulted models as being \"stupid,\" \"toxic\" and overall \"sordid creatures.\" Sara Ziff, founder of fashion-industry group Model Alliance, called his comments a \"flippant dismissal\" of sexual harassment and abuse in the industry.\n\nLagerfeld, who co-authored a diet book after losing 92 pounds in 13 months, was vocally critical throughout his career of women larger than size 0 or 2. That included his defense of designers exclusively hiring rail-thin runway models. \"Fashion is the healthiest motivation for losing weight,\" he said, according to the book \"The World According to Karl,\" a collection of Lagerfeld quotes.\n\nAsked in a 2009 Focus interview about German women's magazine Brigitte declaring it would only publish photographs of \"real women,\" as opposed to professional models, Lagerfeld said, \"You’ve got fat mothers with their bags of chips sitting in front of the television and saying that thin models are ugly. The world of beautiful clothing is about 'dreams and illusions.'\"\n\nLagerfeld also publicly shared critiques of certain celebrities. In 2009, he called supermodel Heidi Klum \"insignificant\" in the fashion world because she was \"too glamorous\"; he criticized singer Adele as \"a little too fat\" in 2012; and later that year he dissed Pippa Middleton's face, suggesting she only show her backside.\n\nHe even got into a fracas with Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep when he claimed in 2017 that she dropped out of wearing a Chanel dress to that year’s Academy Awards in favor of a brand that would pay her.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld criticized immigration, same-sex marriage\n\nA self-professed \"big mouth,\" Lagerfeld sounded off on sociopolitical issues, including immigration and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2017, Lagerfeld sniped at Angela Merkel, then the German chancellor, for opening Germany's borders to migrants during the Syrian refugee crisis in Europe two years prior.\n\nIn some English translations of his appearance on French talk show \"Salut les Terriens!\" Lagerfeld offered this anecdote: \"I know someone in Germany who took (in) a young Syrian and after four days said: 'The greatest thing Germany invented was the Holocaust.'\"\n\nNick Cannon on 'growth' since 2020 antisemitic remarks, 'educational' podcast with ADL CEO\n\nLagerfeld rebuked same-sex marriage in a 2010 interview with Vice magazine, particularly as it pertains to two men.\n\n\"For me it’s difficult to imagine – one of the papas at work and the other at home with the baby. How would that be, for the baby? I don’t know,\" Lagerfeld said. \"I see more lesbians married with babies than I see boys married with babies. And I also believe more in the relationship between mother and child than in that between father and child.\"\n\nIn a seeming about-face, Lagerfeld sent two brides in identical wedding dresses down the runway for the finale of his spring 2013 Chanel haute couture show in Paris, telling The Guardian it was a show of support for the French same-sex marriage law. However, he also said he was \"less keen\" on same-sex couples being allowed to adopt.\n\nStraight couples get married earlier than gay couples.Here's a look at why.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Jayme Deerwester and Cindy Clark Kramer, USA TODAY; Leanne Italie, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/05/02/met-gala-hair-2023-beauty-products/70174832007/", "title": "Met Gala 2023: See the most stunning celebrity looks", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\n\"Fashion's biggest night\"—better known as the Met Gala—is here. This year's sartorial theme, \"in honor of Karl,\" pays tribute to the late fashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld, and aligns with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute's new exhibition called \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.\" Though the theme prioritized Lagerfeld's work with famous fashion houses such as Chloé, Fendi and Chanel, the majority of the event's A-list guests carried Lagerfeld's chic design philosophy over to their beauty looks. Below, we've compiled some of the best Met Gala 2023 beauty looks that walked the red carpet.\n\n1. Dua Lipa's eyeliner\n\nDua Lipa, singer-songwriter and Met Gala 2023 co-chair, sported an on-theme makeup look that included shades commonly found in Lagerfeld's designs—i.e., black and white. Her beat looks to one of the year's biggest makeup trends as well: lining the lower waterline with white eyeliner (current TikTok 'it girl' Alix Earle got everyone hooked on the look late last year). We're guessing that the YSL Beauty ambassador's makeup artist, Samantha Lau, used some of the brand's products on Lipa's eyes, but you can certainly find an affordable white eyeliner to get in on the trend of the moment. We suggest the NYX Retractable Long-Lasting Mechanical Eyeliner Pencil in \"White,\" as it promises to last all day, even through elements like heat and humidity.\n\n2. Emma Chamberlain's eyeshadow\n\nEmma Chamberlain's Miu Miu ensemble was blue, blue and more blue; specifically, a pastel iteration of the color—perfect for spring, right? The light hue of blue also made its way into her eye makeup look. Her go-to makeup artist Kelsea Deenihan, mixed a variety of shades from four Lancôme eyeshadow palettes to decorate the brand ambassadress's eyes. The Hypnôse Five-Color Eyeshadow Palettes in \"Bleu Hypnotique,\" \"Reflet D'Améthyste,\" \"Smokey Chic\" and \"Drama Denim\" were all involved in the process.\n\n4. Gigi Hadid's beach waves\n\nAre Gigi Hadid's flowing beach waves a tribute to her California roots? We sure think so. Though it is unknown if the model's long locks are the work of extensions or a hair waver, this hairstyle is far from being out of reach. To get Hadid's loose waves, you can use the Reviewed-approved Hot Tools Pro Artist 24K Gold 3 Barrel Hair Waver. Our tester, Brigitt Earley, named the styling tool as the best hair waver, namely for its ability to produce \"instant S-shaped waves that held steady all day long.\" Furthermore, Earley confirmed that the look is rather easy to create on your own, as it only took her 15 minutes to complete.\n\n5. Cara Delevingne's eyelashes\n\nModel and longtime friend of the late Karl Lagerfeld Cara Delevingne brought all the drama and suspense to the red carpet when she showed off the train of her white t-shirt dress. The drama continued over to her beauty look, which was made complete with some false eyelashes from Ardell. Makeup artist Hung Vanngo used the Ardell Naked Lashes in \"420\" \"because those strip lashes blend seamlessly into her natural lashes,\" Vanngo shared in a statement. He also leaned on the brand's FauxMink Individual Lashes in medium and long for some \"extra drama.\"\n\n6. Kim Kardashian's hair straightener\n\nFor \"fashion's biggest night,\" reality star Kim Kardashian opted for an updo with some face-framing layers that skim slightly below her chin. Kardashian's go-to hairstylist and close confidante, Chris Appleton, was behind the voluminous look. The styling affair involved loose curls atop of curls, and Appleton used the Dyson Corrale Hair Style Straightener to make them. In a statement, the hairstylist noted that he set the hair tool to the \"365°F setting, wrapping the hair around the iron to create curls while polishing the fringe in front that is left out.\"\n\n7. Doja Cat's lip combination\n\nDoja Cat's fashionable feline look was either a tribute to herself or to the late Chanel designer's beloved cat, Choupette—you decide. Nonetheless, the singer's interpretation of the night's theme got some help from Charlotte Tilbury. Doja's makeup artist, Ernesto Casillas, used a variety of products from the beloved beauty brand, but what stood out the most was the lip combination. To line the lips, Casillas reached for the bestselling Lip Cheat Lipliner in \"Pillow Talk\" (pink nude), along with the Matte Revolution Lipstick in the same shade.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Monday night on the steps of the Met, stars showed up in tweed, sheer black and Old Hollywood-inspired looks.\n\nThough some Met Gala favorites including Blake Lively and Zendaya didn't show this year, stars including Rihanna, Bad Bunny and Dua Lipa brought their A-games and delivered fashion moments we won't soon forget.\n\nIn no particular order, these were the eight best dressed stars at the 2023 Met Gala.\n\nBiggest Met Gala 2023 moments:Rihanna closes red carpet, Kim Kardashian honors Karl Lagerfeld\n\nOop, exes at the Met:Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson both attend the 2023 Met Gala, photographed speaking inside\n\nRihanna was fashionably late − but, more importantly, fashionable\n\nRihanna was fashionably late but always worth the wait. The music superstar arrived more than an hour and 15 minutes after the Met Gala carpet was scheduled to conclude, hand in hand with partner A$AP Rocky. Rihanna, who revealed the couple is expecting their second child onstage at the Super Bowl earlier this year, looked decidedly bridal in a floor-length white Valentino gown with oversized white floral appliques that formed a hood over her head. She later removed the hood to reveal layered necklaces and a thin-strap gown underneath. The Fenty Beauty founder completed the look with fingerless white gloves and white sunglasses that appeared to have false eyelashes attached to the lenses.\n\nDua Lipa's tweed bridal gown (and 'Ocean's Eight'-esque necklace)\n\nPop star Dua Lipa, a co-chair for the 2023 gala, became an early best dressed contender with a white tweed Chanel fall/winter 1992 bride couture gown designed by Lagerfeld. She paired the look with an enormous rock of a diamond Tiffany necklace that has the cast of \"Ocean's Eight\" salivating − per the jewelry brand, the diamond, set in platinum, is more than 200 carats.

He told Variety he loves \"the androgyny of\" the design: \"It's a part of who we are. We're all flavors and we can be all things. I feel like that's the way fashion should lean: Be who you are, show who you are, show all the flavors you've got.\"\n\nBest dressed or no?Nicole Kidman dazzles in custom Chanel dress designed by Karl Lagerfeld at Met Gala\n\nDoja Cat is ... an actual cat\n\nWe were hoping someone would pay tribute to Lagerfeld's famous cat, Choupette. Of course, it was Doja Cat herself. The Grammy-winning singer is known for her cutting-edge makeup looks, so naturally she had to one-up herself for her first Met appearance. Doja Cat stepped out on the carpet with a prosthetic cat face, rounding out the feline fashion moment with a glittering and feathered silver gown by Oscar de la Renta topped with a cat-ear hood.\n\nAnok Yai dazzled with mixed metals\n\nSupermodel Anok Yai, who appears on the May 2023 cover of Vogue, dazzled in a sparkling strapless Prabal Gurung mini dress that blended from a gold sequined bodice into a silver fringed skirt. She told Vogue it was inspired by Lagerfeld's 1993 Chanel show, specifically a look modeled by Cindy Crawford.\n\nPedro Pascal gives his TikTok fanbase new material\n\nActor Pedro Pascal has amassed a collection of fans on TikTok who love a video edit of his greatest moments − see his viral \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.

The singer and actress delivered two knockout looks: the first, a black and white oversized tweed custom Thom Browne coat with black and white platform boots and an all-white Choupette-shaped handbag. After a mid-staircase quick-change, she revealed a full sheer hoop dress with a black bikini underneath. While this year's gala carpet at times felt quieter than past years, Monáe brought some much-needed drama.\n\n'Fashion does not belong in a museum':Look inside the Karl Lagerfeld exhibit at the Met\n\nBad Bunny was business in the front, party in the back\n\nOur worries that Bad Bunny had fallen to the \"men wearing boring tuxes\" side were for naught. The reggaetón superstar showed off what seemed to be a simple all-white tweed suit from the front, but turned to reveal an open back with a floral, floor-length shawl.\n\nContributing: Morgan Hines and Elise Brisco\n\nMore:See Cardi B's head-turning Karl Lagerfeld looks at the Met Gala\n\nLast year's best dressed:See Kim Kardashian as Marilyn Monroe, Blake Lively's NYC nod, more stars", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/01"}]}
